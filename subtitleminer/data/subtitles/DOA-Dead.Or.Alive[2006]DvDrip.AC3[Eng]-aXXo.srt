1
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,970
Princess Kasumi.

2
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:25,293
Your brother is dead.
Your destiny is to lead your people.

3
00:01:30,378 --> 00:01:33,654
I will not believe he is dead
until I see his body.

4
00:01:35,698 --> 00:01:37,290
There is no body.

5
00:01:38,418 --> 00:01:40,215
Then he is not dead.

6
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:45,494
- I am going to find him.
- The guards won't let you leave.

7
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:50,493
I am not a cricket in a box.
I alone determine my destiny.

8
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:54,093
But, Princess, as your brother's best friend
you must let me help you.

9
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:58,330
If my brother is really dead
then you are no longer his best friend.

10
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:04,691
Princess Kasumi, if you leave
you suffer the same fate as your brother.

11
00:02:04,778 --> 00:02:06,734
You'll become an outcast,

12
00:02:07,658 --> 00:02:09,296
a <i>shinobi</i>.

13
00:02:10,418 --> 00:02:11,692
So be it.

14
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:16,846
Princess, the guards will kill you.

15
00:03:15,338 --> 00:03:18,808
Ayane, I know of your love for my brother.

16
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:22,697
I will find Hayate and bring him home.

17
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,056
Princess Kasumi,

18
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:31,087
I beg you, do not leave the clan.

19
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:41,252
I am your servant. But if you leave,
I'm honor-bound to kill you.

20
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:48,095
Miss Armstrong, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but it's your father again.

21
00:04:48,378 --> 00:04:49,936
I told you I'm busy.

22
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:51,337
But, Miss Armstrong, he just...

23
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:54,012
- Okay, put him on speaker.
- Very good.

24
00:04:55,498 --> 00:04:56,772
Hi, Dad, what's up?

25
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:59,326
<i>Sweetheart, I just hope you know</i>
<i>what you're giving up.</i>

26
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:00,931
Dad, we already talked about this.

27
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:03,486
<i>But if you get the afternoon flight,</i>
<i>you can still make it</i>

28
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:05,694
<i>to the Tag Team Championship</i>
<i>in Des Moines.</i>

29
00:05:05,778 --> 00:05:10,374
Dad, I already told you, I am done wrestling.
I'm done being fake. I'm done.

30
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:12,371
<i>Sweetheart?</i>

31
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:15,651
<i>Are you there?</i>

32
00:05:15,738 --> 00:05:18,775
Hey, Dad. I'm gonna have to call you back
in a minute, okay?

33
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:35,846
Miss Armstrong.

34
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:38,611
Miss Armstrong!

35
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:50,496
Here's the deal, lady. We want the yacht.

36
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:53,576
If you do exactly as we say, you'll live.

37
00:05:54,578 --> 00:05:57,536
If you don't,
then you'll pay with excruciating...

38
00:05:57,618 --> 00:05:59,176
No deal, boys.

39
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:06,776
You boys get off my yacht now,
and y'all will avoid excruciating pain.

40
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,330
You need some help, buddy?

41
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:56,047
It's okay. Come on. Come on. It's okay.

42
00:06:56,218 --> 00:06:58,732
I'll give you a hand. Yeah.

43
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:00,973
Yeah.

44
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,814
What do you know?
Looks like I'm going to the ball after all.

45
00:07:32,698 --> 00:07:35,053
- May I help you?
- You're under arrest.

46
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:44,493
Someone broke into the safe
at the Hotel Peking last night.

47
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:49,531
Stole cash and diamonds.
We received an anonymous tip it was you.

48
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:51,969
- It was Max.
- He said it was you.

49
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:55,168
You just said your tip was anonymous.

50
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:57,856
Tell me about the diamonds.

51
00:07:57,938 --> 00:08:00,452
Well, they're a girl's best friend.

52
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,452
Made from carbon
subjected to high pressure.

53
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:06,211
Traditionally a 60th wedding
anniversary gift.

54
00:08:06,898 --> 00:08:08,297
And they're forever.

55
00:08:08,378 --> 00:08:11,973
Well, perhaps spending a few hours
in a cold cell under some hot lights

56
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,652
will make you a little more agreeable.

57
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:18,368
- Could I at least get dressed first?
- Be my guest.

58
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:46,167
Would you hand me my bra, please?

59
00:09:17,138 --> 00:09:18,412
Do me up.

60
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:42,606
Evening.

61
00:10:09,418 --> 00:10:11,249
Hey, you okay?

62
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,210
Kasumi has abandoned the temple.

63
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:52,734
She has become <i>shinobi</i>, an outcast.

64
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:57,334
A disgrace to the clan
like her brother before her.

65
00:10:58,498 --> 00:11:00,250
You must follow her.

66
00:11:00,938 --> 00:11:03,168
Find her and kill her.

67
00:11:08,978 --> 00:11:13,051
Welcome to the world's greatest
martial arts tournament, DOA.

68
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:17,649
<i>I'm Helena Douglas and I want</i>
<i>to thank you for accepting our invitation.</i>

69
00:11:17,818 --> 00:11:19,968
<i>Each of you has been individually selected</i>

70
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:23,937
<i>because you represent the best</i>
<i>fighting style in your specialized field.</i>

71
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:28,808
<i>Soon you will get a chance to prove</i>
<i>that you are the best fighter in the world.</i>

72
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:32,208
<i>And at the same time,</i>
<i>pick up a $10 million prize.</i>

73
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:36,211
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>relax before the real fun begins.</i>

74
00:11:36,298 --> 00:11:39,608
God, this is so embarrassing, Dad.
I cannot believe you're here.

75
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:42,007
What? I got an invitation just like you.

76
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:45,215
Tina Armstrong. Baby.

77
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,291
So, how come you're here?

78
00:11:47,378 --> 00:11:50,848
That lady just said,
"The best in your fighting style."

79
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:55,735
Now if I recall, you're a wrestler.
Wrestling ain't really fighting, now is it?

80
00:11:55,818 --> 00:11:58,810
- Don't worry, Tina, he's beneath you.
- I sure would like to be.

81
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:00,776
- Son of a...
- Dad.

82
00:12:02,218 --> 00:12:03,537
Whatever.

83
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:08,966
God, I cannot wait to kick his ass.

84
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:14,813
- Why do you follow me?
- I was invited to DOA.

85
00:12:15,978 --> 00:12:19,448
- I promise not to harm you.
- Unless we meet in a match.

86
00:12:19,978 --> 00:12:22,811
- Max.
- Oh, no.

87
00:12:23,698 --> 00:12:24,892
Max!

88
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,173
Listen, I don't know
who you're pretending to be

89
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:32,297
or how you got yourself invited to DOA,

90
00:12:33,658 --> 00:12:37,856
but what I do know is you left me alone
in my Hong Kong hotel room.

91
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:41,650
I would never leave
such a woman as you alone.

92
00:12:42,058 --> 00:12:44,253
Especially not in a hotel room.

93
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:47,213
I'm winning the $10 million prize money.

94
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:51,416
And if I get to put your double-dealing arse
in the "D" column of "Dead or Alive",

95
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:54,496
so much the better.

96
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:57,654
Let me help you with that.

97
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:02,296
<i>Hey, everybody.</i>
<i>I hope you're enjoying the flight.</i>

98
00:13:02,378 --> 00:13:04,846
<i>My welcome gift to you is this.</i>

99
00:13:04,938 --> 00:13:07,975
<i>To get to DOA Island</i>
<i>you have to bail out now.</i>

100
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:10,573
<i>Parachutes are under your seats.</i>

101
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:14,567
<i>Just aim for the Buddha on your left.</i>
<i>Have fun.</i>

102
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:16,246
<i>Oh, and one more thing.</i>

103
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:19,967
<i>Whoever doesn't make it to the compound</i>
<i>by sundown is disqualified.</i>

104
00:13:26,218 --> 00:13:28,493
Princess, allow me to go first.

105
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:05,807
Looks like we landed off target.

106
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,773
How in hell
are we supposed to get up there?

107
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:15,211
We'd better get going.

108
00:14:15,298 --> 00:14:18,370
Well, you're both on your own.
I don't do teams.

109
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:22,371
That's fine with me. Any team you're part of
is bound to lose anyway.

110
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:26,246
Well, I'll remember that
when I'm collecting the $10 million.

111
00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:30,936
Okay. Here goes.

112
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,812
Race you.

113
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:21,137
If we're going to make it,
we need to work together.

114
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:44,487
Hey!

115
00:15:46,818 --> 00:15:47,967
Sorry.

116
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:13,210
Oh, God, what are you doing down there?
Jesus, hurry up.

117
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:19,691
We've gotta go.

118
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:21,847
Thanks, guys.

119
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:29,773
Hey, what took you guys so long?

120
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:32,295
Who the hell is that?

121
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:35,607
Trust me, you don't want to know.

122
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,456
Welcome to DOA. Glad you made it.

123
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:54,012
I'm afraid you guys were the last to arrive.

124
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:58,011
Now, if you'll all follow me,
I will conduct you to the others.

125
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:12,127
<i>DOA combatants, your host,</i>
<i>Dr. Victor Donovan.</i>

126
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:17,856
Welcome to you all.

127
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:25,095
Dead or Alive was created
by the late great Fame Douglas,

128
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:28,371
Helena's father and my very good friend.

129
00:17:29,378 --> 00:17:31,653
Fame's will decreed this tournament,

130
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:36,607
and as of this year, marking her
21st birthday, Helena's participation.

131
00:17:37,298 --> 00:17:39,812
My assistants will escort you to the lab

132
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:42,696
where you will now undergo
a complete physical.

133
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:48,173
<i>Once you pass your physicals,</i>
<i>DOA begins.</i>

134
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:52,137
Hey, this thing kind of reminds me
of a disco.

135
00:17:57,178 --> 00:17:58,213
- Zack.
- Yo.

136
00:17:58,298 --> 00:18:01,176
May I please remind you
of the importance of this procedure?

137
00:18:01,258 --> 00:18:03,772
It's important, I know.
But you can't stop Zack, man.

138
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:05,894
You can only hope to contain him a little bit.

139
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:15,254
So, what do you got there,
some modern kind of dentistry chair?

140
00:18:16,978 --> 00:18:18,696
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.
- It's okay.

141
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:43,292
Weatherby, have you got those
diagnostic reports I requested?

142
00:18:43,378 --> 00:18:46,814
Thank you.
And how do our contestants look?

143
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:50,575
We got a strong group, sir.
They look really good.

144
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:55,730
Bring up Tina Armstrong.
I was impressed with her musculature.

145
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:03,254
Oh, God, this is gonna hurt.

146
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:06,808
Standard procedure, Miss Armstrong.
Everyone's going through this.

147
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:17,137
- Are the nanobots broadcasting?
- Perfectly. All contestants are online.

148
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:19,095
All metabolic functions
and muscle movements

149
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:21,055
are being broadcast
and ready to download to computer.

150
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:24,016
Good. Start a contestant database.

151
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:29,656
We are up and recording.

152
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:35,166
<i>This is Donovan to all combatants.</i>
<i>Welcome to DOA.</i>

153
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:40,735
<i>Fights can happen anytime, anyplace,</i>
<i>against anyone.</i>

155
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:45,693
<i>of the most competitive scenarios.</i>

156
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:49,932

157
00:20:50,018 --> 00:20:51,246
<i>to your ID bracelet.</i>

158
00:20:53,138 --> 00:20:57,575
<i>No weapons are allowed in a DOA fight,</i>
<i>except the human weapon.</i>

159
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:59,216

160
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:08,731
<i>To win,</i>

161
00:21:08,818 --> 00:21:12,572

166
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:08,409
Hey, Helena.

167
00:22:08,898 --> 00:22:10,456
<i>KO.</i>

168
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:12,497

<i>KO. Gen Fu wins.</i>

171
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:58,013
Princess Kasumi, sister of Hayate.

172
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,133
It is an honor to meet you.

173
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:06,255
I came to find my brother.
I have been told he died last year at DOA.

174
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:09,169
I want to know what happened.

175
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:14,248
Your brother was a great and noble fighter.
He met his end with dignity.

176
00:24:15,658 --> 00:24:17,933
Hayate was matched against Leon.

177
00:24:24,858 --> 00:24:28,976
Hayate fell from this very balcony.
We never found his body.

178
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,130
I hope you would choose to stay with us
at the tournament

179
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:37,006
and fight in the same spirit
that made your brother so great.

180
00:24:41,738 --> 00:24:45,890
You will win DOA.
You're the best in the world.

181
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:48,769
Thank you, little sister.

182
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:53,975
When I leave, I will be a <i>shinobi</i>.
But I must accept this challenge.

183
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,688
- I wish I could go with you.
- No.

184
00:24:57,338 --> 00:25:00,648
You have to stay and lead the clan.

185
00:25:02,098 --> 00:25:05,170
Farewell, Kasumi.
Hayabusa will protect you.

186
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:21,657
Hayabusa, why do you invade
my privacy this way?

187
00:25:23,258 --> 00:25:27,171
- She is here.
- I know. I have seen her.

188
00:25:28,738 --> 00:25:33,812
I beg you once again, Princess.
Go home. Ask for forgiveness.

189
00:25:34,978 --> 00:25:37,048
You have a responsibility to your people.

190
00:25:37,138 --> 00:25:40,096
But I also have a responsibility
to my brother.

191
00:25:42,658 --> 00:25:46,776
Donavan is lying. He says Leon
killed Hayate above the Buddha head.

192
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:52,216
- Why would he lie?
- I am convinced he is hiding the truth.

193
00:25:53,858 --> 00:25:55,894
What do you propose to do?

194
00:25:57,178 --> 00:25:58,736
Find my brother.

195
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:04,013
Then I will help you.
Hayate was like a brother to me, too.

196
00:26:15,338 --> 00:26:17,090
Be careful, Kasumi.

197
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:35,896
- I knew you'd miss me.
- That's presumptuous.

198
00:26:35,978 --> 00:26:39,448
No, it's Perrier Jouet Belle Epoch '88.
Your favorite.

199
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:43,692
So how did you survive the first round?

200
00:26:43,778 --> 00:26:46,576
I feigned an injury so Zack went through.

201
00:26:47,498 --> 00:26:50,251
You know I set you up in Hong Kong
on purpose.

202
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:54,370
You'd never have come here
if you'd gotten away with all that money.

203
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:55,811
And you wouldn't have been invited to DOA

204
00:26:55,898 --> 00:26:59,049
without demolishing the pride
of the Hong Kong police.

205
00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:03,575
Don't tell me you want me to help you
steal the $10 million prize money.

206
00:27:03,658 --> 00:27:06,411
Try $100 million.

207
00:27:07,978 --> 00:27:10,970
Just waiting for us in a vault on the island.

208
00:27:12,258 --> 00:27:13,896
What's the catch?

209
00:27:13,978 --> 00:27:18,415
Well, we have to find the vault
and we have to crack the code. The usual.

210
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:24,529
- Shall I tell you more?
- Later.

211
00:27:24,658 --> 00:27:29,413
Right now I'd prefer you do something else
with your mouth.

212
00:27:34,058 --> 00:27:37,414
Well, well, well.
Don't you just love this place?

213
00:27:45,178 --> 00:27:47,373
Know what I especially love?

214
00:27:49,098 --> 00:27:50,417
The view.

215
00:27:54,098 --> 00:27:56,532
- Want some?
- I'll pass.

216
00:28:00,018 --> 00:28:04,569
- It's been quite a day, sir.
- I want to see Kasumi in action.

217
00:28:04,658 --> 00:28:09,174
Her data is stronger than I expected.
Let's match her against Leon.

218
00:28:09,258 --> 00:28:11,931
Leon? That's harsh.

219
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:16,770
Now that she's decided to stay,
let's see how she compares to her brother.

220
00:28:16,858 --> 00:28:18,211
All right.

221
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:52,771
Before I take your life,
will you repent for leaving the clan?

222
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:56,168
My only goal is to find out
what happened to my brother.

223
00:29:00,938 --> 00:29:02,053
Leon.

224
00:29:03,898 --> 00:29:05,377
Room service.

225
00:29:17,058 --> 00:29:18,650
You want to play, little girl?

226
00:29:45,698 --> 00:29:49,407
So, according to my source,
Helena is the key.

227
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:52,056
Helena is the key?

228
00:29:54,898 --> 00:29:57,651
- I felt the earth move.
- Yeah, that's the desired effect.

229
00:29:57,738 --> 00:29:59,490
No, really, I felt the earth move.

230
00:30:14,978 --> 00:30:19,290
Come on, loosen up.
You're way too beautiful to be this tense.

231
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:23,088
Maybe a little quality time with Zack
will loosen you up.

232
00:30:51,098 --> 00:30:53,658
You couldn't have killed my brother.

233
00:30:57,698 --> 00:30:59,336
Close your eyes.

234
00:31:02,338 --> 00:31:03,896
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

235
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:07,129
- You're wearing way too much clothing.
- Hey, now.

236
00:31:08,578 --> 00:31:10,933
Come to daddy. Lay it on me.

237
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:19,890
Oh, shit!

238
00:31:22,578 --> 00:31:23,693
Tina!

239
00:31:25,698 --> 00:31:27,131
Quite a fight.

240
00:31:28,098 --> 00:31:30,692
Kasumi lives up to her brother's reputation.

241
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:32,416
One quarter final spot left.

242
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:36,454
Looks like a father-daughter
grudge match. Yeah.

243
00:31:37,298 --> 00:31:41,211
Thanks for letting me sleep here.
My room is an absolute wreck.

244
00:31:42,658 --> 00:31:44,614
Tina! It's show time!

245
00:31:45,378 --> 00:31:48,734
Dad! Not now. I'm in my underwear.

246
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:50,490
Which I hate.

247
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:53,536
Why you can't just sleep in the nude
like me, I'll never know.

248
00:31:54,298 --> 00:31:57,847
- Oh, my God.
- No. Dad, she's just another fighter.

249
00:31:57,938 --> 00:31:59,849
- We're just sleeping together.
- Yeah, I can see that.

250
00:31:59,938 --> 00:32:03,408
No, no. I mean, we're not sleeping together,

251
00:32:03,498 --> 00:32:05,170
we're just sleeping.

252
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:08,330
It seems to be like my baby girl's found
herself a special friend.

253
00:32:09,938 --> 00:32:12,736
We'll settle up tomorrow, sweetie.
Nice to meet you, miss.

254
00:32:12,818 --> 00:32:14,376
Oh, it's Christie.

255
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:16,926
- Tina's real name is Christina.
- Dad!

256
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:22,576
Thanks a lot, bitch.

257
00:32:22,658 --> 00:32:26,617
Save your strength, sweetheart.
Big day tomorrow fighting Daddy.

258
00:32:30,578 --> 00:32:32,614
Dr. Donovan, you should take a look at this.

259
00:32:32,698 --> 00:32:36,373
Have you seen this Max character?
A DOA fighter. Yeah, right.

260
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:40,212
This guy's a total fake.
We should kick him off the island.

261
00:32:40,298 --> 00:32:44,496
You're just worried this phony's
making the moves on your dream girl.

262
00:32:44,858 --> 00:32:49,409
I can have him removed from DOA island,
or I can have some fun.

263
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:52,486
- Punch up Bayman.
- Good call, sir.

264
00:32:55,658 --> 00:32:57,649
Hey, buddy, your time's up.

265
00:33:05,898 --> 00:33:08,173
You know, that was an accident. I...

266
00:33:18,658 --> 00:33:19,727
Wow.

267
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:29,729
I had the worst sleep ever last night.
Christie kept stealing all the blankets.

268
00:33:30,818 --> 00:33:32,695
You know, are you sure
this is such a good idea?

269
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:35,451
Because those things look really sharp.

270
00:33:37,258 --> 00:33:40,216
Acupuncture has many medicinal qualities.

271
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:43,529
But in a ninja's hands, it can be lethal.

272
00:33:48,978 --> 00:33:51,651
That actually feels better.

273
00:33:54,178 --> 00:33:55,327
Tina!

274
00:33:57,338 --> 00:33:58,817
Careful, baby.

275
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:02,290
Sweetie? I've come at a bad time again,
haven't I?

276
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:06,376
- Does Christie know about you two?
- Dad!

277
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:09,531
You know what?
Let's just go ahead and get this over with.

278
00:34:09,618 --> 00:34:13,896
My raft, my rules.
Whoever falls in the water first loses.

279
00:34:13,978 --> 00:34:15,457
Fair enough, Tina.

280
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:34,929
- No! Dad, you bit me!
- Sorry. Old wrestling reflex.

281
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:39,136
Dad, you have to understand.
I'm here to prove that I'm not a fake.

282
00:34:40,058 --> 00:34:42,697
Even if that means I have to hurt you.

283
00:34:52,498 --> 00:34:54,170
Nice try, sweetie.

284
00:35:08,418 --> 00:35:11,057
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.

285
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:23,693
Yes!

286
00:35:27,138 --> 00:35:28,253
Yeah!

287
00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:36,293
- That's ticklish!
- Seriously, I'm an expert...

288
00:35:36,378 --> 00:35:38,096
- Stop it.
- Trust me.

289
00:35:48,538 --> 00:35:50,210
I have a question.

290
00:35:52,098 --> 00:35:53,816
Do you do squats?

291
00:35:53,898 --> 00:35:57,174
Sorry. Just slipped right out of my hands.

292
00:35:57,258 --> 00:36:00,887
- We're playing volleyball, you want in?
- Yeah, let's play.

293
00:36:04,058 --> 00:36:06,367
If you must know, I was working.

294
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:09,256
"Working it" seemed a better description.

295
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:15,254
Helena and I take on all comers!

296
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:17,806
Hey, Kasumi, come on,
let's go kick some ass.

297
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:26,606
I just hope you're better at volleyball
than you are at seduction.

298
00:36:28,338 --> 00:36:31,535
Fifty says that Tina
gets her little ass stomped.

299
00:36:33,418 --> 00:36:38,253
You know, on second thought, why don't we
just go ahead and make it a whole dollar?

300
00:36:49,818 --> 00:36:51,968
Hayabusa, are you all right?

301
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:54,573
Yeah.

302
00:36:58,738 --> 00:37:01,047
Do you think you can manage
to keep them occupied?

303
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:04,687
I'd like to explore his lab.
Search for signs of Hayate.

304
00:37:04,778 --> 00:37:06,211
I can try.

305
00:37:09,178 --> 00:37:10,577
Hey, Kasumi, come on!

306
00:37:10,658 --> 00:37:14,936
<i>Party people gather around!</i>
<i>I hope you're enjoying the fun in the sun,</i>

307
00:37:15,018 --> 00:37:17,896
<i>but before the day is done</i>
<i>we got some hot action.</i>

308
00:37:17,978 --> 00:37:19,013
Just in time.

309
00:37:25,898 --> 00:37:30,255
<i>Now without further ado,</i>
<i>let's get this game started for all of you!</i>

310
00:37:30,338 --> 00:37:32,294
<i>DOA style! Bring it on!</i>

311
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:47,494
<i>First to five wins, folks.</i>

312
00:38:21,778 --> 00:38:23,973
<i>Oh! This action is hot!</i>

313
00:38:43,338 --> 00:38:44,453
Yeah.

314
00:38:56,218 --> 00:39:00,006
<i>Oh, Christie with a monster smash!</i>
<i>You go, girl.</i>

315
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:18,054
<i>Yes! Kasumi and Tina</i>
<i>making a comeback with that shot.</i>

316
00:39:51,578 --> 00:39:52,931
I must go.

317
00:40:16,618 --> 00:40:19,530
Ayane, I don't want to fight you!

318
00:41:02,778 --> 00:41:04,097
You are a <i>shinobi</i>.

319
00:41:04,178 --> 00:41:07,693
So was Hayate when he came here,
yet you did not pursue him.

320
00:41:08,058 --> 00:41:09,889
Hayate was different.

321
00:41:11,618 --> 00:41:13,449
Because you loved him?

322
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:28,250
Hayate is in both our hearts.
Help me find out what happened to him.

323
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:32,214
He's dead. Prepare to join him.

324
00:42:09,338 --> 00:42:12,933
Kasumi! Kasumi!

325
00:42:23,698 --> 00:42:26,292
The tattoo she has
is on her lower back, right?

326
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:31,213
Well, I've just deciphered it
and it means "Helena". Get it?

327
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:35,928
- Helena is the key. Helena must be the code.
- Max, it's brilliant.

328
00:42:37,018 --> 00:42:41,569
Except she had it done last year in Paris.
She's been showing it off to us.

329
00:43:19,778 --> 00:43:22,895
- I'm Weatherby.
- What are you doing?

330
00:43:26,498 --> 00:43:28,887
I work in the lab. I'm Weatherby.

331
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:33,246
- Helena.
- I know.

332
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:41,291
Would you like another drink?
I'll get you another drink.

333
00:43:41,378 --> 00:43:43,448
- I'll get you another drink, yeah.
- Thanks, Wellington.

334
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:46,450
Actually, it's Weatherby.
It's a pretty funny story.

335
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:49,891
My grandfather came over with his horse...

336
00:43:51,858 --> 00:43:53,530
- Hey, Wallaby!
- Yes?

337
00:43:53,618 --> 00:43:55,290
What are you doing?

338
00:43:56,498 --> 00:43:58,489
My grandfather came over...

339
00:44:00,258 --> 00:44:04,012
Hey, baby, come on, loosen up. It's a party.

340
00:44:05,738 --> 00:44:08,047
Come on, you know
you want to dance with me.

341
00:44:08,138 --> 00:44:09,491
Well, see, I'd love to.

342
00:44:09,578 --> 00:44:14,174
But I don't know how good you're gonna be
on the dance floor with two broken legs.

343
00:44:22,258 --> 00:44:25,933
So, what, you're just gonna ruin
this party for everybody?

344
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:33,688
Fine. Sunrise tomorrow morning.

345
00:44:34,618 --> 00:44:35,494
- Forbidden Square?
- Fine.

346
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,696
You wanna play?

347
00:47:02,938 --> 00:47:05,736
Boy, am I sorry I messed with you so much.

348
00:47:06,338 --> 00:47:09,648
From now on, I tell you,
my money is on you to win.

349
00:47:16,098 --> 00:47:17,770
I appreciate that.

350
00:47:19,098 --> 00:47:24,297
Our nanobots were working overtime
on that fight, but you were right about Tina.

351
00:47:24,978 --> 00:47:27,333
I have to say I did not see it coming.

352
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:31,409
That leaves a showdown
between Helena and Christie.

353
00:47:31,498 --> 00:47:34,251
And who's your favorite to win,
Mr. Weatherby?

354
00:47:34,338 --> 00:47:36,647
My money's on Helena. She rocks.

355
00:47:42,938 --> 00:47:46,089
You were right.
She does have another tattoo.

356
00:47:50,498 --> 00:47:52,011
First I want a deal.

357
00:47:52,858 --> 00:47:54,576
- Okay.
- I want half.

358
00:47:55,658 --> 00:47:58,650
And if I win, I get to keep the prize money.

359
00:48:00,338 --> 00:48:01,737
Of course.

360
00:50:24,218 --> 00:50:26,095
Let me show you something.

361
00:50:31,538 --> 00:50:32,891
Very smart.

362
00:50:36,578 --> 00:50:40,856
- The vault's in the Buddha head.
- So now we just need to find a way in.

363
00:50:45,778 --> 00:50:49,214
<i>So, it's down to the four of us.</i>
<i>But where's Hayabusa?</i>

364
00:50:50,378 --> 00:50:54,610
- I haven't seen him since yesterday.
- Well, let's go find him.

365
00:50:54,898 --> 00:50:58,777
- No. I go alone.
- Well, I'm gonna come, too.

366
00:50:58,858 --> 00:51:03,170
- I said no. He means nothing to you.
- Well, now, that's not entirely true.

367
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:06,211
- You know, he and I...
- You mean...

368
00:51:07,378 --> 00:51:10,688
Just once. He was so persistent, you know.

369
00:51:13,018 --> 00:51:14,656
I'm just kidding.

370
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:16,930
Come on, Christie.

371
00:51:21,738 --> 00:51:23,615
Second floor. Follow me.

372
00:51:24,538 --> 00:51:26,529
<i>Weatherby, take the rest of the day off.</i>

373
00:51:26,618 --> 00:51:29,655
I've got some unfinished business
to attend to.

374
00:51:38,978 --> 00:51:41,014
Holy shit!

375
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:45,808
See, when I win the money, this is exactly
the kind of office I'm gonna build.

376
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:51,848
I know you.
But why are you facing that way?

377
00:52:02,778 --> 00:52:03,813
<i>Well done.</i>

378
00:52:03,898 --> 00:52:06,093
<i>Yeah, what did you say</i>
<i>your day job was?</i>

379
00:52:17,658 --> 00:52:21,651
That's a lot of steps. My legs are on fire.

380
00:52:27,258 --> 00:52:31,251
- I guess you had a pretty rough day.
- You could say that.

381
00:52:34,338 --> 00:52:36,294
I lost to Christie.

382
00:52:37,978 --> 00:52:41,015
Yeah, I saw that. But it was a close fight.

383
00:52:43,058 --> 00:52:46,414
You almost made it to the semi-finals
of DOA, Helena.

384
00:52:47,738 --> 00:52:50,377
Your father would have been very proud.

385
00:52:51,938 --> 00:52:55,248
- Thanks, Weatherby.
- It's Weatherby, but you don't...

386
00:53:03,498 --> 00:53:04,726
Wow.

387
00:53:08,258 --> 00:53:09,930
This looks homey.

388
00:53:12,418 --> 00:53:15,888
Look at this.
They've been monitoring everything we do.

389
00:53:16,378 --> 00:53:17,891
Bunch of pervs.

390
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,652
Hayabusa.

391
00:53:42,138 --> 00:53:44,094
Hayabusa. What happened?

392
00:53:51,338 --> 00:53:52,566
Perfect.

393
00:53:54,458 --> 00:53:58,337
<i>I mean, it was amazing. Your father</i>
<i>recruited me straight out of college.</i>

394
00:53:58,418 --> 00:53:59,612
<i>I had no idea.</i>

395
00:53:59,698 --> 00:54:02,929
- That's great.
- Your father was a great man.

396
00:54:08,218 --> 00:54:11,051
Helena, there's something I should tell you.

397
00:54:13,098 --> 00:54:16,408
<i>Donovan wanted to take my research</i>
<i>into a different direction.</i>

398
00:54:16,498 --> 00:54:18,534
It's never gonna happen,
I can guarantee you.

399
00:54:18,618 --> 00:54:20,336
I did not set up DOA
for this purpose.

400
00:54:20,418 --> 00:54:22,249
I want to know what happened...

401
00:54:22,338 --> 00:54:25,375
<i>He and your father got into</i>
<i>this big argument about it.</i>

402
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:26,937
You're not gonna get away
with this, Donovan.

403
00:54:27,018 --> 00:54:30,647
<i>Your father was so against this,</i>
<i>he decided to shut down the whole thing.</i>

404
00:54:32,058 --> 00:54:34,777
- So why didn't he?
- He never got a chance to.

405
00:54:35,858 --> 00:54:37,530
He died that night.

406
00:54:49,698 --> 00:54:51,848
This is Donovan to all units.

407
00:54:51,938 --> 00:54:57,171
<i>Proceed immediately to the Great Steps</i>
<i>and eliminate Weatherby and Helena.</i>

408
00:54:57,658 --> 00:55:01,173
No one is to enter the lab complex
for the rest of the day.

409
00:55:01,258 --> 00:55:03,374
And I mean no one.

410
00:55:06,298 --> 00:55:09,415
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna go see Donovan.

411
00:55:09,498 --> 00:55:12,808
My father didn't want him to get away with it
so neither can I. Come on.

412
00:55:12,898 --> 00:55:15,366
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- Protect me.

413
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:19,133
That's funny. I was just about
to make the same suggestion.

414
00:55:34,138 --> 00:55:35,287
What the...

415
00:55:46,858 --> 00:55:48,655
I've got your back, Helena!

416
00:57:09,538 --> 00:57:11,972
That hurt. That didn't feel good.

417
00:57:12,618 --> 00:57:16,736
Whoa! Okay.
Well, I'm never gonna mess with you.

418
00:57:17,698 --> 00:57:18,847
Never?

419
00:57:20,058 --> 00:57:22,253
Well, maybe in a controlled environment.

420
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:23,817
There's gotta be
another way into the lab.

421
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,014
Well, that's where I come in.
Come on.

422
00:57:42,098 --> 00:57:43,417
Princess!

423
00:57:57,338 --> 00:57:59,613
Now that I have your attention,

424
00:58:00,258 --> 00:58:03,694
let me introduce you to the future.

425
00:58:27,178 --> 00:58:30,932
This is amazing. I can't believe
my father never told me about this.

426
00:58:31,018 --> 00:58:33,248
Well, I'm afraid that's not
the only thing you don't know.

427
00:58:33,338 --> 00:58:36,171
Donovan has taken my concept
and used it for his own ends.

428
00:58:36,258 --> 00:58:38,488
So stupid.
I should have done something earlier.

429
00:58:39,138 --> 00:58:42,528
Now it's time to harvest.

430
00:58:49,298 --> 00:58:50,287
Okay, now what?

431
00:58:50,378 --> 00:58:52,209
Donovan has begun the download.
We got to go!

432
00:58:52,298 --> 00:58:55,529
- Do you think it will really work?
- Of course! I created it!

433
01:00:01,338 --> 01:00:02,453
Look.

434
01:00:03,818 --> 01:00:05,649
- Help them.
- I'm on it. I'm on it.

435
01:00:05,738 --> 01:00:07,968
Come on. Come on.

436
01:00:08,418 --> 01:00:11,216
I've got to bypass
four security protocols to free them.

437
01:00:11,298 --> 01:00:12,447
Not easy.

438
01:00:21,338 --> 01:00:25,411
Now for the ultimate test.
The moment I've had to wait a year for.

439
01:00:26,618 --> 01:00:29,496
I've kept him in superb fighting condition.

440
01:00:30,978 --> 01:00:32,331
Send him in.

441
01:00:46,258 --> 01:00:48,613
Hayate! My brother.

442
01:01:03,698 --> 01:01:05,654
- Hayate.
- Kasumi.

443
01:01:08,018 --> 01:01:09,292
Kasumi!

444
01:01:13,618 --> 01:01:16,894
Kasumi, I was afraid
you would come looking for me.

445
01:01:19,218 --> 01:01:20,446
Hayabusa.

446
01:01:24,298 --> 01:01:26,528
How could you let this happen?

447
01:01:26,618 --> 01:01:30,657
- Your sister has the same strong will as you.
- Yes, she does.

448
01:01:31,418 --> 01:01:36,617
But she lacks that perfect blend of skills,
timing and strength

449
01:01:37,418 --> 01:01:40,569
that set you apart
as the world's greatest warrior.

450
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:44,291
You have me. Let them go.

451
01:01:47,058 --> 01:01:50,687
First things first. I challenge you to a fight.

452
01:01:51,698 --> 01:01:54,132
You win, they all go free.

453
01:01:57,058 --> 01:02:01,415
If you refuse my simple request, they die.

454
01:02:02,298 --> 01:02:03,697
Your choice.

455
01:02:15,978 --> 01:02:17,616
So be it.

456
01:03:28,298 --> 01:03:29,526
Hayate!

457
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:18,131
- No!
- Hayate!

458
01:04:31,658 --> 01:04:32,977
Ayane.

459
01:04:36,258 --> 01:04:38,214
I thought you were dead.

460
01:04:41,458 --> 01:04:43,653
I will never leave your side.

461
01:05:33,938 --> 01:05:35,769
- Come on.
- We're almost there.

462
01:05:46,418 --> 01:05:48,454
Buyers from around the world,

463
01:05:48,538 --> 01:05:51,211
I hope you've enjoyed
this live demonstration

464
01:05:51,298 --> 01:05:54,131
of the sheer power of this new technology.

465
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:57,178
Thank you for your down payments.

466
01:05:57,258 --> 01:06:01,490
Transmission to you of the download
program will begin immediately.

467
01:06:10,978 --> 01:06:13,890
- What's going on?
- Oh, no.

468
01:06:14,258 --> 01:06:16,135
- This is not good.
- What's not good?

469
01:06:16,218 --> 01:06:19,847
Donovan's transmitting the program
to buyers across the world.

470
01:06:22,418 --> 01:06:24,010
I have to stop him.

471
01:06:46,978 --> 01:06:48,127
What?

472
01:06:48,218 --> 01:06:49,173
That was close.

473
01:06:49,298 --> 01:06:51,528
Okay, time to call the cavalry.

474
01:06:52,178 --> 01:06:54,646
Donavan needs to know this is over.

475
01:07:04,098 --> 01:07:05,417
What now?

476
01:07:08,098 --> 01:07:11,374
Bayman, grab the money from the vault.
Meet me outside the lab.

477
01:07:13,058 --> 01:07:15,777
Look! He's headed this way.

478
01:07:17,338 --> 01:07:19,852
I need more time to free the others.

479
01:07:40,298 --> 01:07:42,129
Show me the money.

480
01:07:48,378 --> 01:07:51,495
Oh, no, no, listen. I can explain. Look, just...

481
01:07:58,898 --> 01:08:01,332
You're not gonna get away
with this, Donovan.

482
01:08:01,418 --> 01:08:05,934
That's exactly what your father said
right before I had him killed.

483
01:08:33,578 --> 01:08:36,376
What a shame.
You didn't download my moves.

484
01:08:36,938 --> 01:08:39,247
I think I underestimated you, Helena.

485
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:51,212
You believe the CIA will stop me?
I don't think so.

486
01:08:52,458 --> 01:08:56,087
I'll take this. All your hard work right here.

487
01:09:01,098 --> 01:09:04,613
By the time they get here,
this place will be dust.

488
01:09:07,458 --> 01:09:10,336
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>Self destruct activated.</i>

489
01:09:10,418 --> 01:09:14,616
Enjoy your life with your new girlfriend.
All three minutes of it.

490
01:09:14,698 --> 01:09:20,216
<i>Warning. Self destruct activated.</i>
<i>Please evacuate immediately.</i>

491
01:09:20,298 --> 01:09:21,413
Follow me.

492
01:09:21,498 --> 01:09:26,856
<i>Warning. Self destruct activated.</i>
<i>Please evacuate immediately.</i>

493
01:09:38,498 --> 01:09:44,050
<i>Warning. Self destruct activated.</i>
<i>Please evacuate immediately.</i>

494
01:09:47,338 --> 01:09:48,612
Take care of this.

495
01:09:57,898 --> 01:10:00,412
Come on. Follow me.
Donovan's getting away.

496
01:10:00,498 --> 01:10:02,728
<i>Please evacuate immediately.</i>

497
01:10:11,738 --> 01:10:13,490
Go! I'll handle him.

498
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:53,653
<i>Warning. Two minutes.</i>

499
01:11:17,538 --> 01:11:18,687
Oh, no.

500
01:11:25,738 --> 01:11:26,853
Come on.

501
01:12:04,058 --> 01:12:06,526
Tina! Kasumi!

502
01:12:13,698 --> 01:12:15,814
<i>Warning. Self destruct in...</i>

503
01:12:35,058 --> 01:12:37,526
Come on. We got to get out of here.

504
01:12:45,698 --> 01:12:46,892
Oh, no.

505
01:12:53,698 --> 01:12:55,928
Some thief you are!
The lab is gonna explode!

506
01:12:56,018 --> 01:12:58,407
- Forget the money!
- No, I'm not leaving the money.

507
01:12:58,498 --> 01:13:01,171
- We got to go now!
- No!

508
01:13:34,218 --> 01:13:36,209
Ten seconds! Oh, no.

509
01:13:36,898 --> 01:13:39,890
- Oh, my God. Max. The money.
- Weatherby.

510
01:13:40,178 --> 01:13:42,567
Get out of here! It's gonna blow!

511
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,693
- Come on. There's another way out.
- We gotta go now!

512
01:13:47,778 --> 01:13:49,928
- What about the money?
- Get in. It leads to the ocean.

513
01:13:50,018 --> 01:13:52,657
- Wallaby, the money. The money!
- This whole place is gonna explode!

514
01:13:52,738 --> 01:13:53,932
- Let's go!
- Come on, let's go!

515
01:13:54,018 --> 01:13:56,009
- Forget the money.
- I don't swim!

516
01:13:56,618 --> 01:13:58,017
Go! Go!

517
01:14:13,298 --> 01:14:14,651
Move!

518
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:22,530
Oh, shit!

519
01:15:04,098 --> 01:15:05,167
No.

520
01:15:13,858 --> 01:15:15,928
- Hey!
- Boys!

521
01:15:23,698 --> 01:15:28,328
- What about the money?
- Well, it was either me or the money.

522
01:15:29,138 --> 01:15:34,087
- And Wallaby chose me.
- My name is Weatherby. Weatherby.

523
01:15:40,058 --> 01:15:42,413
Oh, for God's sakes, get a room!

524
01:16:13,578 --> 01:16:16,615
Don't you think that guy
in the second row is cute?

525
01:16:16,698 --> 01:16:19,895
Is there a guy in this world
you don't have a crush on?

526
01:16:20,418 --> 01:16:24,013
You can have him,
but what about the other 300?

527
01:16:27,578 --> 01:16:29,489
Why don't we just split them up evenly?

528
01:16:30,489 --> 01:16:40,489
