00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,309
<i>- # Under the sun, under the sun #
- X! Yo, X!</i>

4
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,064
Hey, man, stop playing around.

5
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,150
For real, man.
You skating or what?

6
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:50,819
<i>- Yeah, let's go.
- Yeah.</i>

7
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:54,323
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on.

8
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,992
South Side!

9
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,662
<i>Attention, all you wallflowers...</i>

10
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,664
and all you seat warmers.

11
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,542
This is D.J. Smooth Dee talking...

12
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,128
telling you, get on the floor...

13
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:10,631
and skate till
you can't skate anymore.

14
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:15,636
'Cause after today, the Garden
will be closing its doors indefinitely.

15
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,347
And if you don't know
what "indefinitely" means...

16
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,849
<i>you shouldn't be
in here skating anyway.</i>

17
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:24,269
<i>You should have your ass
in summer school.</i>

18
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:27,523
<i>I say it with love, people.
I say it with love.</i>

19
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,108
So get up out your seat.

20
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:33,570
We'll turn this mother-sucker out.

21
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:38,575
All-skate, people.
This is an all-skate.

22
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,334
# Rock, skate #

23
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,420

34
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,090
<i># Bounce #</i>

41
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,368
<i>- Here we go. Here we go.

42
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,954
All right, fellas. Let's form
this train, y'all. Come on. Come on.

43
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,624
Whooooo!

44
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:13,337
Whoo! Whoo!

45
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,466
The boys is doing it!

46
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:20,886
<i>Them little boys is bad.</i>

47
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,308
Whoo!

48
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,519
Ooh!

49
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,273
Boy, hit my butt again
and see what happens!

50
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:36,151
Ooh! Ooh!

51
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,862
<i>- # Rock, skate #

- # Roll, bounce ##</i>

53
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:49,706
<i>Dang.
There goes our summer.</i>

54
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,502
For real. I mean, y'all,
this is jacked up.

55
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:00,717
Damn, Naps.
I know you ain't crying.

56
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,680
No. My eyes just water
like this sometimes.

57
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,932
- I have a condition.
- You ain't got no condition.

58
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,893
Only condition you need to have
is some for that hair.

59
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,567
Man, we can't keep nothing
open in the hood.

60
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,570
How much of them dumb mothers
gonna go broke all of a sudden?

61
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,656
Shoot, Negro, you'll go broke too
if you had 15 kids.

62
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,868
- Sixteen.
- Fifteen, 16, 36, whatever.

63
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,912
That Negro got a whole football
"and" a basketball team.

64
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,248
Blue 42!

65
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,127
<i>- Yeah, but I wonder what they're gonna build there.
- Come on now, X</i>

66
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,254
You know what they're
gonna build there.

67
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,090
Same thing they always build.
Either a gun shop...

68
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,134
- Barbecue shack.
- Chicken spot.

69
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,928
- Liquor store.
- Or all four in one.

70
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:49,224
<i>I hope they build that chicken spot.
Ooh, that'd be nice.</i>

71
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,769
I guess we gotta go over
to Sweetwater to skate now.

72
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,771
Mike, you're stupid.

73
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,567
Look, I'm not going all the way
over to no North Side to go skate.

74
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,487
Why not, X? You're afraid you can't
compete with those North Side boys, huh?

75
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,490
- Mm-hmm.
- Who said I was afraid?

76
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,452
Look, bottom line is
I don't wanna go over there.

77
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,206
X just doesn't wanna run into that ug mug
he took to the movies last time.

78
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:16,418
- Yep. Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Naomi? Naomi the duck.

79
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,254
- Chick's so ugly, every time you see her, you gotta duck.
- Duck!

80
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,256
Watch out. Quack.

81
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,092
Hey, I heard Sweetwater has
some nice-looking girls though.

82
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,262
- For white girls.
- So? My mom's white, Junior.

83
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,098
It's cool. She got a black woman's body,
so it don't count.

84
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,100
<i>She good.
She cool. Mm-hmm.</i>

85
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,020
No! Didn't I tell you to keep my mom's
name out your mouth? Huh?

86
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,189
Man, get back on your bike, man!

87
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,275
She's got a apple shape.
I look sometimes.

88
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,861
- Hey, I say we go up there.
- Listen, Boo, all right?

89
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:47,282
<i>I'm not... Hey!</i>

90
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,326
Look at his wheel!

91
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,621
Man, I told you to stop rolling around
on those Buster Brown Goodwill skates.

92
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,665
- Didn't I say that?
- Uh-huh. Sure, you're right.

93
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,459
For real, X, man. It's time
to chuck them bad boys.

94
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,795
Hey, my mom bought me
these skates, okay?

95
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:05,717
Your mom bought 'em for you, and we
can't even talk about your old-ass skates.

96
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:09,179
Man, Harriet Tubman wore them skates.
She skated her way to freedom.

97
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,348
# I's be skating my way to freedom #

98
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,393
- # For freedom, freedom, freedom ##
- Look, man, these are not old.

99
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,104
They're classics.

100
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,732
Yeah, you know,
like your mama's hairdo.

101
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:23,318
<i>- Whoa!
- He got you.</i>

102
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,821
She still singing
with the Supremes, right?

103
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,699
- # Bald and beautiful #
- Bald "and" beautiful.

104
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,952
<i># Bald and beautiful
Bald and beautiful ##</i>

105
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,413
Oh, snap! Later.

106
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,498
Oh, shoot. Junior, sorry.

107
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:47,551
Yes!

108
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:56,435
I made it. I made it.

109
00:07:56,518 --> 00:08:00,105
Daddy! X is late again!

110
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:03,066
Girl, shh! Oh, girl, you better
not let me catch you. Come here!

111
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,944
<i>Xavier.</i>

112
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:09,781
<i>- Huh?
- Boy, get your butt out here.</i>

113
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,410
Man, I hate her.

114
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,052
You're pushing it, son.

115
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,387
Really pushing it.

116
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,517
What, Dad?
I beat the light.

117
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,521
<i>Did I say anything
about a streetlight, Xavier?</i>

118
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:46,068
I asked you to be home early so we can get
these gutters cleaned out, didn't I?

119
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,987
<i>- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

120
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,948
Boy, this ain't
a Kool-Aid commercial.

121
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:54,076
Dad, the Gardens
closed down today for good.

122
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,745
<i>- I had to be there.
- No, son.</i>

123
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,957
You had to be here.
Okay? Here.

124
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,961
<i>Now, look,
I know it's summertime.</i>

125
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,463
You wanna be running the streets
with the Mod Squad...

126
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,007
but I'm gonna need
your help around here.

127
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,845
It's just us now, son.

128
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:18,559
<i>I'm gonna need you to step up.
You understand what I'm saying to you, son?</i>

129
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,604
Yes, sir.

130
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,588
<i>Xavier.</i>

131
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:38,555
<i>Xavier. Come on, now. Let's go.
Trash day. What? Did you forget?</i>

132
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,519
Oh, shoot! The trash!

133
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:50,359
- Ahh.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Don't try to move 'em now.

134
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,736
You know we don't like backtracking.

135
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,197
Yeah, we're highly
opposed to backtracking.

136
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:58,700
My fault. Look, I'll just bring 'em out
at night next time.

137
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:02,246
Bring 'em out at night? No, you ain't gonna
just bring 'em out at night next time.

138
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,749
What, so the German shepherd and the pit bull
puppies could snatch the bag outta there...

139
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,918
and have empty diapers
and cigarette wrappers...

140
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,421
and Snickers wrappers and Stayfree boxes
laid all out in the middle of the street?

141
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:16,218
Yeah. Then the neighbors call in
down to the plant complaining.

142
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,763
<i>- Right.
- Talking about how we didn't do our job correctly.</i>

143
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:22,766
And then we get complaints
and warnings from our boss.

144
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,977
<i>- Then after the warning comes a demerit.
- Right.</i>

145
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,565
And when you get to three demerits,
you know what happens then?

146
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,442
- A nigger lose his job!
- Oh, God, man.

147
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,612
<i>- His house! His family!
- Yeah.</i>

148
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:39,616
<i>Get kicked out of church 'cause you no
longer got money for the collection plate.</i>

149
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,244
- They want you out.
- Right.

150
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,372
<i>- All because you bringing out the garbage late.
- That's right.</i>

151
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,417
<i>And I'm telling you straight up,
man, if I lose my job, man...</i>

152
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:52,546
you're gonna put on a little Evel Knievel suit
and sell some dimes and nicks on a Big Wheel.

153
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,965
You're gonna get my money
some kinda way!

154
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:59,178
<i>Yeah. Then, 'cause of our rock-hard bodies
we developed from lifting trash...</i>

155
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,596
Right.

156
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,265
<i>- We end up in the alley as prostitutes.
- Right.</i>

157
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:04,975
Righ...

158
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,853
- Yeah, that's right! You too!
- I don't know about all that.

159
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:12,191
<i>Yeah, it could happen. You end up
in the alley with the shirt off, sweaty.</i>

160
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,359
<i>- Selling.
- Right.</i>

161
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:18,155
Not for money! Just for a bite
off the mars hamburger.

162
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:22,451
<i>The point is we trying to make: Don't mess
with the Department of Sanitation...</i>

163
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,954
or you will come up dirty!

164
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,840
Hey! Hey, hey.

165
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,804
Good God!
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

166
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,975
<i>Duncan Hines.</i>

167
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,189
<i>Mmm. Look at her.
Skin just glittering.</i>

168
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,484
Oh, yeah.

00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:59,029
Whoo! Boy!

<i>Lord have mercy.</i>

171
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:04,535
<i>Is that a Lustrasilk?
Look at how her hair blows.</i>

172
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,163
<i>Look at her.
Look at the walk.</i>

173
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,249
Chocolate city.
Chocolate city.

174
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:14,002
That must be jelly, 'cause
jam don't shake like that.

175
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:17,214
Yeah, I'm outta here.
See ya later, little man.

176
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,925
Hey, lookit here.
Why don't you check your package.

177
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:23,720
- You got a little fruit hanging out of the loom.
- Huh?

178
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:27,099
- Oh, man.
- Daddy, can we please go to McDonald's?

179
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,936
No, honey. It's too early now.
I gotta go to work. Come...

180
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:37,109
- Where are your clothes?
- Um, Dad...

181
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:41,572
Never mind. I'm taking your sister to Pam's
house to play, and then I gotta go to work.

182
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,285
Dad, shouldn't you comb her hair first?

183
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:50,372
I did comb it.

184
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,375
Looks good.

185
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:56,295
<i>In the car, honey.</i>

186
00:13:56,378 --> 00:14:00,174
Anyway, I'm outta here.
Don't burn down my house.

187
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:04,720
And put some clothes on, boy. This ain't
Africa. What's the matter with you?

188
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:11,143
Hey, Curt! What's up, baby?
Mr. Astronomical Man!

189
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,228
Hey, Byron, Victor.

190
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,148
Boy, you know I wanna be
just like you when I grow up.

191
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,568
Wear the jeans with the whole sweater
tucked down in the pants.

192
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,403
Oh, boy.

193
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,990
No, man, all jokes aside, man, how the
airplane engineering business treating you?

194
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,117
Never better, brother.
Never better.

195
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:30,037
"Never better, brother.
Never better. "

196
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,748
Cool it, man.
Curtis Uncle Tom, man.

197
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,084
Damn! So what you think about me,
man, if you think he's Uncle Tom?

198
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,128
He ain't down with the struggle
like you and me.

199
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,130
<i>- That dude voted for Nixon.
- You're right about that.</i>

200
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,385
Can I take a message?

201
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:48,764
Sure. You can try back in about an hour.
All right. Thank you.

202
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,807
Yes. Good morning. Hi.

203
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,977
Good morning. I'm Curtis Smith. I'm here
to apply for the engineering position.

204
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:57,481
I'm sorry, but that position
has already been filled. Sorry.

205
00:14:57,523 --> 00:15:01,610
<i>- Good morning. McGill and White.
How may I help you?</i>

206
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:09,243

207
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:15,624
Hey! How you doing? All right.

208
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,125
Ahh!

209
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,004
Whoo!

210
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:24,508
Hey, man!

211
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,344
Hey, how you doing,
Mr. Johnson? All right.

212
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:31,014
What the... Boy, what you doing?

213
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,150
All right, here he comes.
Arm yourselves.

214
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,369
Oh!

215
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:56,373
Hey! Hey, come on, man! Stop it!

216
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,334
Stop playing!

217
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,013
Get him!

218
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:16,518
Little punks!

219
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:24,067
Oh, sh...

220
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:28,071
Whew.

221
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:39,541
It's 97 degrees on the South Side.

222
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,877
Hey, Mr. Walker.

223
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:57,142
- Hi.
- Hi.

224
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,855
- Whoa!
- Oh!

225
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:04,233
- Oh, shoot!
- Oh, man.

226
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,568
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

227
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,695
- All right. I just wanted to...
- Yeah, I'm cool.

228
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,781
- I wanted to make sure.
- Just breaking in some skates.

229
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:14,576
Tori. My mom and I
just moved in over there.

230
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,912
Oh, okay. I'm X.

231
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:20,415
Oh, okay. I think I seen your mom
take out the trash last week.

232
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:24,962
Mm, black woman, skintight jeans,
wearing a top with no bra on?

233
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,507
- Uh, look, I don't...
- Yeah, that was her.

234
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,426
She know she be working it.

235
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:35,430
So, man, I see you skating.
Um, you a skater?

236
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:39,101
Yeah, I... My daddy sent these for me.

237
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:42,104
He lives in Atlanta
with his new wife... a white woman.

238
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:45,691
But I ain't mad. Shoot, she's rich.

239
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:48,235
What about you?

240
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,946
<i>Do you have any brothers or sisters?</i>

241
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:54,157
Well, yeah, I have a little sister.
She's five going on 40.

242
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,785
<i>And then there's my dad.</i>

243
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:59,413
Well, no comment.

244
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,791
What about the people here?

245
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,170
<i>- What about 'em?
- You know. They all nice like you?</i>

246
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:09,631
Yeah, of course.
I mean, this is a nice city.

247
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,676
<i>- They're all nice like me.
- Oh, really?</i>

248
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,345
<i>Yeah. Better yet,
I'm gonna prove it to you.</i>

249
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:18,140
- Hey, guys, this is Tori.
- Hi.

250
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:21,018
Damn!

251
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,021
Dang, girl! Did a whole silverware drawer
explode in your mouth?

252
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:30,360
I'm just saying, Amtrak called. They said
they need some of their tracks back.

253
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:34,239
Lay me some tracks. Come on.

254
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:37,493
Look, don't trip on him, all right?
He's always like this.

255
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,912
Oh, don't worry. I'm not.

256
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:42,956
I know punk rides
on the short yellow bus.

257
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,918
- Ooh!
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

258
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,879
Heavy metal? I know
you don't wanna start.

259
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,715
- Yeah, you don't wanna start.
- Because I ain't the one.

260
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,426
- He ain't the one.
- See, look at you.

261
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,263
Your mouth look like a daggone
tin foil factory! That's what it look like.

262
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:02,684
<i>Well, at least I'm getting my teeth corrected.</i>

263
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,937
<i>- Look at yours.
- What?</i>

264
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,482
You need to stop chewing
on them yellow crayons...

265
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,235
<i>and start scrubbing with
some Colgate, yuck mouth.</i>

266
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,112
She called you yuck mouth!

267
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:17,616
What?

268
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,452
See, that ain't fair.
You can't say "yuck mouth. "

269
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:23,497
Because I'm allergic
to toothpaste anyway.

270
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,707
And I was eating Cheetos.

271
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,876
Look, look, forget you.
All right? I got you.

272
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,295
I got something for you.
Why you laugh at that, man?

273
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:33,298
<i>- 'Cause it's funny, yuck mouth.
- Yo, X</i>

274
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:37,427
We're going over to Sweetwater to check it out
and maybe even get a glimpse at Sweetness.

275
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:41,431
- What's a Sweetness? - Only the baddest
mo-fo to ever slap on a pair of skates.

276
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,559
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, best on the North Side.

277
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,602
- I mean, not over here.
- Man, whatever.

278
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:48,689
He wins the skate-off
every year. Dude is good.

279
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:52,150
<i>Hey, I heard he had his own
"theme music, like on" Baretta.</i>

280
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,778
- He ain't got no theme music.
- And I heard that one time...

281
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:57,781
some fool challenged Sweetness
in the middle of the rink to a skate-off.

282
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:00,784
He made homeboy look so bad
that he went number two on himself.

283
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:02,828
- Stop jiving, man. You're lying.
- Man, I swear.

284
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,455
Number two in white jeans.
He boo-booed on himself.

285
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,583
<i>- Nasty.
- "So, X, man, you coming or what?</i>

286
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:10,961
Guys, how come we just can't skate
over here like we been doing?

287
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,547
X, stop being a little punk, man.

288
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,758
Look, we'll have you home
before the streetlight come on, all right?

289
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,802
- Yeah.
- Look, my boy's coming.

290
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:21,263
Cool. I'm coming too.

291
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,432
Oh, he-he-hell, no.

292
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,767
Junior, man, come on!

293
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:29,313
- Can you even skate?
- Yeah.

294
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:32,941
Yeah? Just don't fall on your face.
It's already hurt enough.

295
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:35,986
Boy, don't touch my face.

296
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:39,907
Hey, y'all, be quiet. Shh.
A moment of silence for her face, please.

297
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,284
All right. Amen.
Hallelujah. Let's go.

298
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,370
<i>That's messed up, yuck mouth.</i>

299
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:58,509
Let's do this.

300
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,428
- Oh, I'm telling you!
- Hey, man, we're gonna have a good time at Sweetwater.

301
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:04,848
I promise, man. Look at this.
My goodness! Whoo!

302
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:14,358
<i>Hey, see that right there? They got video games.</i>

303
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:30,541
Can I get your name?
Excuse me! Your number?

304
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:33,418
Dang, this place is live.
I could live up in here.

305
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,420
- Me too.
- For real.

306
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:38,924
I didn't expect all of... this.

307
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,260
<i>What was that?</i>

308
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,595
- I don't know.
- Was that a girl or a guy?

309
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,932
- Why you do that?
- Hey, man, this place has everything.

310
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,852
- Yeah.
- Yeah, everything...

311
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,979
but some real music.

312
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,273
Okay, I mean,
the Gardens used to bump.

313
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:58,026
<i>- Yeah, that's true.
- What? Boy, this is a jam.</i>

314
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,362
# In the words of a broken heart #

315
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:04,825
# It's just emotion
that's taken me over #

316
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:07,744
- She's crazy.
- #Tied up in sorrow #

317
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,746
"Emotion" by the Bee Gees!

318
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,249
The Bee whats?

319
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:15,210
Come on! Y'all never
heard of the Bee Gees?

320
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:18,630
No. But it sound like something
my cousin caught from his girlfriend.

321
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:20,632
I heard it make your balls fall off.

322
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:22,634
- Fo... For real?
- Yeah, so watch out.

323
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:25,554
- Yo! Check this out!
- What?

324
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:30,100
Whoo! Ha! Now this
is what I'm talking about.

325
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:33,770
"Come compete

328
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:41,236
You know what I could buy with $500?

329
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,115
Hopefully a comb, Naps.

330
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:48,911
Well, guys, I'm good.
I've seen enough.

331
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:52,206

- X, we just got here, man. What are you talking about?

332
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,666

Why are you acting all funky?</i>

333
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,085
<i>- Man, I'm not acting all funky.
- You are too.</i>

334
00:22:57,127 --> 00:23:00,255
Plus there's way too much new booty
for us to be jaw-jacking with you.

335
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:03,217
- For real. I'm renting skates.
- I'm with you, Naps.

<i>- Come on. Come on.

- Right, nine. Right.

00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:42,297
No, man. These are 12's.
I asked for nines.

00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,217
Oh, my fault, little man.

348
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,640
Well? Could you go get 'em?

349
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:54,893
Hey, man, I can't be wearing
these big old boats.

350

- Check this out, young blood.

You're gonna wear whatever

Dig that?

353

Don't start nothing.
Won't be nothing.

Hey, baby.

00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:25,734
- Hi, Xavier.
- What?

365

- Naomi?
- Yes.

366
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,114
How are you?

367
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:33,992
Oh, I-I'm fine.

368
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:36,495
<i>- So when did you start coming here?
- Is that the duck?</i>

369

<i>- Oh, well, this is the first time down here.
- Damn!</i>

370
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:42,125
See, the Gardens
got closed down, so...

371
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:45,003
They closed the Gardens?
I didn't know that.

372
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:47,464
<i>Hmm.</i>

373
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:49,967

Um, are these your friends?

Yeah. Uh, this is Mike,
Boo, Junior, Naps...

376
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:59,101

377
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,478
- Hi.
- Can't call it. Can't call it.

378
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:04,356
- Hi. How's it...
- Shh.

379
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,358
- What?
- You're messing it up!

380
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:09,778
Those lips hit my neck.

381
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,699
You look great.

382
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:15,617
Yeah, so do you.

383
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:18,662
He ain't lying.
He ain't lying.

384
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,623
So I'll have to tell my mom
that I ran into you.

385
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:23,625
Oh, okay.

386
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,838
Come here.

387
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:31,842
Um, I never had a chance to tell you...

388
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:35,179
but I'm really sorry about your mom.

389
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:38,056
Oh, it's fine. Really.

390
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,808
- What she say?
- Shh, shh.

391
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,810
She said something
about a ham sandwich.

392
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:44,855
<i>No, I know, but I just wanted you
to know that I am sorry.</i>

393
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:47,149
Naomi, really, it...

394
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:49,151
Would you look at that?
Five hundred!

395
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:52,571

- Hold yourself together, Tori.
- Cape.

407
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:34,006

Sweetness got the honeys.

418
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:35,442
I think Tootsie is scoping me.
Here, Tootsie, Tootsie, Tootsie!

419
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:38,195
Man, I hope she don't
got the Bee Gees.

420

I guess everybody loves
Sweetness around here, huh?

421
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:42,825
Not everybody.

I thought we were cool. Hey, what's up
with that fake number you gave me?

426
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,512
Yeah, what's up with the fake digits?

427
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:06,515
It wasn't fake.
They just weren't mine.

428
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:10,102
Okay. Okay.

429
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:14,398
I see how it is. Okay, so you won't give
me... me... your number?

430
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:17,067
Instead you give it to a raggedy dude
with a crooked-ass 'fro.

431
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,444
Yeah.

00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,681
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

454
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:32,935
I don't know, man. Hey, look, let's
show these dudes how we do it on the...

455
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:35,103
South Side!

456
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:38,440
<i>- Can I come too? 'Cause I...
- No.</i>

457
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:40,484
<i>Hell, no.</i>

458
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:44,655
I didn't want to skate
with them anyway. Aah!

459
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:05,676
Yeah!

460
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:30,159
Oh, shoot! Come on, Junior.
Come on, Boo.

461
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,579
Dang, y'all!

462
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:36,832
I said size nine! Size nine!

463
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:42,004
- Dang, they're too far ahead.
- All right, X man. Cut through the middle.

464
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:44,673
- Come on. Come on, y'all.
- Hell, yeah.

465
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:47,843
Come on, y'all.
We gotta catch up.

466
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:50,762
<i>- Man, that Chinese boy's fast.
- Let's get the train together.</i>

467
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:03,358
Watch out!

468
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,595
<i>Y'all go on.
You're all weak anyways.</i>

469
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:33,597
- Uh-huh.
- A bunch of suckers.

470
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:42,981
- Yo, they was doing moves I never even seen before.
- Whatever.

471
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:44,983
<i>[X
Yeah, they were pretty good.</i>

472
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:48,737
<i>- Whatever, man. It's home court advantage. Don't even count.
- Whatever, Junior.</i>

473
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:51,740
- I'm about to go to the snack bar and get an Icee or something.
- I'm with you, man.

474
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:54,201
- Boo, you okay?
- Man, my eye's acting up.

475
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:56,286
Man, I'm renting new skates.

476
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,206
- I'm... I'm gonna go sit down.
- Y'all go on.

477
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,584
I'm about to get me some ofTootsie.

478
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:05,337
<i>Here, Tootsie, Tootsie, Tootsie.</i>

479
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,882
That thing that you're doing...
kind of like a twist, like you're jumping...

480
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:11,802
- and then kind of like...
- Tori, Tori, please, okay?

481
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:13,804
- I'm telling you...
- Please!

482
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:23,605
Gotcha!

483
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:29,111
Oh!

484
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:34,116
Oh, damn. Junior!

485
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:42,958
- He's got a woody!
- Shut up! Shut up!

486
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:45,335
<i>My baby's big.</i>

487
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:47,796
<i>Damn.</i>

488
00:34:55,512 --> 00:35:00,767
Shut up! Shut up! First of all, they're
support briefs, and all the athletes wear 'em.

489
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:04,188
Wilt Chamberlain,
Kareem Abdul-Jabaar, O.J. Simpson.

490
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:06,190
They said they make you run faster.

491
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:08,025
All the ones that wear bras!

492
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:10,110
Shut up!

493
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:13,363
- I'll show you something big!
- Hey, man, this ain't funny!

494
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:17,326
This is not no joke. These dudes
don't even respect us.

495
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:20,662
They just chalk us up to be some poor
ghetto boys from the South Side...

496
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:23,165
<i>that don't even have a pot to piss in.</i>

497
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:25,250
And that's not even us.

498
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:30,172
We're them boys used to go down
to the Gardens to skate our asses off.

499
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:34,510
Now, I know I was the one
against going over there...

500
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:39,056
but now, fellas, we gotta go there.

501
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,517
Get back on top, no matter what.

502
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:47,898
We need to kick ass
at this skate-off come August.

503
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:59,368
<i>- I see somebody got their balls off layaway.
- Yeah, whatever.</i>

504
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:01,370
You just stop wearing purple panties...

505
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:03,455
and start putting lotion
on your ashy butt.

506
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:05,874
Hey, where we from, y'all?

507
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:08,210
South Side!

508
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:12,631
Hey, there's a homey right there!

509
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:34,820
What?

510
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:44,329
Bad dream?

511
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:48,834
All right. Come on.

512
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:04,391
<i>- Xavier?
- Go to sleep.</i>

513
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:07,019
<i>What was Mom like?</i>

514
00:37:13,317 --> 00:37:15,444
Huh?

515
00:37:15,486 --> 00:37:20,073
Tell me what she was like again.

516
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:25,913
Well...

517
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:31,210
she was a lot like you.

518
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:37,174
She was... She was always fantasizing
like she was somebody else.

519
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:41,595
Diana Ross, Tina Turner.

520
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,059
But she couldn't sing though.

521
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:50,145
- No?
- No, not a lick.

522
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:55,567
See, me and Dad didn't have
the heart to tell her...

523
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:57,820
so we would just
sit back on the couch...

524
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:00,113
and she'd just let it rip.

525
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,661
Yeah, Mom was so pretty.

526
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:10,165
Dad would always tell me...

527
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:14,211
"Son, God must really like us. "

528
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:20,884
Back then you couldn't
keep Dad from smiling.

529
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:22,886
But when he looks at you...

530
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:26,473
he gets that same grin on his face...

531
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:29,518
just like when he used to look at Mom.

532
00:38:38,527 --> 00:38:41,697
Mom was like an angel.

533
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,116
A black angel?

534
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:51,165
Yeah, I guess so.

535
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:21,653
<i>Have a good time, son. Make sure
you hold your sister's hand.</i>

536
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:24,948
- And spend all his money, honey.
- Nice meeting you, Mr. Smith.

537
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:27,784
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

538
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:32,581
<i>Oh, baby, I love you.</i>

539
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:35,417
<i>- Yes, you do.
- I love you.</i>

540
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,753
<i>And I love you back.</i>

541
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:40,255
I gotcha.

542
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:45,344
Size 12!

543
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:48,055
<i>What it is.</i>

544
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:50,599
<i>So?</i>

545
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:53,435
<i>You know, the ladies,
they can't get enough of Bernard.</i>

546
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:58,357
I think it's the lips. You know,
not too pouty, not too brave.

547
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,609
You know, firm and tender like sirloin.

548
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:03,111
<i>I used to do lip exercises on my pillow.</i>

549
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:05,489
And a-one and two...

550
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:08,659
Can I get a size nine, please!

551
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:13,163
Now. Today. "Ahora. "

552
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:16,750
All right, 'fro magnum.

553
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,794
Dude, calm down.

554
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:21,338
Trying to bond with a brother, man.
That's all.

555
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:23,340
You ain't trying to bond with me.

556
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:27,511
You done gave me my skates a long
time ago, I wouldn't have to be waiting.

557
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:31,723
Dude, these are size 15's!

558
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:35,018
Man, why you keep doing me like this?

559
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:38,397
Check this out.
The ladies around here...

560
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,735
like a brother with a big... skate.

561
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:59,251
You got a size 17
back there, Bernard?

562
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:02,045
Size 17 back there, Bernard?

563
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:04,756
Talking my talk now.
Let me get you the...

564
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:12,014
Bye, X.

565
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:15,601
I told you I didn't want to bring her.

566
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:18,437
Oh, she don't wanna be with you.
She's going over there.

567
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,356
<i>Look who it is.</i>

568
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:24,776
'Sup, X? And how'd you get in, Jaws?

569
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,237
I see the metal detector
must be broken.

570
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:29,239
I don't know.

571
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:32,284
Ask your big-boned mama.
She the one working the door.

572
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:35,913
<i>She got you again, Junior.</i>

573
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:38,123
- You two need to quit, okay?
- Oh, don't talk to me.

574
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:40,918
Talk to him.

575
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:42,920
Stupid.

576
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:51,261
<i>Oh, no, man. There go them dude
in them tights again. He look fruity.</i>

577
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:54,056
<i>- What is wrong with him?
- Whatever. Hey, yo, X, lace up.</i>

578
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:56,808
I was watching "Kung Fu Theater. "
I know this move we could use.

579
00:41:56,892 --> 00:41:59,561
- All right.
- All right. Yo. Hey.

580
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:04,817
Man, your friends are so stupid.

581
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,653
Hey, you're just now figuring that out?

582
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:09,696
I know. Right.

583
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,698
<i>Session two is now beginning.</i>

584
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:14,451
<i>This next skate
will be for couples only.</i>

585
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:16,829
<i>This is a couples' skate.</i>

586
00:42:16,912 --> 00:42:18,831
<i>- Oh, look, look, look.
- What? What?</i>

587
00:42:18,914 --> 00:42:20,916
There goes your other friend.

588
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:25,420
- Hi.
- Hey.

589
00:42:25,504 --> 00:42:28,257
- Hey, X.
- Hi.

590
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:31,635
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

591
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:40,102
So, how's everything going?

592
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:43,522
Everything's cool. Cool.

593
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:46,275
And real cool.

594
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:49,653
<i>So?</i>

595
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:52,698
So?

596
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:55,659
So?

597
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:59,830
Isn't this couples' skate?
You two should go skate.

598
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:01,832
I don't mind.

599
00:43:01,915 --> 00:43:04,418
Thank you. I mean...

600
00:43:09,882 --> 00:43:13,427
Hey, I remember those.
You've had those for a long time.

601
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:15,971
Your mom gave 'em to you
on your 13th birthday, right?

602
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:20,893
Right.

603
00:43:22,978 --> 00:43:27,316
So, you wanna go
get out there together?

604
00:43:29,193 --> 00:43:31,653
Uh, I can't.

605
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:35,657
I ate something today...

606
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:37,993
and my stomach is acting up,
and I don't think...

607
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:42,498
It's okay. It's okay.
Maybe another time.

608
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:46,084
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

609
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:50,047
What a doof!

610
00:43:56,345 --> 00:43:59,890
What's happening?

611
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:06,021
Hello?

612
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:08,440
Come on. Come on. Come on.

613
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:13,654
<i>Hello?</i>

614
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:15,906
Hello.

615
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:18,283
I'm Vivian. Vivian Turner,
your new neighbor.

616
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:20,869
Oh. Hi. I'm Curtis.

617
00:44:20,953 --> 00:44:24,581
Uh, yeah. I just got home from work,
and I got this note from my daughter...

618
00:44:24,665 --> 00:44:27,376
saying she went skating with an... an X?

619
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:33,340
Yes. Um, X is my son, Xavier.

620
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:35,884
I dropped 'em off
a little while ago at the rink.

621
00:44:35,968 --> 00:44:38,262
Okay. Well, is this
a once-in-a-while thing...

622
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:41,723
or do you make a practice of dropping off
people's kids that you don't even know?

623
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:44,059
<i>- Hey, what...
- 'Cause if it is...</i>

624
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:47,938
then maybe the authorities
should be notified about your activities.

625
00:44:48,021 --> 00:44:52,234
- Look, Mrs. Turner...
- Miss Turner.

626
00:44:52,276 --> 00:44:57,239
Oh, it's miss. Okay, Miss Lady
With A Bad Attitude, whatever...

627
00:44:57,281 --> 00:45:02,035
Calm down, okay? The kids
were gonna ride the bus to the rink.

628
00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:03,871
But, you know, being
the neglectful parent that I am...

629
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:06,123
I decided to give 'em a ride anyway.

630
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:09,418
Now, since you're so concerned
about your daughter's welfare...

631
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:11,420
I suggest you take a ride up to the rink.

632
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:14,423
It's about 30 minutes up Imperial.
They close at midnight.

633
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:16,800
However, my son will be here at 8:00.

634
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:20,429
So you can either wait...
but, you know, in your garage...

635
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:24,600
or you can go down there and be known
as the party-crashing mama on the block...

636
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:27,644
and give your daughter a serious complex
for the rest of her natural-born life.

637
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:30,022
<i>Your choice.</i>

638
00:45:33,775 --> 00:45:37,112
- Your carburetor's flooded.
- So is yours.

639
00:45:37,154 --> 00:45:39,114
<i>Big old Fat Albert look-alike.</i>

640
00:45:39,156 --> 00:45:41,241
<i>Must be crazy talking to me like...</i>

641
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:44,286
How do you know
the carburetor's flooded?

642
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:47,664
You need to put
some lotion on them feet.

643
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:54,796
Man, this is Bruce Lee's "Fists of Fury. "

644
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:57,216
Ain't nobody doing this in the competition.

645
00:45:57,299 --> 00:45:59,676
I wonder why, Junior.

646
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:03,889
Ah, now what?

647
00:46:03,972 --> 00:46:09,520
<i>And here he is,
center floor, Sweetwater's finest.</i>

648
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:12,606
<i>Give it up for Sweetness.</i>

649
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:44,096
Go Sweetness! Go Sweetness!
Go Sweetness! Go Sweetness!

650
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:47,641
Go Sweetness! Go Sweetness!
Go Sweetness!

651
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:51,019
Go Sweetness! Go Sweetness!

652
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:45,407
<i>I- I don't know, y'all. I mean, he's good.</i>

653
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:47,576
- Told you.
- He's okay.

654
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:50,078
But I've seen X do all those moves.

655
00:48:01,924 --> 00:48:04,676
<i>Oh, oh, oh, hell, no.</i>

656
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,720
- Ohhh.
- Except that one.

657
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:08,889
Now, that was good.
I'll give that a 10.

658
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,771
Hey, Poindexter, get off me.

659
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:19,024
Get off of me, man!
You okay?

660
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:22,778
<i>Somebody fan her for me.</i>

661
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:38,126
Yeah.

662
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:49,847
Hey, I didn't know you were here.

663
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,140
Didn't see the Mustang out front.

664
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:55,227
Oh, um, yeah.

665
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:59,148
It's been, uh, giving me a little trouble,
so I put it in the shop.

666
00:48:59,189 --> 00:49:01,066
Hmm.

667
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:04,570
Hey, Dad, where you going?

668
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:08,157
Oh, just over to Miss Jenkins's house.

669
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,159
She having a little get-together.

670
00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:12,703
She kinda cornered me
in the frozen food section today...

671
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:15,164
so, you know,
I have to show my face.

672
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,627
Are there gonna be women there?

673
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:28,552
<i>It's just that I've never seen you
get all dressed up like this before.</i>

674
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:33,223
Wearing cologne.

675
00:49:33,307 --> 00:49:38,020
Son, it's just a party.

676
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:40,647
Oh, no, no, no.
It's cool. It's cool.

677
00:49:40,731 --> 00:49:42,691
- Oh, it's cool?
- It's cool.

678
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:46,695
- Take your time. Your time.
- Thank you so much.

679
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:52,659
- So, how was Sweetwater?
- Oh, it was good.

680
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:56,371
See, Dad, we're going against this guy named
Sweetness and his crew at the skate-off.

681
00:49:56,455 --> 00:49:59,166
- Think you'll make it?
- I don't know, son.

682
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:02,753
I may have to work.

683
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:04,922
Oh.

684
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:07,382
<i>You know, to be honest, son...</i>

685
00:50:07,466 --> 00:50:10,719
you could be doing something more constructive
than wasting time at that skating rink.

686
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:17,226
Mom didn't think it was a waste of time.

687
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:25,734
<i>- Daddy.
- Hey, pretty girl. Come on. Come on.</i>

688
00:50:25,818 --> 00:50:28,946
Oh, boy, you're getting
so big, baby. Oh, man.

689
00:50:29,029 --> 00:50:31,782
- You smell good, Daddy.
- Oh, thank you, baby.

690
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:34,243
<i>Can you read me a story?</i>

691
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:37,329
<i>Mmm, yeah, I can read you a story.</i>

692
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:39,665
<i>Man, you've got to be crazy.</i>

693
00:50:39,748 --> 00:50:43,043
You ain't got to be from Ohio
to be one in Ohio, player.

694
00:50:43,085 --> 00:50:45,087
This Tino glamour, baby.

695
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,506
- Hey, Rhonda, what's going on?
- Hi, Tino.

696
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:49,508
- Nothing much.
- How you doing?

697
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:53,220
- Good.
- How'd you get these napkins to match that outfit, mama?

698
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:55,889
- You know, you do your thing right here.
- I gotta do my thing.

699
00:50:55,973 --> 00:50:58,350
<i>- Get off my phone.
- All right, my heart. Hold on.</i>

700
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:02,020
<i>It ain't long distance.
You know what I'm saying.</i>

701
00:51:02,104 --> 00:51:04,940
<i>I thought I'd bring you a drink.</i>

702
00:51:05,023 --> 00:51:08,443
Oh, um, thanks, Rhonda,
but I don't drink.

703
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:11,321
You don't drink? What,
you a Jehovah Witness or something?

704
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:14,783
- No, I'm just not a drinker. That's all.
- Mm.

705
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:19,204
- But, hey, I do like all this, uh, cheetah thing you got going.
- Cheetah?

706
00:51:19,288 --> 00:51:23,041
It's leopard.
Cheetah's too gaudy.

707
00:51:24,126 --> 00:51:26,295
Huh.

708
00:51:26,378 --> 00:51:29,089
Well, I'll get you a Pepsi.

709
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:32,718
- Okay.
- You keep that wall up for me.

710
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:37,764
Ooh, Curtis, my man!
Curtis, my man!

711
00:51:37,848 --> 00:51:41,518
Big Curtis! I didn't know
you was on Rhonda.

712
00:51:41,602 --> 00:51:45,564
<i>What? No, man. I'm just...
I ain't on nothing but this wall.</i>

713
00:51:45,647 --> 00:51:48,817
- Okay? Just the wall.
- Man, if I wasn't miserably married, man...

714
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:51,945
I'd be trying to tame
that big wild kingdom.

715
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:54,740
Whole lot of rumbling engine.

716
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:57,034
And she make a damn good rib.

717
00:51:57,117 --> 00:52:00,204
I'll handle that cat.

718
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:02,456
Beat that cat down.

719
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:06,210
Let me get a piece of that rib.

720
00:52:06,293 --> 00:52:08,295
Hey, man, don't touch my rib.

721
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:11,590
Rhonda, you ain't slick.
We saw you over there working Curtis.

722
00:52:11,673 --> 00:52:15,093
What? Okay. Girl, please. I wasn't doing
nothing but getting that man a Pepsi.

723
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:17,095
- That's all.
- Mm-hmm.

724
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:19,640
- But he is fine.
- Girl, yes, he is!

725
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:24,061
Oh, I just feel so sorry
about what happened to Kathy.

726
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:26,104
- Yeah, I know.
- Oh, yeah.

727
00:52:26,188 --> 00:52:28,649
- That was a beautiful woman.
- Yes, she was.

728
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:30,692
<i>- She was.
- Now, who's Kathy?</i>

729
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:32,820
<i>- Oh, that's right. You don't know, do you?
- Mm-mm.</i>

730
00:52:32,903 --> 00:52:34,988
- Kathy was his wife.
- Oh.

731
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,866
<i>She died last year... What was that...
two weeks or so before Christmas?</i>

732
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:41,286
<i>- Oh.
- Turns out she had some sort of a heart condition.</i>

733
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:44,581
- It was sad. I feel bad for those kids.
- Mm, baby. Really sad.

734
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:47,334
<i>- Oh.
- Yeah, it is.</i>

735
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:51,213
<i>In the meantime,
I'm gonna get him that Pepsi.</i>

736
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:53,298
Girl.

737
00:52:53,382 --> 00:52:55,592
That's a cute outfit, girl.

738
00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:00,848
You need to work on your aim.

739
00:53:00,931 --> 00:53:02,975
- Ah, they'll find it.
- Ohhh!

740
00:53:03,058 --> 00:53:04,977
Maybe they'll start
paying me on time.

741
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,980
Hey, what's up with you
and that Naomi girl?

742
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:10,107
You guys used to date?

743
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:13,819
<i>No, we were just friends.</i>

744
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:16,405
<i>- You should like her.
- Huh?</i>

745
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:19,032
You heard me.
She's a cute girl.

746
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:21,785
What's not to like?
I see you checking her out.

747
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:24,830
Drooling, mouth all open.
But you ain't gotta be ashamed.

748
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:27,040
You know, I was gonna
tell you, though...

749
00:53:27,082 --> 00:53:29,376
when you're with a girl,
you gotta be cool, okay?

750
00:53:29,418 --> 00:53:32,880
You can't be no nerd letting her see you dribble,
because that you should be ashamed of.

751
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:37,009
- Your daddy should've told you this, but anyway...
- Tori.

752
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:39,011
Throw a paper.

753
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,646
All right, we got a live one.
Are we ready?

754
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,648
We're ready.

755
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:02,951
Tori!

756
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:06,747
Hey, X! Hey!

757
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:17,883
Ah! Ah, ah! Oh!

758
00:54:21,803 --> 00:54:24,306
Tori!

759
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:29,394
No!

760
00:54:33,273 --> 00:54:35,943
Man, no! Get outta here,
you little punks!

761
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:40,322
Tori, you all right?

762
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:47,996
Shut up. Just shut up.

763
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,417
<i>Got you.</i>

764
00:54:54,837 --> 00:54:57,631
We got three weeks till the skate-off.

765
00:54:57,673 --> 00:54:59,758
We need to step it up.

766
00:54:59,842 --> 00:55:04,388
Last week at Sweetwater...
I ain't gonna name no names, Naps...

767
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:06,557
- What?
- But last week at Sweetwater...

768
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,934
some of us looked like crap.

769
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:11,228
What?

770
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:14,356
I'm gonna be ready.
I'm clutch.

771
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:18,152
No, what you need to do
is clutch some skating skills, clown.

772
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:22,030
Yeah, stop renting skates. Why don't you
just wear the ones that you have on?

773
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:25,701
Dude, what do I look like
rolling in my sister's skates?

774
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:28,829
<i>No different.
You still look goofy.</i>

775
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:32,374
<i>- Forget you, Mike, albino punk.
- Whatever, Ricky Ricardo.</i>

776
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:35,752
Hurry up! "What's Happening"
comes on at 4:00.

777
00:55:35,836 --> 00:55:38,797
<i>Mind your business, chain saw lips.</i>

778
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:42,009
Naps, take the box.
Get in formation.
