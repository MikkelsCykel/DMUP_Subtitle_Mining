1
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:04,623
Oh, Father.

2
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:17,423
Father Merrin, in the valley
of the shadow of death. . .

3
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,975
. . .be at my side.

4
00:03:00,786 --> 00:03:03,095
Why me?

5
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:06,099
l heal the sick.

6
00:03:06,306 --> 00:03:08,536
Why me?

7
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:58,584
Okay, 8:00 tomorrow.

8
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:42,177
Debbie.

9
00:04:42,946 --> 00:04:45,221
Debbie, can you hear it?

10
00:04:45,426 --> 00:04:47,064
No?

11
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:49,575
l'll turn it up.

12
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:53,582
Debbie, Debbie.

13
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,377
You can hear it?

14
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:08,380
Mother's late. She's never on time.

15
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:11,259
-Hi.
-Hi, Regan! You're right on time.

16
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:13,582
-For once.
-Yeah.

17
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:48,177
What's happening?

18
00:05:48,586 --> 00:05:50,577
Not much.

19
00:05:50,986 --> 00:05:54,183
-Any dreams?
-No dreams.

20
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:56,183
Okay.

21
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:04,541
-Look, l'm just wasting your time.
-Why do you say that?

22
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:09,024
-Well, you know why l come here.
-Well, you tell me.

23
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:13,937
-To make my mom feel better.
-Explain that, would you?

24
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:17,377
-She feels guilty.
-Why?

25
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,783
Divorce, her career. . .

26
00:06:21,026 --> 00:06:23,221
. . .away all the time.

27
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:28,222
Regan? Why don't you tell me
the truth? Don't you trust me?

28
00:06:28,426 --> 00:06:30,223
But l do. l do.

29
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:34,664
You keep saying you don't remember
that time in Washington.

30
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:37,380
l don't know if l believe you.

31
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:44,376
l remember being very sick
and having nightmares, and that's all.

32
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:50,258
Those bad dreams are still inside you.

33
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:53,378
There's nothing wrong with me.

34
00:06:55,786 --> 00:07:00,064
Regan? Regan?
l want to show you something.

35
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:06,138
You see this? This is a machine
we can use together.

36
00:07:06,346 --> 00:07:12,615
lt can put us in a state of hypnosis.
You'd be very relaxed and comfortable.

37
00:07:12,826 --> 00:07:17,946
And then we could look at those bad
dreams together and understand them.

38
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:22,105
And dissolve them.
You wouldn't be alone, Regan.

39
00:07:22,306 --> 00:07:27,061
-How do you feel about that?
-l don't think you're ready for it.

40
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:30,975
What does that mean?

41
00:07:31,186 --> 00:07:35,179
You're the doctor. You explain it.

42
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,775
Follow me, please.

43
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:15,617
Cardinal Jaros, may l present Father
Philip Lamont, Society of Jesus?

44
00:08:20,546 --> 00:08:25,142
Would you care to explain
your refusal to accept this task?

45
00:08:25,346 --> 00:08:30,625
l should be relieved from all pastoral
responsibilities. l'm not worthy.

46
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:34,785
Father, l have not asked you
to perform another exorcism.

47
00:08:34,986 --> 00:08:41,175
l simply requested that you investigate
the death of Father Merrin.

48
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:46,096
You have performed exorcisms.
You knew Father Merrin.

49
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:49,981
Furthermore, you were exposed
to his teachings.

50
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:55,579
l cannot think of anyone
more qualified for this assignment.

51
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,976
Philip, it's so good to see you.

52
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:07,581
Merrin's reputation is in jeopardy.
His writings have been impounded.

53
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:12,860
l'm not surprised. No one in the church
wants to hear about the devil.

54
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:17,662
Satan has become an embarrassment
to our progressive views.

55
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:21,381
Merrin was rather more extreme,
l'm afraid.

56
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:27,263
He argued that the power of evil
threatens to overthrow God himself.

57
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:31,175
So they found a heresy to nail him to.

58
00:09:31,386 --> 00:09:36,096
Well, many of the theological
college believe that. . .

59
00:09:36,306 --> 00:09:39,503
. . .he died at the hands
of the devil. . .

60
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,624
. . .during that American exorcism.

61
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:47,656
Some, and they are close to
the pontiff, go so far as to suggest. . .

62
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:52,098
. . .that he was a Satanist.
At the end, l mean.

63
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:55,776
Perhaps Father Merrin
took a path no one could follow.

64
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:58,625
But how he inspired us, Philip!

65
00:09:58,826 --> 00:10:04,139
Here. Remember,
Christ is hard to follow too.

66
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:11,384
We were young. Today,
wherever l look, l see only evil.

67
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:14,424
God has fallen silent.

68
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:22,185
l cannot move to safeguard
Merrin's testament. . .

69
00:10:22,386 --> 00:10:27,938
. . .until all the facts about his
last exorcism are clearly known.

70
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:30,819
You will conduct the investigation.

71
00:10:31,026 --> 00:10:35,781
You will act discreetly in all
confidence, reporting to me alone.

72
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:37,823
But l'm not worthy!

73
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:41,814
You are a soldier of Christ.
Make yourself worthy.

74
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:59,981
Okay, l want you to concentrate hard
on the name of this color. All right?

75
00:11:11,386 --> 00:11:14,025
-Gene Tuskin, Father.
-Lamont, doctor.

76
00:11:14,226 --> 00:11:15,978
Come on in.

77
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:24,023
-Liz, what does he want?
-How would l know, Regan?

78
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,979
He's here about me, isn't he?

79
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,782
Why do you say that?

80
00:11:31,946 --> 00:11:37,100
What about the coroner's report,
the testimony? The file's that thick.

81
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:38,705
Yes, l know.

82
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:43,934
Unfortunately, it sheds very
little light on Father Merrin's death.

83
00:11:44,146 --> 00:11:47,377
l was hoping to question the girl.

84
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:50,384
-Why don't you sit down?
-Thank you.

85
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:57,058
Regan suffered a severe trauma
by that experience.

86
00:11:57,266 --> 00:12:01,384
l think the exorcism
made the problem worse.

87
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:04,945
You must know that three people died.

88
00:12:05,146 --> 00:12:09,219
Regan's guilt was so great,
she repressed everything.

89
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:13,135
l'm sorry, Father.
l can't let you question her.

90
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:18,466
The shock of recall
could result in self-punishment.

91
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,578
l couldn't rule out suicide.

92
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:27,382
You have a heavy responsibility:
the care of her soul.

93
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:33,179
The care of her mind and her body
is my responsibility, Father.

94
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:39,376
You realize what you're up against,
don't you?

95
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:48,138
-What am l up against, Father?
-Evil.

96
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:55,618
Mental illness.
That's what we're up against here.

97
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:59,614
Or the casualties of
a diseased society. Evil is not--

98
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:04,502
Evil is a spiritual being,
alive and living.

99
00:13:05,146 --> 00:13:10,300
Perverted and perverting, weaving
its way into the very fabric of life.

100
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:13,179
-Sorry to disturb you.
-What is it?

101
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:17,823
l've changed my mind. l'd like
to try that machine after all.

102
00:13:18,026 --> 00:13:20,779
-Fine.
-Could we try it now?

103
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:23,659
l'm sorry. l won't intrude any longer.

104
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:27,381
lt's okay, Father.
You can stay if you'd like.

105
00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:31,977
Regan, this is Father Lamont.
Regan MacNeil.

106
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:34,980
-Hello.
-How do you do?

107
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:38,656
Well, we can do it
tomorrow then, Regan. Okay?

108
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:41,585
Father, maybe you can help me.

109
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:45,262
-All right, Regan?
-Good.

110
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:51,503
These experiments confirm that thought
can be transmitted across distances.

111
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:55,665
-Here he is, causing a spoon to bend.
-Sharon.

112
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:58,334
-Not on a stage...
-Look, l can do it.

113
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:04,018
...but under laboratory controls
and observed by skeptical scientists.

114
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:07,138
-lt's easy.
-Good God, Regan.

115
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,055
--they seem to defy natural laws.
How can that be?

116
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:15,225
Oh, look, you fool.
You believe everything!

117
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:17,257
Oh, wait, wait.

118
00:14:17,506 --> 00:14:21,579
--but is merely an illusion:
a projection of the mind.

119
00:14:22,186 --> 00:14:27,214
These are EEG biofeedback electrodes.
They pick up any brain frequency.

120
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:30,259
They're integrated
with these strobes. . .

121
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:33,936
. . .to bring two altered states
into synchronization.

122
00:14:34,146 --> 00:14:36,216
-Are you ready, Regan?
-Yes.

123
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:40,021
We're going to do this
just the way l showed you.

124
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:43,184
Now, l want you to relax your arms.

125
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:53,978
Now, l want you to concentrate
on the strobe light.

126
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:58,181
Deeply relax.

127
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:03,180
Just let yourself go
and look at the light.

128
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:20,864
Now, l want you to relax
and make your tone go deeper.

129
00:15:23,146 --> 00:15:25,580
Listen to your tone.

130
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:27,977
Deeper.

131
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,616
Deeper, Regan.

132
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:42,575
Can you hear me, Regan?

133
00:15:43,146 --> 00:15:44,545
Yes.

134
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:49,342
When you hear the alarm buzzer,
you will wake up and feel fine. . .

135
00:15:49,546 --> 00:15:54,415
. . .but you will remember nothing
that happened. Do you understand?

136
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:56,025
Yes.

137
00:15:56,226 --> 00:16:02,222
Very good. Now, do you remember
your room in Washington?

138
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:04,619
Yes.

139
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:08,739
-Can you see your room?
-No.

140
00:16:08,946 --> 00:16:11,779
Then l want you to go deeper.

141
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:16,059
Go deeper into your memory
until you can see your room.

142
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,702
Make your tone go deeper,
and you will see it.

143
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,977
Deeper.

144
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,976
Deeper, Regan. Deeper.

145
00:16:30,426 --> 00:16:32,382
Can you see it now?

146
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,465
Yes.

147
00:16:42,186 --> 00:16:47,306
l want to come down and be with you.
Do you remember how to help me?

148
00:16:47,546 --> 00:16:48,740
Yes.

149
00:16:48,946 --> 00:16:51,983
Good. Bring me down to where you are.

150
00:16:52,186 --> 00:16:56,145
You and l will obey the commands
that Liz and Father Lamont give us.

151
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:58,775
Do you understand?

152
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:00,624
Yes.

153
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:04,265
l'm going to turn my light on now.

154
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:08,379
And you will help me
bring my tone down to yours.

155
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:24,697
Can you hear me, Gene?

156
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:27,338
Yes.

157
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,418
Relax, then.

158
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:35,974
And let yourself come down
deeper and deeper. . .

159
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:38,826
. . .to meet my tone.

160
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:41,099
Relax.

161
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:43,098
Deeper.

162
00:17:43,306 --> 00:17:45,581
Deeper.

163
00:17:47,426 --> 00:17:48,984
Good.

164
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:54,619
-Doctor, can you see Regan's room?
-Yes.

165
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:03,344
Regan, do you remember the time
Father Merrin came up to you?

166
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:04,945
Yes.

167
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:10,374
Regan, you will now respond
to Father Lamont.

168
00:18:16,946 --> 00:18:20,222
-Regan?
-Yes?

169
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,980
That time in the room. . .

170
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:27,020
. . .try and remember Father Merrin
just before he died.

171
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:32,984
-We're alone.
-ls his heart strong? Resolved?

172
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,543
He is praying.

173
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:39,896
-ls he in pain?
-Yes.

174
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:46,535
-ls he casting out the unclean spirit?
-He is praying.

175
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:51,584
And you, Regan. What are you doing?

176
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:10,097
Dr. Tuskin?

177
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:14,094
Gene?

178
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:17,179
Gene, wake up!

179
00:19:17,826 --> 00:19:22,502
-What's wrong with Gene?
-Her heart, it's fibrillating!

180
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:26,619
Put that on. You've gotta go back
and find her right now.

181
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:31,986
l know where she is. Help me to find
and reach her. Liz, put this on.

182
00:19:35,986 --> 00:19:41,185
-Liz, help me to reach Dr. Tuskin.
-All right, we'll try.

183
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:48,699
Relax deeply, watch the light.

184
00:19:58,026 --> 00:20:02,383
That's good.
Let yourself go down deeper.

185
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:06,823
Listen to your tone,
and make it go deeper.

186
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:09,898
Deeper.

187
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:14,057
Deeper. Deeper.

188
00:20:56,746 --> 00:21:00,864
-Get thee hence!
-She's mine, always.

189
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:04,376
-No!
-Always.

190
00:21:06,906 --> 00:21:11,024
-Always.
-Father, please. Bring her back.

191
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,939
Father, can you hear me?

192
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:29,380
Father, please. Bring her back.

193
00:22:30,946 --> 00:22:32,459
ln God's name!

194
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:40,463
Tell Gene she will not remember.

195
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:45,777
Gene, you will not remember.
Gene, you will not remember.

196
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:04,534
-What happened?
-Are you all right?

197
00:23:04,746 --> 00:23:08,739
Your heart was fibrillating.
l don't know what went wrong.

198
00:23:08,946 --> 00:23:11,176
l couldn't bring you out of it.

199
00:23:11,386 --> 00:23:16,858
Father Lamont had to go into synch to
contact you. He brought you out of it.

200
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:22,417
-He told you not to remember.
-Do you remember?

201
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:24,423
No.

202
00:23:28,546 --> 00:23:30,776
Do you remember?

203
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,777
Come on, Regan.

204
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:39,781
l'll be right back.

205
00:23:45,746 --> 00:23:48,704
l bet they're pretty drawings.
How are you?

206
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:53,104
Want me to draw a picture?
What would you like me to draw?

207
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,582
-A house.
-A house?

208
00:23:56,986 --> 00:24:00,103
Why do you want a house?
A house is dull.

209
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:04,375
How about if l draw you a face?

210
00:24:13,426 --> 00:24:16,179
-How do you feel?
-All right. You?

211
00:24:16,386 --> 00:24:17,785
Oh, l'm fine.

212
00:24:17,986 --> 00:24:23,219
The psychological effects of synching
with another mind last a long time.

213
00:24:23,426 --> 00:24:25,382
lt's very powerful.

214
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:33,024
-Did you see what you wanted to see?
-Evil is gaining.

215
00:24:33,226 --> 00:24:37,777
-Father Merrin was killed.
-By Regan?

216
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:42,537
She didn't. lt did.
lt wasn't the mind of a child.

217
00:24:42,746 --> 00:24:46,785
lt was horrible. Utterly horrible.

218
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,583
And fascinating.

219
00:24:51,546 --> 00:24:55,778
We don't know all that much
about synchronized hypnosis yet.

220
00:24:55,986 --> 00:25:01,060
What you saw could have easily been
a dream, a fantasy, a hallucination.

221
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,063
Not a memory at all.

222
00:25:03,266 --> 00:25:08,784
Names, just names. Better to see
the face than hear the names.

223
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:17,900
l can't have a discussion now.
l have to do my rounds.

224
00:25:18,106 --> 00:25:19,619
Doctor, what l saw--

225
00:25:19,826 --> 00:25:23,535
l'm sorry.
lt'll have to wait till tomorrow.

226
00:25:23,906 --> 00:25:25,783
Hi, Amy.

227
00:25:29,346 --> 00:25:31,985
Regan did a picture of you.

228
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,779
What's it mean?

229
00:25:35,986 --> 00:25:39,979
lt's you. She draws well.

230
00:25:40,586 --> 00:25:42,383
The flames.

231
00:25:44,186 --> 00:25:45,983
Flames.

232
00:25:59,026 --> 00:26:03,975
Doctor. Doctor, the flames.
They're getting bigger.

233
00:26:04,226 --> 00:26:07,696
-We've got to put the fire out.
-Take it easy.

234
00:26:07,906 --> 00:26:12,616
lt's probably some post-flashing.
lt's an aftereffect of hypnosis.

235
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:16,262
No, you've got to help me.
We may be too late.

236
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:21,256
-Where you going?
-You've got to help me. Her picture.

237
00:26:27,426 --> 00:26:32,784
-Come on, Father. Give me a break.
-No, there's a fire somewhere.

238
00:26:47,266 --> 00:26:50,178
l'll get the fire department.

239
00:27:12,346 --> 00:27:14,382
Okay.

240
00:27:58,466 --> 00:28:03,984
You kids can go on in now.
Everything's okay. Go on in now.

241
00:28:06,146 --> 00:28:08,785
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

242
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:12,982
-Thank you.
-l got it.

243
00:28:13,186 --> 00:28:16,337
Regan's picture, the flames.
She warned us.

244
00:28:16,546 --> 00:28:20,619
That contact between us came
about through your machine.

245
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:23,977
Whatever it was,
it saved the children.

246
00:28:24,186 --> 00:28:29,021
lt took a machine. The work you're
doing is incredible. Miraculous!

247
00:28:29,226 --> 00:28:33,265
The machine is a device
to penetrate pathological states.

248
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:38,017
No, you're talking about therapy.
You don't realize the importance!

249
00:28:38,226 --> 00:28:42,185
As much as l enjoy recognition,
you're overstating it.

250
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:47,096
Don't you understand that l was
face to face with the evil in her?

251
00:28:47,306 --> 00:28:52,016
Your machine has proved that
there's an ancient demon within her!

252
00:28:52,226 --> 00:28:55,582
We must fight it, we must help her!

253
00:28:57,266 --> 00:29:01,782
lt's all okay now.
You can go on in, all right?

254
00:29:03,226 --> 00:29:06,821
l was trying to help her
before you came along.

255
00:29:07,026 --> 00:29:12,180
You must let me synch with Regan!
ln that way, you can control things.

256
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:16,216
Well, l just don't know.

257
00:29:16,426 --> 00:29:20,135
Listen, you can go in now.
lt's all clear, okay?

258
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:27,024
l know what concerns you.

259
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:31,583
That Regan will suddenly remember.
That she'll go into shock.

260
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:35,335
l believe that Regan
already remembers everything.

261
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:38,344
The deaths, the possessions,
the demons.

262
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:45,020
She's out there, all alone,
trying to deal with this thing.

263
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:46,819
All by herself.

264
00:30:05,266 --> 00:30:07,257
Come, Regan.

265
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:09,263
Come, Regan.

266
00:30:09,466 --> 00:30:12,617
We're going flying.

267
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:16,575
Far, far away.

268
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,575
Oh, good morning, Sharon.

269
00:33:31,946 --> 00:33:33,982
What got you up so early?

270
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:38,179
The doves woke me.
l guess they were hungry.

271
00:33:38,746 --> 00:33:43,058
l may not be here when you get home.
Can you let yourself in?

272
00:33:43,266 --> 00:33:46,144
-Will you be all right?
-Where are you going?

273
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:49,497
-Washington. l'll be back soon.
-Washington?

274
00:33:49,706 --> 00:33:53,779
Some things your mother didn't do
before going on location.

275
00:33:53,986 --> 00:33:55,783
Oh, okay.

276
00:33:56,946 --> 00:33:59,983
Wanna fly, babe? There you go, up.

277
00:34:41,826 --> 00:34:44,294
l'm grateful to you for coming.

278
00:34:44,506 --> 00:34:48,101
Mrs. MacNeil wants me
to help you while l can.

279
00:34:48,306 --> 00:34:51,503
She would do anything
for Father Merrin.

280
00:34:51,746 --> 00:34:54,977
She believes he gave
his life for Regan.

281
00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:01,585
Are they gonna make him a saint?

282
00:35:02,186 --> 00:35:05,781
The world doesn't want
any more saints.

283
00:35:06,226 --> 00:35:09,184
This is not an official investigation.

284
00:35:22,266 --> 00:35:26,623
When Father Merrin arrived,
how did he prepare himself?

285
00:35:26,826 --> 00:35:28,418
Did he pray?

286
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:32,585
They couldn't explain it,
the police, could they?

287
00:35:44,946 --> 00:35:47,779
Did Father Merrin ever name the demon?

288
00:35:47,986 --> 00:35:49,385
No.

289
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:51,982
lt knew him, though.

290
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:57,175
-How do you know that?
-lt called his name.

291
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:11,177
Did the demon seem
to expect Father Merrin?

292
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:12,978
Yes.

293
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:16,980
lt feared him, l think.

294
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:29,985
Was--

295
00:36:30,986 --> 00:36:33,580
Was Father Merrin afraid?

296
00:36:36,586 --> 00:36:39,384
You'd better see where it happened.

297
00:36:44,106 --> 00:36:47,655
What was her condition
when Father Merrin saw her?

298
00:36:47,866 --> 00:36:50,300
Hideous. That evil face.

299
00:36:50,506 --> 00:36:54,624
-l couldn't bear to be near her after.
-You're with her now.

300
00:36:54,826 --> 00:36:59,456
Two years l stayed away. Two haunted
years, going out of my mind.

301
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:05,024
And all the time l longed to see her.
Finally, l came back and found that. . .

302
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:08,781
. . .when l'm with her
is the only time l'm at peace.

303
00:37:08,986 --> 00:37:13,059
Why would that be? l can't understand.
lt frightens me.

304
00:37:14,706 --> 00:37:17,778
Have you tried a psychiatrist
or a priest?

305
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:22,138
-l'm talking to one now, aren't l?
-l'm not here for you.

306
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:26,465
There.

307
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:28,977
ln there.

308
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:37,982
Praying. Have you tried praying?

309
00:37:38,186 --> 00:37:39,585
Prayer?

310
00:38:21,146 --> 00:38:26,379
l pray for the soul of Father Merrin,
who died in this room.

311
00:38:26,826 --> 00:38:32,025
And for Sharon, who was touched
by the shadow of evil.

312
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:34,382
And for myself.

313
00:38:35,266 --> 00:38:36,984
For myself.

314
00:38:45,746 --> 00:38:50,058
-Next week then, Frank, okay?
-ls there any point going on?

315
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:53,776
l'll be in there fighting.

316
00:38:54,026 --> 00:38:56,745
Just as long as you are.

317
00:39:02,586 --> 00:39:03,939
-Hello.
-Hello.

318
00:39:04,146 --> 00:39:06,137
Come on in.

319
00:39:09,426 --> 00:39:11,178
Do you. . .?

320
00:39:11,426 --> 00:39:14,975
-Do you have children of your own?
-Yes, l do. Two.

321
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,541
A boy and a girl.

322
00:39:17,826 --> 00:39:20,579
l'd like to spend more time with them.

323
00:39:20,786 --> 00:39:23,903
Must be difficult,
with all your responsibilities.

324
00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:27,940
Not to mention the complications
of being divorced.

325
00:39:31,226 --> 00:39:34,104
You seem to manage.
Your heart is good.

326
00:39:35,826 --> 00:39:37,942
lt's hard to live alone.

327
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:43,405
Don't you ever need a woman, Father?

328
00:39:44,888 --> 00:39:46,719
Yes.

329
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,197
Telling secrets?

330
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:15,200
Do you remember dreaming
of Father Merrin?

331
00:40:15,408 --> 00:40:16,807
Yes.

332
00:40:17,008 --> 00:40:19,397
Can you see him now?

333
00:40:20,248 --> 00:40:22,204
Yes.

334
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:24,640
Where is he?

335
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:36,278
It was long ago when I was studying
the holy men of Africa.

336
00:40:36,528 --> 00:40:39,406
This boy, this young boy...

337
00:40:39,608 --> 00:40:41,485
...has very special powers.

338
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:46,037
They need his help
against the locust swarm.

339
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:48,677
But perhaps this swarm comes...

340
00:40:48,888 --> 00:40:51,402
...because of the boy.

341
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:56,401
Does great goodness
draw evil upon itself?

342
00:41:05,648 --> 00:41:09,243
Now, Regan, Father Lamont
is hypnotized too.

343
00:41:09,448 --> 00:41:12,042
l want you to bring him down to you.

344
00:41:12,288 --> 00:41:14,244
Tell him what to do.

345
00:41:14,488 --> 00:41:15,762
Father Lamont?

346
00:41:17,128 --> 00:41:18,322
Yes?

347
00:41:20,008 --> 00:41:21,521
Call me.

348
00:41:22,808 --> 00:41:24,002
Regan.

349
00:42:07,688 --> 00:42:11,601
l am Pazuzu!

350
00:42:13,808 --> 00:42:15,799
Pazuzu!

351
00:42:18,728 --> 00:42:21,800
Call me by my dream name.

352
00:42:25,888 --> 00:42:27,116
Call me.

353
00:42:27,688 --> 00:42:29,997
Pazuzu.

354
00:42:30,688 --> 00:42:33,600
King of the spirits of the air!

355
00:42:34,288 --> 00:42:35,960
Pazuzu!

356
00:42:36,248 --> 00:42:38,842
King of the evil spirits of the air!

357
00:42:40,288 --> 00:42:43,007
Spirits of the air!

358
00:43:20,248 --> 00:43:21,806
All-powerful God!

359
00:43:22,008 --> 00:43:25,842
You gave power to your apostles
to pass through dangers!

360
00:43:26,088 --> 00:43:27,441
Give us strength!

361
00:44:09,608 --> 00:44:11,200
Fear not!

362
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,439
We are safe inside!

363
00:44:13,688 --> 00:44:17,044
Even Pazuzu with all his legions. . .

364
00:44:17,248 --> 00:44:20,285
. . .cannot transgress
this holiest of places.

365
00:44:22,808 --> 00:44:26,005
Get thee hence, Satan!

366
00:44:27,088 --> 00:44:29,602
Be uprooted!

367
00:44:30,488 --> 00:44:33,480
Be expelled from this creature of God!

368
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:37,603
l command you to the depths of hell!

369
00:44:56,288 --> 00:44:58,006
-Merrin defeated you.
-No!

370
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:01,837
In his own place of power,
he gained a little time.

371
00:45:02,048 --> 00:45:06,838
It was because the boy was a healer
that you attacked him. Now I see.

372
00:45:07,048 --> 00:45:09,608
-But Merrin saved him!
-Never!

373
00:45:09,888 --> 00:45:12,846
I could claim Kokumo even now.

374
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:16,000
-I'll show you power.
-He's still alive!

375
00:45:16,248 --> 00:45:20,605
-Where is he?
-You want me to take you to him?

376
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:22,482
Yes.

377
00:45:22,688 --> 00:45:24,997
Are you sure?

378
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:28,605
Show me.

379
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:40,006
Come fly the teeth of the wind.

380
00:45:40,248 --> 00:45:43,206
Share my wings.

381
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:12,847
-What was it?
-A leopard.

382
00:47:13,088 --> 00:47:15,966
He jumped at me.
The boy's still alive.

383
00:47:17,448 --> 00:47:19,245
He frightened Pazuzu.

384
00:47:19,488 --> 00:47:22,764
-Do you remember anything?
-Was it in Africa?

385
00:47:24,248 --> 00:47:25,966
Why do you say that?

386
00:47:26,168 --> 00:47:30,207
lt was like what l saw
at the Natural History Museum.

387
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:36,403
-But you weren't supposed to remember.
-l know.

388
00:47:38,008 --> 00:47:42,399
-Okay, Regan, that's all for today.
-Okay.

389
00:47:56,288 --> 00:48:01,521
Pazuzu showed me that boy. He's a man
now, in a strange mud city in Africa.

390
00:48:01,728 --> 00:48:03,798
Perhaps l can find him.

391
00:48:04,008 --> 00:48:08,445
He has a power over evil.
Regan recognized one of those places.

392
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:13,444
But she told us it was something
she remembered from the museum.

393
00:48:13,648 --> 00:48:15,400
Let me ask her.

394
00:48:15,648 --> 00:48:20,005
Just a minute. Take it easy.
l want to take a look at you.

395
00:48:39,488 --> 00:48:40,921
Hi.

396
00:48:42,408 --> 00:48:45,559
Hi. Are you waiting for Dr. Tuskin?

397
00:48:47,408 --> 00:48:50,002
She's very nice, isn't she?

398
00:48:51,848 --> 00:48:54,203
What's the matter with you?

399
00:49:07,648 --> 00:49:12,642
l'm autistic.

400
00:49:13,688 --> 00:49:15,565
How do you mean?

401
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:21,957
l'm withdrawn.

402
00:49:23,888 --> 00:49:26,561
l can't talk.

403
00:49:26,768 --> 00:49:29,282
But you're talking now.

404
00:49:29,528 --> 00:49:32,406
Yes, you are. l can hear you.

405
00:49:35,488 --> 00:49:39,276
-You can hear me?
-Sure!

406
00:49:47,848 --> 00:49:49,440
What's. . .

407
00:49:49,688 --> 00:49:51,167
. . .the matter with you?

408
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:54,199
l was possessed by a demon.

409
00:49:56,168 --> 00:49:58,284
Oh, it's okay. He's gone.

410
00:49:59,768 --> 00:50:04,284
Dr. Tuskin would like Sandra
to visit her voice therapy class.

411
00:50:04,488 --> 00:50:08,037
Hey, Mom. You know
what happened to her?

412
00:50:09,728 --> 00:50:12,196
You're talking!

413
00:50:13,368 --> 00:50:14,926
Talking!

414
00:50:16,448 --> 00:50:20,202
Can you hear me, Mother?

415
00:50:20,448 --> 00:50:23,406
She's talking!

416
00:50:23,928 --> 00:50:26,601
-God. . . .
-Call Gene.

417
00:50:26,808 --> 00:50:29,038
Are you all right?

418
00:50:29,288 --> 00:50:32,803
Mother, it's all right.

419
00:50:35,568 --> 00:50:38,287
-What is it?
-Regan's got Sandra talking!

420
00:50:38,488 --> 00:50:41,207
-What?
-l've got to take her right home!

421
00:50:41,408 --> 00:50:44,400
Her father's got to hear
before she stops!

422
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:48,760
-She's not going to stop.
-No, don't stop, baby, no!

423
00:50:49,008 --> 00:50:52,478
-Keep talking!
-Come on in my office.

424
00:50:52,688 --> 00:50:58,046
No! Her father would never forgive me.
l've got to take her home!

425
00:50:58,248 --> 00:51:01,843
All right, take her home.
Liz, you go with them.

426
00:51:02,088 --> 00:51:03,919
Come on.

427
00:51:04,848 --> 00:51:06,998
What did you do?

428
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:10,924
Nothing. l just started
talking to her.

429
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:16,196
First she was talking inside,
and then she started talking outside.

430
00:51:17,288 --> 00:51:22,237
Gene, do you think l could start
helping some of your other kids?

431
00:51:22,488 --> 00:51:28,404
You know, Regan, it's very dangerous
to fool with other people's heads.

432
00:51:28,808 --> 00:51:31,402
Sandra seems to be all right. . .

433
00:51:31,648 --> 00:51:33,479
. . .but don't try that again.

434
00:51:33,728 --> 00:51:35,366
-Until--
-Until what?

435
00:51:36,488 --> 00:51:39,685
Well, until you're older.

436
00:51:40,288 --> 00:51:42,006
Okay.

437
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:44,438
Well, there's Sharon. Bye!

438
00:51:46,608 --> 00:51:50,999
Don't tell Sharon because she'll just
call Mom and worry her. Okay?

439
00:51:53,208 --> 00:51:57,247
-l don't want to hear any speculation.
-She entered her mind!

440
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:01,487
-Let's stick to science.
-Don't hide behind science.

441
00:52:01,688 --> 00:52:05,840
Listen, l'm responsible for Regan
while her mother's away.

442
00:52:06,048 --> 00:52:11,202
-You stay away from her! Cut it out!
-You must fight that demon inside her!

443
00:52:11,448 --> 00:52:14,485
-lt keeps her from spiritual power.
-Demons?

444
00:52:14,688 --> 00:52:18,237
We make our own, up here.
You're obsessed with the idea!

445
00:52:18,448 --> 00:52:21,724
l'm not! l'm fascinated,
but l know the dangers.

446
00:52:21,928 --> 00:52:25,477
Father Merrin was afraid
he'd slip into admiration.

447
00:52:25,688 --> 00:52:28,600
How about adulation?

448
00:53:07,888 --> 00:53:10,402
Hello, Father.

449
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:14,800
How did you know l was coming here?

450
00:53:15,488 --> 00:53:17,240
Well, l didn't. . .

451
00:53:17,488 --> 00:53:19,399
. . .for sure.

452
00:53:22,488 --> 00:53:24,797
l'm not allowed to talk to you.

453
00:53:25,688 --> 00:53:27,997
Doctor's orders.

454
00:53:30,688 --> 00:53:32,406
Father?

455
00:53:32,648 --> 00:53:37,802
-Do priests believe in ESP?
-Some do.

456
00:53:38,488 --> 00:53:44,643
A French priest thought we'd all come
together in some sort of telepathy.

457
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:50,246
A kind of ''world mind'' in which
everybody would share.

458
00:53:50,488 --> 00:53:53,605
When is that supposed to happen?

459
00:53:53,808 --> 00:53:56,003
l don't know.

460
00:53:56,408 --> 00:54:01,641
Father Merrin believed that, with
modern research, it could happen soon.

461
00:54:01,888 --> 00:54:05,597
l mean the kind of research
Dr. Tuskin is doing.

462
00:54:05,888 --> 00:54:09,005
But if it happens
before we're ready. . .

463
00:54:10,688 --> 00:54:16,604
. . .we may find ourselves pointing
in the wrong direction, toward Satan.

464
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,797
Look, Father.

465
00:54:24,008 --> 00:54:26,203
That's it!

466
00:54:27,088 --> 00:54:31,001
That's where Father Merrin
fought Pazuzu.

467
00:54:31,488 --> 00:54:34,002
You remember Father Merrin?

468
00:54:37,248 --> 00:54:39,808
What else do you remember?

469
00:54:40,688 --> 00:54:42,246
Everything.

470
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:44,797
Aren't you afraid?

471
00:54:47,488 --> 00:54:51,003
l wish l could tell you not to be,
but l can't.

472
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:56,400
Why wasn't that man with the leopard
afraid of Pazuzu?

473
00:54:57,048 --> 00:54:59,198
l don't know.

474
00:55:00,048 --> 00:55:04,599
-l'll try to find out.
-His name is Kokumo.

475
00:55:11,248 --> 00:55:13,808
Kokumo. . . .

476
00:55:15,488 --> 00:55:20,403
lf he can teach me
how he has survived Pazuzu. . .

477
00:55:22,688 --> 00:55:25,407
. . .l'll come back and let you know.

478
00:55:27,888 --> 00:55:30,004
l must go to Africa right away!

479
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:33,644
lf l can find this man Kokumo,
it will prove. . .

480
00:55:34,048 --> 00:55:36,437
. . .that the exorcisms were valid.

481
00:55:36,648 --> 00:55:38,206
But more than that. . .

482
00:55:38,408 --> 00:55:43,402
. . .remember how Merrin prophesied that
new men would arise to purge evil?

483
00:55:43,608 --> 00:55:48,204
They may already be among us.
Kokumo could be one of them.

484
00:55:48,448 --> 00:55:52,726
l saw him in a vision.
l saw his power over evil.

485
00:55:53,488 --> 00:55:58,278
l've asked you to investigate
the exorcisms of Father Merrin. . .

486
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:03,198
. . .not to step into his shoes.
You are in dire need of prayer.

487
00:56:03,408 --> 00:56:06,957
-l suggest you make a retreat!
-Why not an advance?

488
00:56:07,488 --> 00:56:13,199
Lamont, you are in open defiance of
the church! l beg you to reconsider!

489
00:56:13,688 --> 00:56:18,000
l have no choice but to relieve you
of your assignment.

490
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,041
You will refrain
from any further action.

491
00:56:21,248 --> 00:56:24,206
We'll speak again after your retreat.

492
00:57:24,048 --> 00:57:26,198
Thank you.

493
01:00:05,888 --> 01:00:08,004
l am in mortal sin. . .

494
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:11,041
. . .disobedience, pride. . .

495
01:00:11,288 --> 01:00:13,597
. . .but evil overwhelms us!

496
01:00:13,808 --> 01:00:16,003
l had to disobey!

497
01:00:16,248 --> 01:00:19,001
l had to disobey!

498
01:00:40,808 --> 01:00:42,207
Where is she?

499
01:00:42,408 --> 01:00:46,196
She's on the roof. She's always there.

500
01:00:52,408 --> 01:00:55,002
l can't lock her up.

501
01:01:11,408 --> 01:01:15,606
-l wish you'd help Father Lamont.
-What do you mean?

502
01:01:15,808 --> 01:01:18,197
He needs your help.

503
01:01:18,688 --> 01:01:21,600
How can l help him? l don't know how.

504
01:01:21,848 --> 01:01:23,998
Yes, you do.

505
01:01:24,608 --> 01:01:27,076
Regan, what are you talking about?

506
01:01:27,288 --> 01:01:33,045
Well, you know. Going into synch,
trying to reach him like that.

507
01:01:33,288 --> 01:01:36,246
But you told me he's in Africa.

508
01:01:36,488 --> 01:01:39,207
When you're in synch, it's different.

509
01:01:39,408 --> 01:01:42,639
l mean, it doesn't matter
where you are.

510
01:01:42,888 --> 01:01:44,640
You can find them.

511
01:01:44,888 --> 01:01:46,640
You know. . .

512
01:01:46,888 --> 01:01:48,799
. . .help them.

513
01:01:49,528 --> 01:01:52,838
ls that why you haven't been
coming to see me?

514
01:01:53,048 --> 01:01:57,599
-Because l won't let you go into synch?
-Yes.

515
01:02:01,488 --> 01:02:03,797
l can't.

516
01:02:10,808 --> 01:02:14,403
l have to do what l think is
best for you.

517
01:02:18,648 --> 01:02:22,084
ls there anyone who would remember
Father Merrin?

518
01:02:22,288 --> 01:02:25,803
Perhaps the abbot. l can ask him.

519
01:02:40,088 --> 01:02:43,444
He knew Father Merrin.
He says he was very holy.

520
01:02:43,648 --> 01:02:46,401
Did he know Kokumo?

521
01:02:49,888 --> 01:02:54,404
Merrin came up here once
with a boy who was very sick.

522
01:02:55,888 --> 01:02:58,038
There was an accident.

523
01:02:58,248 --> 01:03:00,808
A wind, what do you say--?
A devil wind.

524
01:03:01,048 --> 01:03:04,006
And a monk fell to his death.

525
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:10,000
The big wind raised much dust,
and the body was never found.

526
01:03:10,248 --> 01:03:13,604
They searched all over, everywhere.

527
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:22,804
He didn't fall there. He bounced
on that ledge and fell there.

528
01:03:23,288 --> 01:03:25,597
l'll show you!

529
01:03:35,288 --> 01:03:37,006
Be careful!

530
01:03:39,888 --> 01:03:41,560
Wait! Wait for me!

531
01:04:45,288 --> 01:04:46,687
Over there!

532
01:04:46,888 --> 01:04:49,800
ln the cleft of that rock over there.

533
01:05:13,888 --> 01:05:18,678
-How did you know the body was here?
-He was killed by the demon Pazuzu!

534
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:27,647
l flew with Pazuzu in a trance!

535
01:05:31,888 --> 01:05:36,245
lt's difficult to explain.
l was under hypnosis.

536
01:05:36,488 --> 01:05:40,003
No, Father! Please wait!

537
01:05:43,088 --> 01:05:45,238
Stop, Father, wait!

538
01:05:47,888 --> 01:05:49,799
Father!

539
01:05:50,008 --> 01:05:51,236
Please!

540
01:05:52,608 --> 01:05:53,802
No!

541
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:57,405
Father Abbot! Listen to me!

542
01:05:58,808 --> 01:06:01,845
He will not speak
to a devil-worshiper!

543
01:06:02,048 --> 01:06:04,482
l am not a devil-worshiper!

544
01:07:17,688 --> 01:07:21,442
Please don't drug me.
Don't put me under, Gene.

545
01:07:22,608 --> 01:07:25,202
l'm okay now.

546
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:29,481
-lt'll make you sleep.
-But it will stop me from dreaming.

547
01:07:29,688 --> 01:07:32,805
Maybe that will be good for a while.

548
01:07:37,488 --> 01:07:40,002
But he needs me.

549
01:07:40,248 --> 01:07:41,920
l've got to find him.

550
01:07:43,088 --> 01:07:46,285
You'll be fine. You'll be just fine.

551
01:07:48,088 --> 01:07:51,000
You're trying to kill my. . . .

552
01:07:52,408 --> 01:07:55,002
My soul.

553
01:08:09,648 --> 01:08:13,197
A Muslim city with mud walls, golden.

554
01:09:07,488 --> 01:09:10,685
Mud city with golden walls?
Sounds like Jepti.

555
01:09:10,888 --> 01:09:14,403
-You know it?
-l know every holy place in Africa.

556
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:16,644
Religion's my business.

557
01:09:16,848 --> 01:09:22,047
Plastic saints, icons,
Buddhas, voodoo gris-gris. . . .

558
01:09:22,288 --> 01:09:25,963
Edwards is my name.
Ecumenical Edwards, they call me.

559
01:09:26,168 --> 01:09:29,399
Philip Lamont, archaeologist.

560
01:09:30,488 --> 01:09:33,207
lt's nice to know you, Father.

561
01:09:51,088 --> 01:09:52,840
What now?

562
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:54,680
Locusts!

563
01:09:55,848 --> 01:09:57,998
Spraying for locusts!

564
01:09:58,208 --> 01:10:01,359
This is the traditional route
of the plague!

565
01:10:01,568 --> 01:10:06,198
They think they can stop them
with DDT!

566
01:10:06,688 --> 01:10:10,476
-l've flown this route before!
-When was that?

567
01:10:12,488 --> 01:10:14,046
lt was--

568
01:10:14,288 --> 01:10:16,802
lt was on the wings of a demon!

569
01:10:20,808 --> 01:10:23,800
Did he take you to Jepti?

570
01:10:24,288 --> 01:10:26,802
Yes, he did.

571
01:14:29,288 --> 01:14:31,802
Almighty God. . .

572
01:14:32,048 --> 01:14:34,039
. . .help me.

573
01:14:34,288 --> 01:14:37,041
l must find Kokumo.

574
01:14:37,288 --> 01:14:43,204
l have resisted.
l have not called on Pazuzu.

575
01:14:44,288 --> 01:14:46,404
Help me.

576
01:14:48,688 --> 01:14:50,599
Call me.

577
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:55,004
Regan.

578
01:14:58,088 --> 01:15:01,398
Call me by my dream name.

579
01:15:06,288 --> 01:15:09,007
Call me.

580
01:15:11,808 --> 01:15:16,836
Pazuzu, prince of the evil spirits
of the air, take me to Kokumo.

581
01:16:04,488 --> 01:16:09,403
l call upon you in the name
of Father Lankester Merrin.

582
01:16:11,808 --> 01:16:13,878
How did you find me?

583
01:16:14,088 --> 01:16:18,206
l saw you in the mind of a girl
who was possessed by Pazuzu.

584
01:16:19,688 --> 01:16:23,567
-She is still in danger of dreams.
-How can l help her?

585
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:28,678
Which girl would you help?

586
01:16:28,888 --> 01:16:33,166
The one possessed by Pazuzu
or the one held by Father Merrin?

587
01:16:33,688 --> 01:16:36,998
You must pluck out her evil heart. . .

588
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:40,405
. . .but Pazuzu has brushed you
with his wings.

589
01:16:40,608 --> 01:16:43,281
You called on Pazuzu to reach me.

590
01:16:43,488 --> 01:16:46,958
You've lost faith in your God.
You do not believe.

591
01:16:47,168 --> 01:16:51,480
l do believe! l'll do anything
to help Regan! Anything!

592
01:16:51,688 --> 01:16:54,441
Then prove your faith. Cross over.

593
01:16:59,568 --> 01:17:03,561
My faith is in Jesus Christ, reborn.

594
01:17:05,168 --> 01:17:08,478
Prove it. Cross over!

595
01:17:09,088 --> 01:17:11,682
Step out of your despair.

596
01:17:11,928 --> 01:17:15,762
lf Pazuzu comes for you,
l will spit a leopard.

597
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:13,485
Can l help you?

598
01:18:15,968 --> 01:18:18,880
l fell. l failed!

599
01:18:20,968 --> 01:18:24,677
The heat, perhaps.
Come inside, it's cooler.

600
01:18:24,888 --> 01:18:27,163
-Who are you?
-My name is Kokumo.

601
01:18:27,368 --> 01:18:30,519
-Did you know Father Lankester Merrin?
-Yes.

602
01:18:30,728 --> 01:18:33,879
When l was young, in Ethiopia.
Wonderful man.

603
01:18:34,088 --> 01:18:38,286
He died while exorcising
the demon Pazuzu from a young girl.

604
01:18:38,488 --> 01:18:42,276
-Were you ever. . .?
-Possessed by Pazuzu?

605
01:18:42,488 --> 01:18:44,956
That's what my mother
used to tell me.

606
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:48,197
-Locusts?
-Yes!

607
01:18:48,448 --> 01:18:50,120
Let me show you!

608
01:18:50,368 --> 01:18:54,884
This is one of the main control
stations in equatorial Africa.

609
01:18:56,568 --> 01:18:59,878
The key factor
is the brushing of the wings.

610
01:19:00,768 --> 01:19:02,565
When it is dry. . .

611
01:19:02,768 --> 01:19:06,556
. . .the grasshoppers go their own way,
happy individuals.

612
01:19:06,768 --> 01:19:10,317
When a heavy rain hatches them
in large numbers. . .

613
01:19:10,528 --> 01:19:14,726
. . .they crowd together.
Their wings brush against each other.

614
01:19:14,928 --> 01:19:17,886
The agitation transforms them.

615
01:19:21,968 --> 01:19:25,881
Here, you see them
in their various forms.

616
01:19:39,928 --> 01:19:44,843
Most importantly, the brushing of
the wings changes their personality.

617
01:19:45,048 --> 01:19:50,361
They become a destructive, voracious,
marauding swarm, with a single mind.

618
01:19:54,168 --> 01:19:57,478
A locust mind, if you will.

619
01:20:06,328 --> 01:20:11,527
The evil swarm sweeps over the earth,
possessing all that it touches.

620
01:20:11,768 --> 01:20:15,283
Evil breeding evil by contact.

621
01:20:16,488 --> 01:20:20,322
ls there no hope
once the wings have brushed you?

622
01:20:20,568 --> 01:20:22,479
We try.

623
01:20:22,728 --> 01:20:24,878
With the help of science.

624
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:27,283
Look at this young female.

625
01:20:28,128 --> 01:20:32,360
She has been evolved to resist
the brushing of the wings.

626
01:20:32,568 --> 01:20:34,638
At least, that is our hope.

627
01:20:34,848 --> 01:20:38,045
We like to call her the Good Locust.

628
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:43,683
Her children will be
our agents in the swarm.

629
01:20:43,968 --> 01:20:45,879
Breaking the chain reaction.

630
01:20:46,088 --> 01:20:50,286
Remaining forever
happy-go-lucky grasshoppers.

631
01:20:50,528 --> 01:20:52,883
Let us pray it succeeds.

632
01:20:54,368 --> 01:20:56,518
The Good Locust?

633
01:21:42,488 --> 01:21:46,083
-Where do you think you're going?
-lt's okay.

634
01:22:10,168 --> 01:22:12,887
l can't get you out of the bath.

635
01:22:15,248 --> 01:22:17,682
Oh, l lost the soap!

636
01:22:22,488 --> 01:22:24,206
You got me all wet!

637
01:22:24,448 --> 01:22:27,804
Call back tomorrow.
You got me all wet, look!

638
01:22:31,368 --> 01:22:32,767
Hello?

639
01:22:36,168 --> 01:22:37,567
When?

640
01:22:41,288 --> 01:22:43,677
Does Dr. Tuskin know?

641
01:22:45,368 --> 01:22:47,518
Well, where is the doctor?

642
01:22:47,768 --> 01:22:50,077
Hold on, that could be Regan.

643
01:22:55,208 --> 01:22:56,607
You!

644
01:22:58,248 --> 01:23:02,082
lt's all your fault.
Regan's sick. You stirred it up.

645
01:23:02,288 --> 01:23:05,883
She's left the hospital.
God knows where she is!

646
01:23:06,088 --> 01:23:09,125
-l have to see her.
-You have some nerve!

647
01:23:09,328 --> 01:23:12,877
Please. l can help her.
Only l can help her--

648
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:14,885
Leave us alone!

649
01:23:15,168 --> 01:23:19,525
We don't wanna hear about demons
or God or anything!

650
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:21,400
Just get out of here!

651
01:24:02,368 --> 01:24:04,359
They put you in a hospital.

652
01:24:04,568 --> 01:24:07,287
Dr. Tuskin doesn't understand.

653
01:24:11,288 --> 01:24:15,281
-Did you find the man with the leopard?
-l did.

654
01:24:17,528 --> 01:24:20,679
Did he tell you how to fight Pazuzu?

655
01:24:21,168 --> 01:24:23,284
He told me. . .

656
01:24:23,688 --> 01:24:27,078
. . .good and evil
are struggling within you.

657
01:24:28,328 --> 01:24:30,080
We must fight it.

658
01:24:31,928 --> 01:24:34,078
l brought this with me.

659
01:24:35,568 --> 01:24:37,479
The synchronizer?

660
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:41,676
Why don't you phone the police?

661
01:24:43,928 --> 01:24:45,327
No.

662
01:24:45,528 --> 01:24:48,281
Gary? Linda?

663
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:51,965
Get your things.
l'll drop you at Miss Billing's.

664
01:24:52,168 --> 01:24:53,886
That's no fair, Mom.

665
01:24:54,128 --> 01:24:57,677
-l know, but l have to.
-What are you gonna do?

666
01:24:57,888 --> 01:25:00,083
Find her myself.

667
01:25:00,448 --> 01:25:02,279
And him too.

668
01:25:30,768 --> 01:25:33,123
-Do you remember Sandra?
-Yes.

669
01:25:33,368 --> 01:25:35,677
She's still talking.

670
01:25:36,648 --> 01:25:40,561
You have a great gift.
Keep it from evil.

671
01:25:55,568 --> 01:25:58,685
Pazuzu will brush me with his wings.

672
01:25:59,288 --> 01:26:01,483
Don't be afraid.

673
01:26:01,968 --> 01:26:04,880
Father Merrin will help us.

674
01:26:18,528 --> 01:26:20,439
All right, Regan.

675
01:26:20,648 --> 01:26:23,685
l'm ready. Bring me down.

676
01:26:26,728 --> 01:26:28,878
He is with me.

677
01:26:30,168 --> 01:26:31,965
Come down.

678
01:26:32,968 --> 01:26:35,323
Down, Father.

679
01:26:36,048 --> 01:26:38,278
To meet me.

680
01:26:58,688 --> 01:27:01,998
You're dying, Merrin, dying!

681
01:27:02,248 --> 01:27:05,877
And your hopes die with you!

682
01:27:14,768 --> 01:27:19,888
Not only Kokumo, but others like him,
began to appear in the world.

683
01:27:20,088 --> 01:27:22,318
I found them where I could...

684
01:27:22,568 --> 01:27:25,685
...and tried to protect them
against evil.

685
01:27:28,008 --> 01:27:32,479
So Satan has sent Pazuzu
to destroy this goodness.

686
01:27:32,848 --> 01:27:34,440
Why me?

687
01:27:34,648 --> 01:27:36,400
l heal the sick.

688
01:27:40,448 --> 01:27:43,758
Philip, you must take my place.

689
01:27:44,048 --> 01:27:50,078
She is precious,
and I entrust her to you.

690
01:28:24,288 --> 01:28:26,085
Father?

691
01:28:34,088 --> 01:28:35,680
What's--?

692
01:28:39,328 --> 01:28:43,287
Father, wait!
Father, where are you going?

693
01:28:45,488 --> 01:28:48,764
-Why would they come here?
-The synchronizer.

694
01:28:48,968 --> 01:28:52,881
-lt's gone! She's way ahead of us.
-l know she is.

695
01:28:53,088 --> 01:28:56,637
-Any news?
-Regan's taken the synchronizer.

696
01:29:09,168 --> 01:29:10,840
See me.

697
01:29:11,528 --> 01:29:13,678
Please, see me.

698
01:29:47,488 --> 01:29:49,683
Gene, it's her. Line two.

699
01:29:51,248 --> 01:29:55,719
-Regan?
-Gene, look, l took the synchronizer.

700
01:29:55,928 --> 01:29:58,601
l'm sorry, but l had to. l needed it.

701
01:29:58,808 --> 01:30:01,447
l left it at the Dixie Hotel, room 27.

702
01:30:02,008 --> 01:30:04,761
-Where are you?
-Penn Station.

703
01:30:04,968 --> 01:30:07,402
-ls he with you?
-Yes.

704
01:30:07,648 --> 01:30:11,436
He's going to Washington, isn 't he?
To the house?

705
01:30:11,648 --> 01:30:13,718
Regan, don't go with him.

706
01:30:13,928 --> 01:30:17,603
l have to. lt's my fault.
He's doing it for me.

707
01:30:17,808 --> 01:30:21,483
Regan, listen to me.
You're in terrible danger.

708
01:30:23,288 --> 01:30:26,041
Gene, l gotta go. l'm sorry. Bye.

709
01:30:32,088 --> 01:30:33,885
Where is she?

710
01:30:34,528 --> 01:30:36,041
Penn Station.

711
01:30:44,168 --> 01:30:45,806
Hey, stop that!

712
01:30:50,568 --> 01:30:52,877
Stupid bitch!

713
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:55,678
-Where are you going?
-Washington.

714
01:30:55,888 --> 01:31:00,484
-l'm going with you.
-Call my kids. l'll be in touch.

715
01:31:23,768 --> 01:31:26,077
Father, tickets!

716
01:31:26,328 --> 01:31:28,478
Do you have any money?

717
01:31:39,768 --> 01:31:42,919
No, l'm with him! He's sick.

718
01:31:43,168 --> 01:31:46,205
They-- They gave him an injection.

719
01:31:46,448 --> 01:31:49,679
Leave her alone. She belongs to me!

720
01:31:59,728 --> 01:32:01,366
lt's an accident.

721
01:32:01,568 --> 01:32:03,286
Doctor!

722
01:32:04,608 --> 01:32:07,281
l need a doctor!

723
01:32:08,528 --> 01:32:12,282
Drive on. Someone must
have called an ambulance.

724
01:32:24,768 --> 01:32:27,487
Well, Regan can wait, l guess.

725
01:32:29,928 --> 01:32:33,079
Wait! l'm a doctor. l'll help you.

726
01:32:33,528 --> 01:32:35,280
Let me see.

727
01:32:35,528 --> 01:32:37,280
Hold still.

728
01:32:45,568 --> 01:32:47,240
The power.

729
01:32:47,448 --> 01:32:51,680
lt's getting nearer.
Can't you feel it?

730
01:32:52,688 --> 01:32:56,476
The power is immense. lt fills me.

731
01:32:56,968 --> 01:32:59,277
l can do anything.

732
01:33:00,168 --> 01:33:01,681
Gene. . . .

733
01:33:02,248 --> 01:33:04,478
You called Gene, didn't you?

734
01:33:32,168 --> 01:33:35,478
Father, please don't be lost to me.

735
01:33:49,528 --> 01:33:52,884
-Why don't you loosen your tie?
-Thank you.

736
01:33:59,488 --> 01:34:02,286
Why are you looking at me like that?

737
01:34:04,648 --> 01:34:06,684
The power.

738
01:34:07,568 --> 01:34:09,684
l must take you there.

739
01:34:10,368 --> 01:34:13,280
Did Kokumo tell you that?

740
01:34:14,488 --> 01:34:16,126
He said. . .

741
01:34:17,048 --> 01:34:19,278
. . .the Good Locust. . . .

742
01:34:22,888 --> 01:34:25,880
-We'll get a taxi. Quick, hurry!
-Yes.

743
01:34:26,128 --> 01:34:28,005
Taxi! Taxi!

744
01:34:28,248 --> 01:34:30,318
-There's one!
-Hey, lady!

745
01:34:30,568 --> 01:34:32,684
Lady, that's my taxi!

746
01:34:32,888 --> 01:34:34,287
Animals!

747
01:34:34,808 --> 01:34:36,605
-Sorry about that.
-People!

748
01:34:51,528 --> 01:34:53,120
Where to?

749
01:34:53,368 --> 01:34:55,245
Give him the address.

750
01:34:55,848 --> 01:34:58,885
Georgetown. 8 Prospect Street.

751
01:34:59,288 --> 01:35:03,281
-8 Prospect Street?
-Yes! Come on, let's go!

752
01:35:15,488 --> 01:35:18,286
Get going! The girl has to get home!

753
01:35:26,328 --> 01:35:28,284
What now?

754
01:35:28,688 --> 01:35:31,282
l'm gonna see about this!

755
01:35:33,608 --> 01:35:36,486
-lt won't do no good.
-She's a doctor.

756
01:35:36,728 --> 01:35:40,960
-No difference. This is Washington.
-Someone's dying.

757
01:35:45,728 --> 01:35:47,684
Father, no!

758
01:36:21,448 --> 01:36:23,166
Father, wait!

759
01:36:23,368 --> 01:36:25,882
Driver, please hurry!

760
01:36:41,008 --> 01:36:42,407
Come on!

761
01:36:49,248 --> 01:36:51,682
This is Prospect Street now.

762
01:37:05,168 --> 01:37:07,079
There's the house.

763
01:37:21,288 --> 01:37:23,040
l can't control it!

764
01:37:26,288 --> 01:37:28,279
lt's going crazy!

765
01:37:35,888 --> 01:37:37,480
Oh, my God!

766
01:38:19,968 --> 01:38:22,687
Let me reach you.

767
01:38:43,288 --> 01:38:44,880
Sharon?

768
01:38:45,088 --> 01:38:47,682
Get me out of here!

769
01:38:47,928 --> 01:38:50,283
Help me!

770
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:54,323
We've got to help Regan!

771
01:39:10,328 --> 01:39:13,081
At least help Regan!

772
01:39:13,288 --> 01:39:16,758
-To do what?
-To fight this thing!

773
01:39:16,968 --> 01:39:18,447
Name it.

774
01:39:20,328 --> 01:39:22,284
Pazuzu.

775
01:40:04,168 --> 01:40:06,238
l've got to get inside.

776
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:08,678
Let me inside!

777
01:40:19,888 --> 01:40:21,685
Regan. . . .

778
01:40:25,328 --> 01:40:28,877
No! Father Lamont, help me!

779
01:40:29,088 --> 01:40:32,319
Kokumo! Remember Father Merrin?

780
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:33,967
No!

781
01:40:35,168 --> 01:40:38,524
He's mine. He's chosen me.

782
01:40:38,768 --> 01:40:43,284
Pazuzu's Regan is the only Regan!

783
01:40:48,528 --> 01:40:50,837
Be joined with us, Father.

784
01:41:00,648 --> 01:41:02,286
Please.

785
01:41:02,768 --> 01:41:04,804
Kill her.

786
01:41:33,528 --> 01:41:36,201
The wings. The wings are brushing me!

787
01:41:36,408 --> 01:41:39,844
The wings are brushing me!
l must! l must!

788
01:41:40,568 --> 01:41:43,241
We like to call her the Good Locust.

789
01:41:43,448 --> 01:41:47,157
She was evolved to resist
the brushing of the wings.

790
01:41:48,088 --> 01:41:52,445
No! Once the wings have brushed you,
you're mine forever!

791
01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:55,802
She will break the chain reaction.

792
01:41:56,008 --> 01:41:58,203
Kill her! We command you!

793
01:42:05,368 --> 01:42:08,087
Why me? Why me?

794
01:42:26,528 --> 01:42:30,237
You must tear out her evil heart.

795
01:42:46,328 --> 01:42:48,717
Pazuzu!

796
01:43:12,168 --> 01:43:13,806
