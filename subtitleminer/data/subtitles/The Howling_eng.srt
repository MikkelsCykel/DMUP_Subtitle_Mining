in our long evolution
into civilized human beings.

27
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,350
There's a good reason for this.

28
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,655
Man is a combination...

29

Hell, he's been coaching Karen on
how to talk to this psycho. He won't mind.

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,279
How much?

35
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,195
How much for a half and half?

36
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,192
Sorry, but excuse me.

37
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,829
Excuse me.

Jesus.

00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,472
- Did Karen see this?
- Yeah.

41
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,807
Oh, shit.

42
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,572
She never even mentioned
seeing the victims.

43
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,550
She didn't want you to worry.

44
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,349
I'm worried.

45
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,666
Okay, guys, this is the jackpot.

- I don't like the interference.
- It's the best rig we got.

49
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,383
No, it's all that neon out there.
It messes up the signal.

50
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,910
I'll get our people to cruise Western.

51
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,785
Boy, there's a lot of
flotsam and jetsam out tonight, ain't there?

52
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,925
Seems like there's more of them
every time I get out here.

53
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,690
I wonder where they come from,
where they're going to.

54
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:30,558
I don't know where they're from,
but they got to where they're going.

She's wearing a purple and lavender outfit.
We'll be able to spot her pretty easy.

59
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,643
Yeah, I've seen her on the news.

I'll need a few more minutes.

Jesus, there's a guy standing
right outside the booth now.

I don't know if it's him or not.

00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,560
So how is it going?

- What?

91
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,302
I'm afraid we might've lost her.

Lost her?

Okay, mister, it's all yours.

You said you'd never be out of contact.
What kind of operation are you running?

97

I'll keep the transmitter open.

- Can I turn around and see you?
- Not yet, Karen.

103
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,871
Just watch.

104
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,476

She didn't feel a thing, Karen.
None of them do.

They're not real, the people here.
They're dead.

There's a broad that came in here.
She emptied the place out.

00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:17,444
I didn't even see him.

156
00:14:17,521 --> 00:14:20,615
I turned around, but I didn't see him.

157
00:14:44,148 --> 00:14:46,878
- It's Number 27, down the hall.
- Thank you.

158
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:50,086
Did the guy say anything else?

159
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:54,791
He just said he worked with a kid
named Eddie, that he thought lived here.

160
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,156
- He did say the kid hated washing dishes.
- Who doesn't?

161
00:14:59,363 --> 00:15:00,489
Here we go.

162
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:12,833
Charming.

163
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:21,840
Oh, God.

164
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,584
It's just your average, red-blooded,
all-American boy.

165
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:41,702
Get out of here!

166
00:15:46,477 --> 00:15:49,071
Boy, Doc's gonna have a field day
with these.

167
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:52,275
Karen.

168
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:54,245
Look at this.

169
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,684
Not bad. The kid had talent.

170
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:04,185
He could've designed
the Marquis de Sade coloring book.

171
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:27,708
I think we better call the cops.

172
00:16:28,185 --> 00:16:29,311
Eventually.

173
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:31,315
Look at this.

174
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:38,420
I wonder if this is a real place.

175
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,563
So what's the story
on our next Norman Rockwell?

176
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:46,926
This sort of person is controlled
by the right hemisphere of the brain.

177
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:51,439
That dominates the non-rational...

178
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:53,970
the artistic, the creative impulses.

179
00:16:55,746 --> 00:16:59,147
It's not unusual
for a killer to draw as well as that.

180
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,947
It's not a bad angle, Doc.
Do you mind putting that on tape for us?

181
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,112
Not at all.

182
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:08,317
We're pushing Fred for a half-hour special
called <i>The Mind of Eddie Quist...</i>

183
00:17:08,392 --> 00:17:11,259
although we're focusing, really,
on the beast in all of us.

184
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:12,454
Good idea.

185
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:15,361
- So you found the last name?
- He signed his work.

186
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,162
So he did.

187
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:26,774
I'm sorry.

188
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:31,640
I guess I'm just not quite ready yet, okay?

189
00:17:32,716 --> 00:17:34,013
You'll be okay.

190
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,079
Don't worry.

191
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:50,393
<i>Stand by, Cameras 1 and 2.</i>

192
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:53,493
<i>- Then I'm on the air.</i>
- 2, push on in.

193
00:17:54,171 --> 00:17:56,366
Are you sure you're up to this?

194
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,035
- Nothing like diving in head first.
- That's what the old man says.

195
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,609
Here's our girl.

196
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:07,945
We're gonna make ratings history tonight.
You'll be the cynosure of all eyes.

197
00:18:08,018 --> 00:18:10,543
That means everybody
is going to be watching you.

198
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:13,920
Everybody wants to see
the lady who caught Eddie the Mangler.

199
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:16,084
Terrific. You have my copy?

200
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,952
Good luck.

201
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:21,120
- Boy, she seems shaky.
- Looks fine to me.

202
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:24,959
- We go in 10 seconds.
<i>- Don't let this be the last stop for your car.</i>

203
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:29,805
<i>- Keep your runabout running right...</i>
- Five, four, three<i>...</i>

204
00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:33,141
<i>This is KDHB TV, Channel 6, Los Angeles.</i>

205
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,300
Up on 2.

206

211
00:18:50,258 --> 00:18:52,726
Are the tapes on that train wreck ready?

212

<i>... 14 injured in train derailment.</i>
<i>More on the Mideast earthquake.</i>

216
00:19:13,014 --> 00:19:14,242
Good evening.

217
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:37,695
Get her out of there.

218
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:41,241
- Roll 7.
- Cue the editorial.

219
00:19:42,878 --> 00:19:46,473
<i>... proclaimed no immediate danger</i>
<i>to nearby residential areas.</i>

220
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,987
Let's pause now for an editorial
from our General Manager, Fred W. Francis.

221
00:19:53,555 --> 00:19:54,715
Here's Fred.

222
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:59,051
<i>In keeping with this station's pledge</i>
<i>of community involvement...</i>

<i>we present an editorial</i>
<i>from KDHB station manager, Fred Francis.</i>

224
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:08,293
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right. You need a little more time.

225
00:20:09,504 --> 00:20:13,565
<i>There's been a lot of talk in the past month</i>
<i>about our culture of violence.</i>

226
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:15,442
Who knows? Maybe she's pregnant.

227
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:19,139
Get in touch with Fujiama, Fujimoto,
or whatever the hell her name is...

228
00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:21,580
and get her ready for the 11:00 report.

229
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:24,280
Now there is a pro.

230
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,224
You can't be afraid of dreams.

231
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,124
I can't help it. All I remember...

232
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,859
is pushing open the door...

233
00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:40,934
and then I'm outside...

234
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:45,738
and the police are there, Bill's there,
and the remote crew, and it's over.

235
00:20:49,978 --> 00:20:53,744
There's blood on me, and I can't imagine
who it might have came from.

236
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:57,482
You can't remember
anything that happened inside the booth?

237
00:20:58,987 --> 00:21:00,978
No, not really.

238
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,088
Just weird little pieces in my dreams.

239
00:21:07,228 --> 00:21:08,718
How're you and Bill?

240
00:21:09,597 --> 00:21:11,155
Trying to communicate.

241
00:21:14,202 --> 00:21:17,968
- Tell me, Doctor, how crazy am I?
- Completely bananas.

242
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:19,998
I think so.

243
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:23,567
I recommend that you go out to the Colony
for a week or two.

244
00:21:24,412 --> 00:21:26,937
- Your place up north there?
- That's right.

245
00:21:27,015 --> 00:21:29,813
I only recommend it
to very special patients...

246
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:32,444
ones who I think will benefit
from its environment.

247
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,045
It's a place where you can
recharge your batteries.

248
00:21:35,123 --> 00:21:38,490
<i>It'll enable you to try and get back</i>
<i>to what you really are.</i>

249
00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:40,793
<i>What goes on up there?</i>

250
00:21:40,862 --> 00:21:44,764
<i>Seminars, group therapy. It's very low-key.</i>

251
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:48,294
<i>It'll be a good place</i>
<i>to try and tackle this amnesia thing.</i>

252
00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:52,266
I don't know if I want to remember.

253
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:54,130
What?

254
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:59,278
Doc said, once I remembered what
happened, it wouldn't scare me anymore.

255
00:21:59,347 --> 00:22:00,712
I'm not so sure.

256
00:22:01,616 --> 00:22:03,914
Honey, give this place a chance, okay?

257
00:22:04,686 --> 00:22:06,313
We've got to do something.

258
00:22:07,655 --> 00:22:09,919
I hope these people aren't too weird.

259
00:22:26,074 --> 00:22:27,735
Jerry Warren, softwares.

260
00:22:28,576 --> 00:22:30,305
Bill Neill, hardware.

261
00:22:30,545 --> 00:22:31,534
Hardware?

262
00:22:31,713 --> 00:22:33,112
He doesn't get it, Bill.

263
00:22:33,181 --> 00:22:36,673
I own a couple of health clubs, barbells,
hardware. This is my wife Karen.

264
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:38,616
Hi, nice to meet you.

265
00:22:38,686 --> 00:22:41,314
- Prime rib?
- No, I try to stay away from meat.

266
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:43,619
- Maybe later. Thank you.
- Thank you.

267
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:46,183
Did you see that meat?

268
00:22:48,229 --> 00:22:51,130
Oh, my God!
We watch you on the news all the time.

269
00:22:51,866 --> 00:22:53,493
You're our second favorite...

270
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:57,004
right behind<i>...</i>
What's the name of that Oriental girl, Jerry?

271
00:22:57,072 --> 00:22:58,903
This is my wife, Donna.

272
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:04,066
- Get me out of here, Bill.
- Looky here!

273
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:05,874
Welcome to the Colony!

274
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:09,648
Charlie Barton, Bill and Karen<i>...</i>

275
00:23:09,717 --> 00:23:11,685
- White.
- Neill.

276
00:23:11,753 --> 00:23:15,689
Charlie's on our board. He put up
all the cattle for tonight's barbecue.

277
00:23:16,024 --> 00:23:18,254
I seen you on television!

278
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:19,885
Thank you.

279
00:23:21,596 --> 00:23:24,292
If you fellows don't mind,
I'm going to borrow Karen...

280
00:23:24,365 --> 00:23:26,663
and give her the run-down on the Colony.

281
00:23:26,734 --> 00:23:28,929
- Don't leave out the juicy stuff.
- I won't.

282
00:23:29,003 --> 00:23:30,231
Come on.

283
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:33,933
- Let's get this boy some bacon.
- You say when now, Bill.

284
00:23:57,565 --> 00:23:59,157
Can't go on like this.

285
00:24:00,568 --> 00:24:02,058
Damn teeth are shot.

286
00:24:02,504 --> 00:24:03,801
Hell of a note.

287
00:24:14,315 --> 00:24:15,577
You want some?

288
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:17,741
Sure, why not?

289
00:24:19,053 --> 00:24:20,281
What's in it?

290
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:25,351
It's good.

291
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:27,950
I'm Bill.

292
00:24:28,663 --> 00:24:29,687
I know.

293
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:34,158
I'm looking for my wife.

294
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:39,197
Why?

295
00:24:44,946 --> 00:24:46,038
Excuse me.

296
00:24:53,755 --> 00:24:56,485
...opening up and letting it all come out.

297
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:59,288
I've found parts of me
I didn't even know existed.

298
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,887
Now you can see why I brought you here.
You won't be cold here.

299
00:25:03,464 --> 00:25:07,525
- Speaking of cold, how is your bungalow?
- It's quite nice, thanks.

300
00:25:07,602 --> 00:25:09,832
- We're neighbors.
- You are?

301
00:25:11,206 --> 00:25:14,835
Tell me something else.
Do you miss the television?

302
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,876
Are you kidding?
I don't have to pin my hair up.

303
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:18,240
Are you kidding?
I don't have to pin my hair up.

304
00:25:26,551 --> 00:25:28,746
Hello, Marsha. How are you?

305
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,419
Take this book back.
I don't want my brother reading it.

306
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,258
I think he said he'd like to.

307
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,954
You've done enough damage already.

308
00:25:47,572 --> 00:25:49,506
- Bitch.
- No.

309
00:25:50,108 --> 00:25:52,599
We can all learn a great deal from Marsha.

310
00:25:53,144 --> 00:25:55,078
She's a very elemental person.

311
00:25:55,647 --> 00:25:57,547
It's all that natural energy.

312
00:25:58,249 --> 00:25:59,773
She's a nymphomaniac.

313
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:06,054
It's just that it's so unchanneled.

314
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:09,187
She has a long way to go.

315
00:27:08,953 --> 00:27:11,387
Let me go! I want to end it!

316
00:27:11,456 --> 00:27:13,083
Easy, buddy, just calm down.

317
00:27:13,157 --> 00:27:15,921
This is the only way.
I got to end it, I got to burn!

318
00:27:15,994 --> 00:27:18,360
Calm down. Think a minute.

319
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:21,190
You got to let me do it, Doc.

320
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:24,165
- Jesus.
- Don't worry.

321
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,205
That's one of Erle's favorite tricks.
He's just trying to get attention.

322
00:27:29,374 --> 00:27:32,639
I want to end it. It just goes on and on.

323
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,507
You know better than that.

324
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:37,673
The old man shouldn't drink.
It really gets him loose.

325
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,314
Believe me, come tomorrow...

326
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,750
people will be so pleased
to see that you're safe and sound...

327
00:27:44,822 --> 00:27:46,847
they won't think anything more of it.

328
00:27:46,924 --> 00:27:48,789
You get a good night's sleep.

329
00:27:48,993 --> 00:27:51,723
Everything will seem better
in the light of day.

330
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:54,158
There, now.

331
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,135
Bill, wake up, there's something out there!

332
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:11,198
Outside. Something was howling.

333
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:17,206
- Listen.
- The wind.

334
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,511
There was something howling before.

335
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:23,816
Okay, sure. Somebody's dog.

336
00:29:24,655 --> 00:29:26,680
Not like any dog I ever heard.

337
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:28,781
Honey, you were raised in L.A.

338
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,192
The wildest thing you ever heard
was Wolfman Jack.

339
00:29:31,262 --> 00:29:32,752
This is the country.

340
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,458
Come on, let's try to get some sleep, okay?

341
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:38,724
Good.

342
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:20,869
You heard something outside.
Why shouldn't you call the police?

343
00:31:22,437 --> 00:31:25,304
I'm embarrassed.
I wish we hadn't even called them.

344
00:31:25,373 --> 00:31:28,706
Look at this!
All the balls on my side of the court again.

345
00:31:29,277 --> 00:31:31,905
What you ladies need is a good retriever.

346
00:31:35,149 --> 00:31:39,085
Doc said on the phone that you folks
had a coyote problem out here.

347
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,114
- You're famous, ain't you?
- Sort of.

348
00:31:42,223 --> 00:31:45,283
Sam, this is Karen White.
Karen, Sam Newfield.

349
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,727
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- I used to watch you all the time.

350
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,690
You're prettier than Walter Cronkite.

351
00:31:51,766 --> 00:31:55,600
Karen thought she saw something moving
in the bushes last night.

352
00:31:56,204 --> 00:32:00,607
Coyotes is liable to come into a setup
like this to look for garbage.

353
00:32:01,142 --> 00:32:02,973
- Did you hear anything?
- Me?

354
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:05,505
I sleep like the dead.

355
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:09,717
Tattoo? I don't remember one on him
when he came in.

356
00:32:10,084 --> 00:32:11,381
The coroner<i>...</i>

357
00:32:11,653 --> 00:32:14,178
The coroner said
that he had one on his shoulder.

358
00:32:14,255 --> 00:32:16,815
Some kind of animal head, right there.

359
00:32:18,126 --> 00:32:20,651
I don't get many of you TV people in here.

360
00:32:20,728 --> 00:32:24,494
Mostly it's the newspaper guys
who like to come in, look at the meat.

361
00:32:24,699 --> 00:32:26,826
I don't know how you can stand it.

362
00:32:27,135 --> 00:32:29,695
Doesn't bother me.
Want to unwrap him, Ross?

363
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:34,606
Let's see, Quist is still with the John Does.
We haven't had time to re-file him.

364
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:37,637
Only thing that freaked me out
since working here...

365
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:39,509
is the night old Stu Walker came in.

366
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:43,448
The guy who worked here.
I say goodnight to him at the shift change...

367
00:32:43,518 --> 00:32:47,284
a couple hours go by, then we get a delivery
from the Oceanside unit.

368
00:32:47,422 --> 00:32:48,821
I unzip the bag.

369
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:52,949
There's old Stu, smiling up at me,
leaking sea water out his ears.

370
00:32:54,095 --> 00:32:55,460
Visitors, Eddie!

371
00:32:57,565 --> 00:32:58,725
Where is he?

372
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:01,296
He was here this morning.

373
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,662
God! Look at the door.

374
00:33:05,006 --> 00:33:07,566
You don't suppose somebody
could have stolen him, do you?

375
00:33:07,642 --> 00:33:10,110
He didn't get up and walk out on his own.

376
00:33:17,986 --> 00:33:19,681
There're cows around here?

377
00:33:20,221 --> 00:33:23,987
Charlie Barton's got a couple of acres
of pasture just down the hill.

378
00:33:26,761 --> 00:33:28,388
They don't sound right.

379
00:33:29,697 --> 00:33:32,598
I'm not really sure
how cows are supposed to sound.

380
00:33:35,069 --> 00:33:36,331
Not like that.

381
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,633
Jerry's got a rifle, doesn't he?

382
00:33:44,245 --> 00:33:47,009
Haven't you done assertiveness training?

383
00:33:48,816 --> 00:33:51,410
Before I hooked into Doc, I did it all.

384
00:33:52,086 --> 00:33:55,487
I did EST, TM, Scientology...

385
00:33:55,556 --> 00:33:57,922
iridology, primal screamers.

386
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,161
I don't know. I figure
another five years of real hard work...

387
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,255
and maybe I'll be a human being.

388
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:07,991
I don't see nothing.

389
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,736
I didn't hear anything so funny anyway.

390
00:34:13,841 --> 00:34:15,968
- Oh, Jesus!
- Christ!

391
00:34:19,781 --> 00:34:21,476
- Now what?
- What's wrong?

392
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:24,051
- Great!
- What's wrong?

393
00:34:24,452 --> 00:34:27,444
- What's wrong?
- Let me look at it. Let me see.

394
00:34:29,223 --> 00:34:31,589
Here. I can tell about batteries.

395
00:34:33,728 --> 00:34:38,324
God, Donna. Now we're stuck out here
in the middle of Timbuktu someplace!

396
00:34:40,268 --> 00:34:41,997
- Watch that gun.
- God!

397
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,903
Sorry to scare you, ma'am.
I thought you was a cowjacker.

398
00:34:44,972 --> 00:34:47,839
There's another one back up yonder,
tore up the same way.

399
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:51,436
- You know what did it?
- It ain't a coyote, that's a cinch.

400
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,010
You girls all right?

401
00:34:54,182 --> 00:34:56,650
Nothing like a quiet week in the country.

402
00:34:59,754 --> 00:35:01,244
A little straighter.

403
00:35:02,323 --> 00:35:05,053
All right, now the quick shot again.
Think fast.

404
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:08,690
You have potential, Bill.

405
00:35:09,564 --> 00:35:11,930
I think you're ready for your bullets.

406
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,362
Don't you guys usually use a dog
in this kind of hunt?

407
00:35:15,436 --> 00:35:18,303
Usually. But these clowns
would shoot all of them.

408
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,201
Besides, who needs dogs? We got T.C.

409
00:35:22,877 --> 00:35:24,674
That boy's part bloodhound.

410
00:35:25,046 --> 00:35:29,107
I still think it was UFOs,
them cattle mutilations.

411
00:35:29,183 --> 00:35:33,313
Good, Erle. You watch the skies for us now.
That'll be your job.

412
00:35:33,387 --> 00:35:36,515
- I want to talk to you.
- I thought you had a session.

413
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:40,118
I do. But I don't want you to go do this,
not just for my sake.

414
00:35:40,194 --> 00:35:41,559
Are you kidding?

415
00:35:43,564 --> 00:35:47,762
- I've never been on a wolf hunt before.
- This is a wolf hunt, not a coot show.

416
00:35:48,169 --> 00:35:50,501
The boys are calling me.
Do you see the boys?

417
00:36:25,373 --> 00:36:27,102
<i>What happened then, Karen?</i>

418
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:29,367
I hear something else.

419
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,643
Somebody else is breathing,
he's in there with me.

420
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:36,450
It's Eddie, and he closes the door.

421
00:36:36,951 --> 00:36:39,112
And he puts a quarter into the slot.

422
00:36:39,654 --> 00:36:41,588
And the movie starts.

423
00:36:43,491 --> 00:36:46,085
And then he whispers something to me.

424
00:36:49,564 --> 00:36:52,431
He whispers something to me,
and then he tells me...

425
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:55,425
I can finally turn around and look at him.

426
00:36:55,603 --> 00:36:57,070
Turn around, Karen.

427
00:36:57,572 --> 00:36:58,937
What do you see?

428
00:37:00,374 --> 00:37:01,864
What's there, Karen?

429
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:05,138
- What do you see?
- What's there?

430
00:37:05,646 --> 00:37:08,513
- I can't see him.
- Just try. He's right there.

431
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:10,676
- What do you see?
- What's there?

432
00:37:14,522 --> 00:37:16,888
I can't see him! I can't.

433
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:20,154
Okay. That's far enough for now.

434
00:37:22,897 --> 00:37:23,989
I'm sorry.

435
00:37:34,908 --> 00:37:36,500
I got him. First shot.

436
00:37:38,544 --> 00:37:40,569
And he said he wasn't no hunter.

437
00:38:02,669 --> 00:38:03,966
We get 'em all:

438
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:07,830
sun worshippers,
moon worshippers, Satanists.

439
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:10,905
The Manson people
used to hang around here and shoplift.

440
00:38:10,977 --> 00:38:12,171
Bunch of deadbeats.

441
00:38:12,245 --> 00:38:15,408
Do you know of any groups
that are into stealing corpses?

442
00:38:15,481 --> 00:38:16,778
Body snatching?

443
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:20,683
If you want to read about it, I've got a book.
Slide me down.

444
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:24,278
Hold it.

445
00:38:25,725 --> 00:38:27,852
You name it, I've got the book.

446
00:38:28,428 --> 00:38:31,397
<i>"</i>A number of young women
were killed in the next month...

447
00:38:31,464 --> 00:38:34,490
<i>"</i>their bodies exhibiting signs
of animal attack<i>."</i>

448
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:36,161
What's that?

449
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,329
<i>Warlocks, Werewolves and Demons.</i>

450
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:50,848
If you're going to purchase, purchase.
If not, leave them. You'll get them greasy.

451
00:38:51,117 --> 00:38:53,984
We'll find out if any of Eddie's killings
were on a full moon.

452
00:38:54,053 --> 00:38:55,987
That's a lot of Hollywood baloney.

453
00:38:56,055 --> 00:38:59,513
Your classic werewolf can change shape
any time it wants, day or night.

454
00:38:59,592 --> 00:39:02,993
That's why they're called shape-shifters.
I've got a dozen books on it.

455
00:39:03,062 --> 00:39:06,623
- What about killing it with silver bullets?
- Sure, silver bullets or fire.

456
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:10,191
It's the only way to get rid of them.
They're worse than cockroaches.

457
00:39:10,269 --> 00:39:12,931
They come back from the dead
if you don't kill them right.

458
00:39:13,006 --> 00:39:14,337
Plus, they regenerate.

459
00:39:14,407 --> 00:39:17,103
Cut off an arm or leg,
stick a knife in the heart. Nothing.

460
00:39:17,176 --> 00:39:20,009
They look dead,
but three days later, they're as good as new.

461
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,843
- Do you believe in this?
- What am I, an idiot?

462
00:39:22,915 --> 00:39:25,247
I'm making a buck here.
You want books, I got books.

463
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:28,412
I got chicken blood, I got dog embryos,
black candles, wolfsbane.

464
00:39:28,488 --> 00:39:30,683
Look at this, silver bullets.

465
00:39:30,823 --> 00:39:33,724
Some joker ordered them.
.30-06. Never picked them up.

466
00:39:34,761 --> 00:39:37,093
I take BankAmericard,
American Express, Visa.

467
00:39:37,163 --> 00:39:39,791
- You gonna buy that or what?
- Yeah, these two.

468
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:44,466
- There's some incredible old pictures here.
- That's a good book.

469
00:39:48,674 --> 00:39:50,301
Did you see any wolves?

470
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,544
Nope. Just lots of rabbits.

471
00:39:53,212 --> 00:39:55,806
- What do you do with these things?
- Eat 'em.

472
00:39:57,316 --> 00:40:00,046
My sister will cook it up for you, if you want.

473
00:40:00,353 --> 00:40:02,446
No, I try to stay away from meat.

474
00:40:02,822 --> 00:40:04,346
Your wife might like it.

475
00:40:04,424 --> 00:40:07,325
You kill something you don't eat.
Now, that's a sin.

476
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:10,552
I never thought of it like that.

477
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,621
Our place is just over there.

478
00:40:12,698 --> 00:40:15,326
My sister would be glad
to cook it up for you.

479
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,498
Are you sure?

480
00:40:18,738 --> 00:40:20,501
Marsha just loves to cook.

481
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:31,811
Are you sure?

482
00:40:59,112 --> 00:41:00,704
How long will it take?

483
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:06,785
I'll cook it later.

484
00:42:54,427 --> 00:42:57,453
It happened so fast
that I didn't even see what it was.

485
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:01,091
- Jesus, Doc, is that necessary?
- Can't take any chances.

486
00:43:02,702 --> 00:43:03,691
God!

487
00:43:05,538 --> 00:43:06,937
I want to go home.

488
00:43:07,807 --> 00:43:10,298
I wouldn't advise traveling right now.

489
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,076
A bite like that can be pretty serious.

490
00:43:16,745 --> 00:43:20,738
<i>- Yes, that's the sign of the werewolf.</i>
<i>- That's just a legend though, isn't it?</i>

491
00:43:20,816 --> 00:43:23,717
<i>Yes, but like most legends,</i>
<i>it must have some basis in fact.</i>

492
00:43:23,786 --> 00:43:27,688
<i>Probably an ancient explanation</i>
<i>of the dual personality in each of us.</i>

493
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:29,320
<i>How does it go?</i>

494
00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:33,428
<i>"Even a man pure in heart</i>
<i>and says his prayers by night...</i>

495
00:43:33,495 --> 00:43:36,487
<i>"may become a wolf</i>
<i>when the wolfsbane blooms...</i>

496
00:43:36,598 --> 00:43:38,623
<i>"and the autumn moon is bright."</i>

497
00:43:39,068 --> 00:43:40,968
You're reading. I'll get it.

498
00:43:41,971 --> 00:43:45,372
- Who's calling at 11:30?
- It's my phone, I'll get it.

499
00:43:45,975 --> 00:43:47,135
I'll get it.

500
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:49,803
- You want me to get it?
- You get it!

501
00:43:56,385 --> 00:43:57,852
No, we're still up.

502
00:43:58,687 --> 00:43:59,676
What?

503
00:44:01,156 --> 00:44:04,819
You're kidding me.
No, listen, we'll come right up, okay?

504
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:07,855
We'll be right up. Just calm down.

505
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:10,122
Okay. Bye-bye.

506
00:44:10,632 --> 00:44:11,758
What is it?

507
00:44:13,002 --> 00:44:14,993
Bill just got bitten by a wolf.

508
00:44:16,338 --> 00:44:19,205
<i>... whoever is bitten</i>
<i>by a werewolf and lives...</i>

509
00:44:19,441 --> 00:44:21,341
<i>becomes a werewolf himself.</i>

510
00:44:22,444 --> 00:44:24,674
<i>Come on, Terry, it's only a movie.</i>

511
00:44:25,347 --> 00:44:29,215
<i>You go on ahead and I'll be up as soon as</i>
<i>I pitch the special to the old man.</i>

512
00:44:29,284 --> 00:44:32,253
<i>Relax, will you?</i>
<i>It was probably just some stray dog.</i>

513
00:44:32,955 --> 00:44:34,820
- Hello, good friend.
- Hello.

514
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,152
How are you?

515
00:44:36,225 --> 00:44:37,453
Are you okay?

516
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:43,622
I don't know what her last name is.
Donna calls her Marsha the Man-Eater.

517
00:44:44,633 --> 00:44:47,431
And she lives in this shack...

518
00:44:47,803 --> 00:44:50,636
with these furry little animals
hanging from the rafters.

519
00:44:50,806 --> 00:44:53,741
You think she's trying
to make the move on Bill?

520
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:56,502
I don't know. It's just a feeling.

521
00:44:57,413 --> 00:44:59,142
I sound paranoid, don't I?

522
00:45:02,017 --> 00:45:03,882
Karen, you sound fine.

523
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:09,280
God, no veggies.
I totally forgot about Bill and his dinner.

524
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:14,295
Bill, I'm really sorry.
I totally forgot about you not eating meat.

525
00:45:14,696 --> 00:45:16,926
No sweat. It's terrific.

526
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:20,264
No, really. I get hungry enough,
I'll eat anything.

527
00:45:41,957 --> 00:45:43,857
Give me this book here.

528
00:45:46,428 --> 00:45:48,828
I just thought maybe we'd<i>...</i>

529
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:52,124
Your timing is incredible.

530
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:56,501
Sorry, honey. Those shots are...

531
00:46:02,077 --> 00:46:04,170
We're just out of sync, aren't we?

532
00:46:04,413 --> 00:46:07,143
We never want the same thing
at the same time.

533
00:46:12,821 --> 00:46:14,448
Goodnight, Bill.

534
00:46:34,343 --> 00:46:37,403
<i>Turn around, Karen.</i>

535
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:42,317
<i>What do you see?</i>

536
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:45,182
<i>Can you see anything?</i>

537
00:46:47,856 --> 00:46:49,323
Bill, it's<i>...</i>

538
00:46:53,662 --> 00:46:55,254
Screw you, then.

539
00:52:09,641 --> 00:52:10,801
Jesus.

540
00:53:33,892 --> 00:53:35,553
<i>Over here, Terry.</i>

541
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,410
Hello?

542
00:55:42,287 --> 00:55:43,754
Anybody here?

543
00:58:28,616 --> 00:58:29,844
Oh, God!

544
00:58:48,936 --> 00:58:50,164
Oh, God!

545
00:59:23,337 --> 00:59:24,395
No!

546
01:00:39,247 --> 01:00:41,044
Come on, Christopher.

547
01:00:46,754 --> 01:00:49,746
Christopher, you're not
going to believe this.

548
01:00:58,132 --> 01:00:59,895
I'm in the bathroom.

549
01:01:02,837 --> 01:01:04,737
I had that dream again.

550
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:07,673
This time I think you were in it.

551
01:01:08,176 --> 01:01:10,736
No wonder, honey.
You've been asleep all day.

552
01:01:10,812 --> 01:01:14,248
Jesus, where did you get
those scratches on your back?

553
01:01:16,217 --> 01:01:19,778
I guess they're from the other night,
when I got attacked.

554
01:01:19,954 --> 01:01:22,479
They weren't there the other night.

555
01:01:23,658 --> 01:01:26,286
Karen, you're really getting paranoid.

556
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:33,323
- You've been with her, that Marsha girl?
- Don't lay your fantasies out on me.

557
01:01:33,401 --> 01:01:36,893
- I'm not gonna take that...
- I know, it's all a big conspiracy...

558
01:01:36,971 --> 01:01:41,908
You don't have one inch of backbone!
She walks by you like a bitch in heat...

559
01:01:46,547 --> 01:01:48,105
Don't touch me.

560
01:01:58,392 --> 01:02:00,883
I'm going over to Doc's and call Chris.

561
01:02:00,962 --> 01:02:04,796
He'll come pick Terry and me up.
You can do whatever you want.

562
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:08,657
- You don't know what it's like.
- I don't want to know.

563
01:02:15,576 --> 01:02:17,510
<i>... and Eddie Quist, he lives...</i>

564
01:02:17,578 --> 01:02:21,309
Calm down. You're not making any sense.
Eddie Quist is dead.

565
01:02:21,682 --> 01:02:24,617
I saw pictures just like we saw in his room.

566
01:02:25,019 --> 01:02:27,544
Christopher, the landscape...

567
01:02:28,656 --> 01:02:30,624
it's here at the Colony.

568
01:02:31,893 --> 01:02:33,224
It's real.

569
01:02:34,262 --> 01:02:36,628
- Where are you, at Doc's?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

570
01:02:38,132 --> 01:02:40,726
Christopher, I'll tell you something.

571
01:02:41,636 --> 01:02:44,264
I think he's got to be a part of this.

572
01:02:45,539 --> 01:02:48,337
Is there some kind of file cabinet there?

573
01:02:50,645 --> 01:02:52,909
<i>Are you sure you're all right?</i>

574
01:02:53,247 --> 01:02:55,545
Yeah, I'm okay.

575
01:02:56,317 --> 01:02:58,808
It sure is good to hear your voice.

576
01:02:59,754 --> 01:03:02,086
Look in the files under <i>"</i>Quist<i>."</i>

577
01:03:03,891 --> 01:03:05,791
You won't hang up, will you?

578
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:10,092
I'll get the police there as soon as I can.
Just go look in the file.

579
01:03:10,598 --> 01:03:13,761
Okay, hold on.
Never mind, you're coming with me.

580
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,072
<i>"</i>Quist, Marsha<i>."</i>

581
01:03:30,384 --> 01:03:31,976
<i>"</i>Quist, T. C<i>."</i>

582
01:03:37,224 --> 01:03:39,692
It's Eddie Quist.

583
01:04:07,555 --> 01:04:10,854
Operator, get me
the County Sheriff's Department, quick!

584
01:04:30,076 --> 01:04:31,737
No, don't bother.

585
01:04:32,178 --> 01:04:36,581
I'll get hold of the state boys
and we'll meet you over at the center.

586
01:04:36,649 --> 01:04:39,948
I wouldn't worry, Mr. Halloran.
I'm sure she's safe.

587
01:05:34,407 --> 01:05:38,275
Those are real silver. I got to check
with a jeweler to find out what to charge!

588
01:05:38,344 --> 01:05:39,572
Bill me.

589
01:05:40,546 --> 01:05:41,911
Crazy fuck.

590
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,728
I got to use your phone.

591
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:01,523
Jesus Christ, what happened in here?

592
01:07:07,567 --> 01:07:09,364
- Hello, Karen.
- Eddie.

593
01:07:11,437 --> 01:07:13,098
I'm glad you came.

594
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:15,764
I wanted to see you again.

595
01:07:18,377 --> 01:07:19,867
I saw you die.

596
01:07:23,849 --> 01:07:27,376
You said on the phone
that you wanted to get to know me.

597
01:07:27,954 --> 01:07:29,581
Here I am, Karen.

598
01:07:30,456 --> 01:07:31,821
Look at me.

599
01:07:35,361 --> 01:07:38,023
I want to give you a piece of my mind.

600
01:07:39,365 --> 01:07:41,162
I trusted you, Karen.

601
01:11:06,003 --> 01:11:09,564
Take it easy, pal.
Not all of us got enough money for a Mazda.

602
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,801
Some of us have to work for a living.

603
01:11:11,876 --> 01:11:14,208
I'm in a hurry here. This is an emergency!

604
01:11:20,585 --> 01:11:24,282
Come on out of there now, miss.
We've been waiting for you.

605
01:11:42,573 --> 01:11:44,837
Took some persuading, did she?

606
01:12:55,112 --> 01:12:56,579
Where's Bill?

607
01:12:57,281 --> 01:12:58,748
He's one of us now.

608
01:12:58,816 --> 01:13:02,252
In time, he would have brought you
over to us. Our secret will be safe.

609
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,185
It's wonderful, Karen.

610
01:13:04,355 --> 01:13:06,949
When I was first bitten, I fought against it.

611
01:13:07,024 --> 01:13:10,084
So did Jerry. And then we found the doctor.

612
01:13:10,461 --> 01:13:13,225
He helped us. He helped us to adjust.

613
01:13:13,397 --> 01:13:16,594
You see, Karen,
he understands all about the gift.

614
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:20,765
He knows how to use it, how to control it.

615
01:13:21,138 --> 01:13:24,596
You'd have Bill back.
There's still time if you accept the gift.

616
01:13:24,675 --> 01:13:26,939
It was a mistake to bring her to the Colony.

617
01:13:27,011 --> 01:13:29,377
We should have stuck with the old ways.

618
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:32,678
Raising cattle for our feed.
Where's the life in that?

619
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:36,345
- Humans are our cattle.
- Humans are our prey.

620
01:13:36,754 --> 01:13:39,518
We should feed on them,
like we've always done.

621
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:42,525
Screw all this <i>"</i>Channel your energies<i>"</i> crap.

622
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:44,920
But the danger of exposure<i>...</i>

623
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:50,160
We need this shelter to plan,
to catch up with society.

624
01:13:50,901 --> 01:13:54,632
Times have changed and we haven't.
Not enough.

625
01:13:54,705 --> 01:13:56,172
Shut up, Doc!

626
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:02,806
You wouldn't listen to me. None of you.

627
01:14:05,883 --> 01:14:07,908
<i>"</i>We can fit in,<i>"</i> you said.

628
01:14:08,786 --> 01:14:10,686
<i>"</i>We can live with them<i>."</i>

629
01:14:11,522 --> 01:14:13,683
You make me sick.

630
01:14:14,258 --> 01:14:16,089
You're through, Doc.

631
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:18,518
She's ours now.

632
01:14:36,714 --> 01:14:40,548
See what your friend did to me that night?

633
01:14:41,118 --> 01:14:45,316
What's the matter with you all? Have you
forgotten everything you've learned?

634
01:14:45,389 --> 01:14:47,516
She can't disappear. She's well-known.

635
01:14:47,591 --> 01:14:50,253
Right, we've got to make this
look like an accident.

636
01:14:50,328 --> 01:14:52,125
I won't let you do this.

637
01:14:58,936 --> 01:15:02,997
You can't tame what's meant to be wild.
It ain't natural.

638
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:10,609
<i>Violence is part of the human condition,</i>
<i>as history shows us.</i>

639
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:15,250
<i>Coping with that fact,</i>
<i>living with it, presents each of us...</i>

640
01:15:17,288 --> 01:15:21,850
<i>Fortunately, most of us are able</i>
<i>to deal constructively with those choices.</i>

641
01:15:22,293 --> 01:15:25,387
<i>But for others, the animal lure of mayhem...</i>

642
01:15:25,863 --> 01:15:28,957
<i>the physical sensation</i>
<i>of life-and-death struggle...</i>

643
01:15:29,033 --> 01:15:30,933
<i>produces gratification.</i>

644
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:34,164
<i>According to the autopsy reports,</i>
<i>Eddie's victims were bitten...</i>

645
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:37,105
<i>almost as if</i>
<i>they had been attacked by an animal.</i>

646
01:15:37,174 --> 01:15:39,540
<i>Doctor, what can you tell me</i>
<i>about lycanthropy?</i>

647
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:41,840
<i>Where did you learn that term?</i>

648
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:45,075
<i>- On the</i> Late Late Show.
<i>- It's a mental disorder.</i>

649
01:15:45,149 --> 01:15:49,347
<i>There are dozens of cases.</i>
<i>People like to walk about on all fours...</i>

650
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:53,584
<i>to make bestial groans and sighs.</i>
<i>They prefer to eat raw meat.</i>

651
01:15:53,891 --> 01:15:56,621
<i>That certainly seems like</i>
<i>an awfully big coincidence...</i>

652
01:15:56,694 --> 01:16:00,425
<i>Karen being attacked by someone</i>
<i>with this kind of delusion.</i>

653
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:13,341
<i>You're not going to believe this.</i>

654
01:16:14,178 --> 01:16:15,975
<i>I've been attacked...</i>

655
01:16:21,886 --> 01:16:23,513
Hello, brave boy.

656
01:16:25,756 --> 01:16:26,950
Eddie?

657
01:16:28,092 --> 01:16:31,186
You know me, and I don't know you.

658
01:16:31,695 --> 01:16:33,993
- Now why is that?
- Where is she?

659
01:16:34,665 --> 01:16:36,758
Why? Is she your girlfriend?

660
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:39,159
Where's Terry?

661
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:42,962
Just down at the ritual center,
down the path.

662
01:16:43,841 --> 01:16:46,332
That's where Waggner sends us to...

663
01:16:47,178 --> 01:16:49,245
unwind.

664
01:16:49,378 --> 01:16:52,575
- He's so repressed.
- What did you do to her?

665
01:16:54,383 --> 01:16:56,317
She's got a sexy voice.

666
01:16:57,186 --> 01:16:59,586
I like a woman with a sexy voice.

667
01:17:03,826 --> 01:17:05,817
Listen to this part here.

668
01:17:06,829 --> 01:17:08,353
You are crazy.

669
01:17:10,132 --> 01:17:12,692
I'm much more than that, bright boy.

670
01:17:12,935 --> 01:17:14,425
I'm much more.

671
01:17:16,305 --> 01:17:17,397
Here.

672
01:17:18,307 --> 01:17:19,535
Take it.

673
01:17:22,278 --> 01:17:23,802
Call it a gift.

674
01:17:27,349 --> 01:17:29,112
Come on, bright boy.

675
01:17:32,788 --> 01:17:34,756
Don't you know anything?

676
01:17:51,473 --> 01:17:53,373
Put her and her friend in the car...

677
01:17:53,442 --> 01:17:58,072
pour gasoline over them, set fire to them,
and push them off the Coast Road.

678
01:18:02,151 --> 01:18:04,346
Chris, run! They'll kill you!

679
01:18:04,653 --> 01:18:07,349
That gun won't do you any good, mister.

680
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,225
Don't come any closer.

681
01:18:53,068 --> 01:18:54,899
I have silver bullets in here.

682
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:57,530
Silver bullets, my ass.

683
01:18:58,507 --> 01:18:59,872
Get up, T.C.

684
01:19:10,786 --> 01:19:12,253
They're real.

685
01:19:18,193 --> 01:19:21,026
Don't come any closer, Doc, please.

686
01:19:30,773 --> 01:19:32,104
Thank God!

687
01:19:46,588 --> 01:19:48,351
Karen, get the door!

688
01:19:51,193 --> 01:19:52,683
Take the rifle.

689
01:20:01,103 --> 01:20:02,331
Come on!

690
01:20:04,807 --> 01:20:08,265
- Is that the only door in the barn?
- Yeah, I think so.

691
01:20:10,512 --> 01:20:13,003
- Where's Terry?
- They killed her.

692
01:20:13,315 --> 01:20:14,942
And I think Bill.

693
01:21:15,611 --> 01:21:16,942
Take this.

694
01:21:24,686 --> 01:21:26,210
Get it started!

695
01:21:45,407 --> 01:21:48,843
- How'd you find out about them?
- Terry called, right after...

696
01:21:48,911 --> 01:21:50,742
Stop, it's Sam.

697
01:21:59,855 --> 01:22:00,947
Duck!

698
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:21,338
I smell gas. Come on.

699
01:22:30,185 --> 01:22:31,675
Give it to me.

700
01:22:35,123 --> 01:22:36,351
Come on!

701
01:22:46,134 --> 01:22:47,624
Lock the door!

702
01:23:14,027 --> 01:23:15,051
Go!

703
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:47,222
We have to warn people, Chris.

704
01:23:47,527 --> 01:23:49,722
We have to make them believe.

705
01:24:02,108 --> 01:24:04,736
There! I'm an artist. You look terrific!

706
01:24:05,612 --> 01:24:07,375
I know you are. Thanks.

707
01:24:07,947 --> 01:24:10,438
If you're done, Fran, thanks a lot.

708
01:24:20,794 --> 01:24:23,888
- I'm not sure I can go through with this.
- You have to.

709
01:24:23,963 --> 01:24:26,022
Okay, stand by on the set.

710
01:24:26,199 --> 01:24:29,566
Five, four, three, two<i>...</i>

711
01:24:30,637 --> 01:24:31,695
<i>Good evening.</i>

712
01:24:31,771 --> 01:24:35,366
<i>More word on that fire that's burning</i>
<i>out of control up the coast tonight.</i>

713
01:24:35,442 --> 01:24:39,435
<i>Firefighters have discovered the blaze</i>
<i>seems to have started at the Colony...</i>

714
01:24:39,512 --> 01:24:41,377
<i>an experimental living community...</i>

715
01:24:41,448 --> 01:24:44,645
<i>founded by author and behavior expert,</i>
<i>Dr. George Waggner.</i>

716
01:24:44,717 --> 01:24:46,014
She's ready.

717
01:24:46,086 --> 01:24:48,680
How does she look?
Does she look all right to you?

718
01:24:48,755 --> 01:24:51,588
<i>Reports so far indicate</i>
<i>that bodies have been discovered...</i>

719
01:24:51,658 --> 01:24:54,092
<i>both inside and outside</i>
<i>the Colony buildings...</i>

720
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,651
<i>many of them burned beyond recognition...</i>

721
01:24:56,729 --> 01:25:00,859
<i>in what authorities on the scene are calling</i>
<i>a Guyana-like spectacle.</i>

722
01:25:00,934 --> 01:25:05,030
<i>Now for an exclusive eyewitness report</i>
<i>on the incident, we welcome back...</i>

723
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:08,905
If she shows any sign of freezing,
like the last time, go right to commercial.

724
01:25:08,975 --> 01:25:10,237
Take one.

725
01:25:11,744 --> 01:25:13,211
Good evening.

726
01:25:15,715 --> 01:25:17,774
From the day we're born...

727
01:25:17,884 --> 01:25:19,681
there is a battle we must fight.

728
01:25:19,752 --> 01:25:23,586
<i>A struggle between</i>
<i>what is kind and peaceful in our natures...</i>

729
01:25:24,124 --> 01:25:26,251
<i>and what is cruel and violent.</i>

730
01:25:26,326 --> 01:25:28,226
What the hell is this, an editorial?

731
01:25:28,294 --> 01:25:30,660
That choice is our birthright
as human beings...

732
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:34,393
and the real gift
that differentiates us from the animals.

733
01:25:35,335 --> 01:25:37,701
<i>It is as natural to us as the air we breathe...</i>

734
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:40,898
Did you pass this material?
She's not reading from the prompter.

735
01:25:40,974 --> 01:25:42,908
We changed it a little bit.

736
01:25:43,042 --> 01:25:45,067
But now, for some of us...

737
01:25:45,545 --> 01:25:47,911
that choice has been taken away.

738
01:25:48,715 --> 01:25:50,774
A secret society exists...

739
01:25:51,584 --> 01:25:53,814
and is living among all of us.

740
01:25:55,922 --> 01:25:58,652
<i>They are neither people nor animals...</i>

741
01:25:58,725 --> 01:26:01,091
<i>but something in between.</i>

742
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:04,629
<i>Monstrous mutations,</i>
<i>whose violent natures...</i>

743
01:26:04,697 --> 01:26:07,461
- Ready one, take one.
<i>...must be satisfied.</i>

744
01:26:08,101 --> 01:26:11,901
<i>I know what you're thinking,</i>
<i>because I've been where you are...</i>

745
01:26:11,971 --> 01:26:13,905
- That's enough.
- Leave it.

746
01:26:13,973 --> 01:26:15,804
- Leave it? Cut!
- Leave it!

747
01:26:15,875 --> 01:26:17,570
But I have proof...

748
01:26:19,245 --> 01:26:22,078
and tonight I'm going to
show you something...

749
01:26:23,583 --> 01:26:25,346
to make you believe.

750
01:26:36,563 --> 01:26:38,428
Holy shit!

751
01:26:47,473 --> 01:26:48,940
What is this?

752
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:53,573
- What are you kids watching?
- The news lady's turned into a werewolf.

753
01:26:54,414 --> 01:26:55,642
Oh, boy!

754
01:27:21,241 --> 01:27:23,209
Switch, damn it!

755
01:27:26,212 --> 01:27:27,941
<i>Doesn't that look good?</i>

756
01:27:28,014 --> 01:27:31,882
<i>Tender, meaty chunks</i>
<i>of tantalizing nutrition...</i>

757
01:27:31,951 --> 01:27:34,613
Things they do with special effects
these days!

758
01:27:34,687 --> 01:27:37,155
Did you see the one
about the guy in the spaceship?

759
01:27:37,223 --> 01:27:38,520
It was real.

760
01:27:38,591 --> 01:27:41,583
She turned into a werewolf,
and they shot her.

761
01:27:42,962 --> 01:27:44,589
You're plastered!

762
01:27:45,331 --> 01:27:46,992
Doesn't mean it wasn't real.

763
01:27:47,066 --> 01:27:51,435
Ernie, put a pepper steak on for me,
and a hamburger for the lady.

764
01:27:51,504 --> 01:27:54,598
- How do you want that?
- How do you want it, honey?

765
01:27:58,211 --> 01:27:59,303
Rare.

766
01:30:25,425 --> 01:30:26,722
<i>Go now...</i>

767
01:30:27,493 --> 01:30:29,256
<i>and heaven help you.</i>
