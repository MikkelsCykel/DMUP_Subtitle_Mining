1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,333
I've been over and over this stuff.
It doesn't add up.

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:07,703
Who does these books? If I ran
my office this way, I'd be out of business.

3
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,376
What can we do?

4
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:16,880
I see places you could save,
but I can't make those choices.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,450
I'm not the president. I mean...

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,512
You know, I mean, I'm not the one
pretending to be the president.

7
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,020
I understand.

8
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:30,590
Let me try.

9
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:33,688
You?

10
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,695
Let me try.

11
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,263
You want to try?

12
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,433
All right. Here's something right here.

13
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:45,870
Look at that.

14
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,225
It's a work of art.

15
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,966
Look at this.
"Vice-president linked to S&L scandal."

16
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,906
Alan, you're a genius. We're on our way.

17
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,905
What's with the cameras?

18
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,342
Hundredth cabinet meeting.
It'll be a nice touch.

19
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,971
Oh, right.

20
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:28,477
Good morning, Mr. President.

21
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,084
How's everyone?

22
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,758
Before we get started...

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,765
...I'd like to go over the budget.

24
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,162
-Anything on the budget today?
-No, I don't think so.

25
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:53,241
I've found some ways to put back
the homeless section...

26
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,281
...of the Works Bill.

27
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:58,840
Mr. President, I don't believe
that's on your agenda today.

28
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,447
No, it's a last minute change, Bob.

29
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,921
Now, the way I see it,
we need $650 million in order to...

30
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,528
...keep the project.

31
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,859
Some of this can be done...

32
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,532
-...through some simple changes...
-It's all right.

33
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,538
...in our cash management.

34
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,306
For example...

35
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,465
...according to the OMB, we've got...

36
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:27,477
...17 defense contractors
who are delinquent in their contracts.

37
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,944
Is this true?

38
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,778
I believe so.

39
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,475
Even though...

40
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,821
...they're late,
we keep paying them on time?

41
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,521
Well, in a sense.

42
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,761
Okay, now...

43
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:48,065
...instead of paying them
for something they haven't finished...

44
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,365
...we could hold back that cash,
put it in an interest-bearing--

45
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,666
Mr. President.

46
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,739
Nothing.

47
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,412
Great.

48
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,487
Like I was saying, if we took that cash
and stuck it in a savings account...

49
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:15,755
...we'd be making
$23 million a month in interest.

50
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,422
Well, technically, that's true, but...

51
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,570
I suppose it's true.

52
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,369
Okay, so that's $23 million...

53
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,305
...times 12 months.

54
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:37,905
Good.

55
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,246
Fortunately, money management
gets us halfway to our goal.

56
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:48,390
In order to get the rest of the money,
we'll have to make some tough choices.

57
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,856
The Commerce Department.

58
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,997
Yes, Mr. President?

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,993
We're spending $47 million
on an ad campaign...

60
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,665
"...to boost consumer confidence
in the American auto industry."

61
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:07,405
It's designed to bolster
individual confidence...

62
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,743
...in a previous domestic
automotive purchase.

63
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,310
We're spending $47 million for somebody
to feel good about a car they bought?

64
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,486
I wouldn't categorize it that way.

65
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,923
I'm sure that's important, but...

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,119
...I don't want to tell an eight-year-old kid
he's gotta sleep in the street...

67
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:27,496
...because we want people
to feel better about their car.

68
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,765
Do you want to tell him that?

69
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,365
No, sir.

70
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,500
No, I sure don't.

71
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,380
Well then, that's another $47 million.

72
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,714
So this is good. Real good.
We're on our way.

73
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,346
Let me just add that to the tally here.

74
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,786
That'll be plus 47...

75
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,828
Five, carry the one...

76
00:04:56,896 --> 00:05:00,559
...makes $656 million...

77
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,295
...which means we can keep the program.

78
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,540
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you for your help.

79
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,224
Excuse me.

80
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,162
What is it?

81
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,566
You won't believe what your husband did.

82
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,410
I'll kill him.

83
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,607
You can't kill a president.

84
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,149
He's not a president.
He's an ordinary person.

85
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,082
I can kill an ordinary person.

86
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,581
I can kill 100 ordinary people.

87
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,154
He's only doing what you told him to.

88
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,692
What I told him to?

89
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:04,525
I heard you. You said,
"Cut $650 million off the budget...

90
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,191
-"...and you can keep your shelters."
-I didn't mean it.

91
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,860
Why would I want to save a shelter?

92
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,400
He was only doing his job!

93
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,929
His job? His job? It's not his job!
It's my job!

94
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,974
Will you calm down?

95
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,376
Was he on the Trilateral Commission?
Was he a senator?

96
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,643
Was he in "Who's Who"
nine years in a row?

97
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,274
Hello, Judy.

98
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,213
I'll destroy him. I'll shred him!
I'll lock him away.

99
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,450
Then we'll all go to jail together.

100
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,230
What do you mean by that?

101
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,910
What do you think I mean?

102
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,412
Are you threatening me?

103
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,411
Well...

104
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,751
Yeah.

105
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,748
I guess I am.

106
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,995
Thanks, Murray.

107
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,664
You did great.

108
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,731
Maybe you can come back.
We can go to Camp David.

109
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,341
Camp David?

110
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,442
Get out of here as fast as you can.

111
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,532
Come on, seven.

112
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,972
Come on, six.

113
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,720
We both lose.

114
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,655
We both lose.

115
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,896
I saw your light was on, so I...

116
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,233
Mind if I sit down?

117
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,400
Please.

118
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,669
Would you like...

119
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,011
No, thanks.

120
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,523
That was quite a thing you did today.

121
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,191
Anyone would've done that.

122
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,522
I don't think so.

123
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,264
You helped a lot of people.

124
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,368
You know...

125
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,770
...it kind of reminded me...

126
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:10,509
...of that thing you did a long time ago
in the state legislature.

127
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:15,913
Me, too.

128
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,721
You weren't in the state legislature.

129
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,927
Hi, I'm Ellen Mitchell.

130
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,795
Who're you?

131
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,634
I'll make this easy on you.

132
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,544
I never see him anymore.

133
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,246
I barely know him anymore.

134
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,914
I'd just kind of like to know where he is.

135
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,155
This could get me in trouble.

136
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,854
Open it, please, Duane.

137
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,998
Oh, my God!

138
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,497
I'm sorry, you're not allowed in here.

139
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,566
-We have strict instructions.
-I'll explain it later.

140
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,907
What happened?

141
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,744
It was a stroke.

142
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,339
It's pretty bad.

143
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,182
I don't understand.

144
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,258
Is he going to...

145
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,291
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,948
You're leaving?

147
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,447
I'm not the first lady anymore.

148
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,281
I shouldn't be here.

149
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,258
Where're you going?

150
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,554
Home.

151
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,362
Where's home?

152
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:22,339
Can we stop with the 20 questions?
I'm really not in the mood.

153
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,911
Souvenirs. Towels and stuff.

154
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,477
You're leaving, too?

155
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,317
I never wanted to hurt anybody.

156
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,423
I even thought I was helping.

157
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,347
You know...

158
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,957
...you make this little deal
with yourself that...

159
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,953
...you can put up
with all the other women and...

160
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,622
...you can even do without a life and...

161
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,233
...you can even do without children...

162
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,069
...because you believe
in what you're doing and think...

163
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,800
You thought you had a chance
to help people.

164
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,583
How are you gonna get home?

165
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,252
I don't know. I hadn't really...

166
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,820
...thought it out that far.

167
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,333
Are you sure this goes somewhere?

168
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,171
They say LBJ used it all the time.

169
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,942
Duane said he'd leave a car
right over there.

170
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,816
When did you...

171
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,390
...first know? I mean, about me?

172
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,725
In the car, I think.

173
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,231
On the way to the shelter,
you looked at my legs.

174
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,167
Bill stopped looking a long time ago.

175
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,332
I thought it was in the shower.

176
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,354
Oh, my God.

177
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,054
Police.

178
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,835
-What'd you do?
-I don't know.

179
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,943
-See your driver's license, sir?
-Here.

180
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,146
And registration.

181
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,112
No, I must've left it at home.

182
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,185
Step out of the car, please.

183
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,694
-Both of us?
-Both of you, please.

184
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:13,694
You may not be aware...

185
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,207
...but there is a "No left turn" sign
just down the block.

186
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,809
You went through it.

187
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,211
I don't know what was I thinking.

188
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,213
We're look-alikes.

189
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,485
Not like each other, but--

190
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,123
I know what you think.

191
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,489
People hire us to impersonate
the president and first lady.

192
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,117
We work out of an agency.

193
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,286
You sure look like him.

194
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,923
Thanks. We work very hard at it.

195
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,591
She got her hair cut to look--
Perfect match.

196
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,796
We just played the Sapperstein wedding.
They loved us.

197
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,839
We did our Club Med routine...

198
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,739
...where they go down to Club Med...

199
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:56,244
...and Bill Mitchell says,
"at 0700, I want an hour of volleyball...

200
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:00,512
"...and then at 0830, I want
a complete briefing on the surf situation."

201
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,689
And then the big finale at the Talent Club.

202
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,258
"The sun'll come out tomorrow.

203
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,020
"Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow..."

204
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,263
I'm okay.
"There'll be sun

205
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,500
"Just thinking about tomorrow

206
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,961
"Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow

207
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,471
"Till there's none

208
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,467
"Tomorrow

209
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,767
"Tomorrow, I love you

210
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,276
"Tomorrow

211
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,212
"It's only a day away

212
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,310
"Tomorrow, tomorrow

213
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,614
"We love you, tomorrow

214
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:39,121
"You're only a day away"

215
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,691
Thank you. Thanks.
We haven't worked out the final harmony.

216
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,165
This is a full-time job?

217
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,898
Yeah, lately.
Lately, it's been pretty much full-time.

218
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,405
Mr. and Mrs. Kovic,
I'm not going to give you a ticket.

219
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,667
You're not?

220
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,311
You should save all the money you have.

221
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,481
He won't give us a ticket.
He says we should save our money.

222
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,075
That's very funny.

223
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,577
You're very good.

224
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,584
But she needs a lot of work.

225
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,682
Yes, I know. She's kind of new at it.

226
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,158
Drive safely.

227
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,593
Thank you, Officer. Thank you very much.

228
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,710
I'm not sure I'm this hungry.

229
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,507
Wait. This is a very special sandwich.

230
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,620
This is good.

231
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,285
What's in it?

232
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,390
That's a secret.

233
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,126
You have a lot of secrets.

234
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,792
I guess.

235
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,471
So, what do you do the rest of the time?

236
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,306
When I'm not running the country?

237
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:14,209
I run a temp agency.
You know, secretaries and stuff.

238
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,279
You find people jobs?

239
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,588
Is that funny?

240
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,156
It's just more than most people do here.

241
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,996
Don't get carried away.
I'm not that good at it.

242
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:30,725
And your family?

243
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,768
I assume you're married.

244
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,898
I was.

245
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,497
Once.

246
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,773
It didn't take.

247
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,344
You know, Dave--

248
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,420
It is Dave, isn't it?

249
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,861
I can't keep this a secret.

250
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,261
Yeah, I know.

251
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,031
I liked doing it though.

252
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:08,038
I mean, not the fancy stuff with all...

253
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,142
...the helicopters
and the TV cameras, but...

254
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,036
...I liked saving that shelter.

255
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,442
I liked helping people
that I hadn't even met before.

256
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,951
Just then, I felt I wasn't
pretending anymore.

257
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,891
I don't think you were pretending.

258
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,737
What would you do if you were still in?

259
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,980
I mean, if you had one more chance
to be president...

260
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,581
What would you do then?

261
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,428
Lots of things.

262
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,181
Excuse me. You can't stop here.

263
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,018
No visitors.

264
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,253
Mr. President?

265
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:41,363
-I'm sorry, sir, I didn't realize--
-Just getting fresh air.

266
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,266
Certainly, sir.

267
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:46,000
I was wondering, if you don't mind,
how did you get--

268
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,539
The president wanted some ice cream.

269
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,164
You make a nice president, Dave Kovic.

270
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,064
Thanks.

271
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,006
See you.

272
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,192
We are glad you're visiting
the White House.

273
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,161
Keep moving, folks. We're walking.

274
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,663
More than a million visitors come here
every year...

275
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,701
...making it the most frequently
toured home in the country.

276
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,293
We're walking and we're stopping.

277
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,702
Whatever changes
from one administration to the next...

278
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,435
...the White House always maintains
its dignity.

279
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,737
We're walking.

280
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:02,008
He's walking.
He's Bob Alexander, the chief of staff.

281
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,274
I can't believe it!

282
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,942
What an honor for all of you.

283
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,986
Forty-two presidents have lived
in the White House.

284
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:17,956
I had no part in this. He called her.

285
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,106
What do you think you're doing?

286
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,738
You mean, the press conference?

287
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,975
I have a couple ideas
to share with the country.

288
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:39,644
Share?

289
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,649
Share?

290
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,052
You don't call a press conference.

291
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,851
I call a press conference.

292
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,483
You're nothing. Do you understand?

293
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,361
You're nobody.

294
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,124
I'm not nobody.

295
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,597
You're lint!

296
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,757
You're a flea!

297
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,093
You're a blip!

298
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:01,997
Well...

299
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,005
...maybe I am.

300
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:06,942
But you're fired!

301
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,116
I said you're fired. Get out of here.

302
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,517
I'm fired?

303
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:17,287
You're fired!

304
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,683
Fine.

305
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:21,860
Fine?

306
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,485
Fine.

307
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,461
The whole press corps is out there.

308
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:30,468
Should I go tell them?
Or did you want to?

309
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:36,307
Darling, they're waiting in the Press Room.
I think you should get in there.

310
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,302
I'm sorry. I thought we were alone.

311
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,088
I'd like your resignation on my desk
by the time I get back.

312
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,327
Don't touch anything on that desk.

313
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,839
What's up?

314
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,532
It must be the vice-president.

315
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,068
The ex-vice-president.
He'll be a prison reformer soon.

316
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,248
They're coming. Let's go.

317
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,018
Good luck.

318
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,134
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

319
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,771
I'd like to begin
with an announcement that...

320
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,368
...may come as a surprise for you.

321
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:48,873
I've...

322
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,109
...asked Bob Alexander to resign
as White House chief of staff.

323
00:25:56,054 --> 00:26:00,218
Over the last months, Bob and I
came to believe in different things.

324
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:05,654
He thinks this country's fine and we
should go about doing business as usual.

325
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,497
I just don't feel that way.

326
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,134
Not anymore.

327
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,274
Because things aren't fine.

328
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:20,536
We've got so many problems,
we don't want to look at them anymore.

329
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,172
They blend together into a big noise...

330
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,642
...and soon we can't hear ourselves think.

331
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,313
But that's not even the worst part.

332
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,145
The worst part is...

333
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,681
...we feel we can't do anything about it.

334
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,020
And that's a tragedy...

335
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,462
...because we can.

336
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,936
We don't know where to start;
maybe that's what it is.

337
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,331
But I have an idea...

338
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:51,540
...of where we can start.

339
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,942
From today...

340
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,281
...I'm making it the responsibility
of this government...

341
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,288
...to find a job for every American
who wants one.

342
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,523
Have you seen the look
in someone's face...

343
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,696
...the day they finally get a job?

344
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,862
I've had some experience with this.

345
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,629
They look like they could fly.

346
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:25,206
And it's not about the paycheck.
It's about looking in the mirror...

347
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,810
...and knowing you've done
something valuable with your day.

348
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:32,573
And if one person could start
to feel that way, then others...

349
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:36,486
Soon all these other problems
we're facing may not seem so...

350
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,481
...impossible.

351
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,094
You don't know what you can do
until you...

352
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,665
...stand up and decide to try.

353
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,046
That's it. Let's get to work. Thank you.

354
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,979
Thank you, Mr. President.

355
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:12,512
In the boldest initiative yet
of the new Mitchell administration...

356
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:16,357
...the president has proposed
a full employment program...

357
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:19,089
...unparalleled since the days of FDR.

358
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:23,127
The proposal brought swift reaction,
here on Capitol Hill.

359
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:27,702
The president's on the right track.
We should be putting people to work.

360
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,138
It's better to have people working
than collecting welfare checks.

361
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:35,543
We're carrying the water for him.
I've carried a lot of water for him.

362
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,046
And then now to say this.

363
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,980
The guy's out to lunch.

364
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,314
The lights are on but no one's home.

365
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:47,688
I love it. It's great. All we've gotta do is
cut "Star Wars" and we can pay for it.

366
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,786
I want to look at Mitchell's proposal
to see how he intends to pay for it.

367
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:55,731
It's like the program I presented
when I ran for president four years ago.

368
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:59,293
Has the president taken leave
of his faculties? I'm asking you.

369
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,701
It's the definition of modern leadership.

370
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,833
You set out a bold goal
and you don't say how you'll do it.

371
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,572
They tried this in Russia
and wrecked the country.

372
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:09,546
I wonder if the Communists got to him?

373
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,208
If you look at a photo of Mitchell...

374
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:16,981
...taken before the stroke and one after,
you will see distinct differences.

375
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,113
Are you saying this is a conspiracy?

376
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:21,751
Yes, I am saying it's a conspiracy.

377
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,792
Do you think you're a bit paranoid?

378
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,194
Have you compared the photographs?

379
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,349
This is crazy.

380
00:29:56,027 --> 00:30:00,293
The "US News" hammered us, but they're
always tough. Rosenthal loved us.

381
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:01,399
That's good.

382
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:04,024
Mr. Nance is waiting for you.

383
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,161
-Who?
-The vice-president.

384
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,603
The vice-president.

385
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:12,835
Nance. I thought--

386
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,740
I want my ears checked.

387
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,781
Sorry, I didn't understand.

388
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:20,181
Ever since the stroke I get a little--

389
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,011
Oh, my God!

390
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,370
Mr. President...

391
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,243
...these are a gift of the King of Togo.

392
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:52,373
Fertility beads.

393
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,485
And these are from the people of Burundi.

394
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,148
Thank you.

395
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,725
They know hats in Burundi. Look.

396
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,091
Mr. President,
may I speak frankly with you?

397
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,894
Yes, please. Sit down.
It's good to see you.

398
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,998
I know we don't always get along.
We've disagreed, politically.

399
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,341
And I suppose I know
what you think of me personally.

400
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,178
But I've tried to respect
the role you wanted me to play.

401
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,182
When I disagreed with this administration,
I've kept it to myself.

402
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:35,417
When you wanted my support,
you always had it.

403
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,761
Damn it, Bill.

404
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,160
How could you do
something like this to me?

405
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,592
Do what?

406
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,603
Come on, we're not children!

407
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:50,772
I didn't have anything to do with this
First Liberty nonsense and you know it!

408
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,768
First Liberty.

409
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:55,276
All I've got is my integrity, Bill.

410
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,439
That's all I have left.

411
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,614
I don't know why you've turned
your attack dogs on me.

412
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,052
They're not my attack dogs.

413
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,378
What?

414
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:07,886
I'll take care of this.

415
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,893
-We made it up.
-What do you mean?

416
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,795
We had to, Dave. The guy's a Boy Scout.

417
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,398
But this is wrong.

418
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,127
Wrong?

419
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:21,332
I know. It looks awfully bad
and I'm really embarrassed, but...

420
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:22,900
It was Bob's idea.

421
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:50,594
When I first began to look into
the allegations concerning First Liberty...

422
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:55,502
...I thought the wrongdoing
was restricted to the vice-president.

423
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,506
You better take a look at this.

424
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,737
But as I began to investigate,
I realized that...

425
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,841
...this pattern of corruption
extended much higher.

426
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:11,149
I was saddened to discover at least 15...

427
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:15,020
...separate acts of intervention
by this administration...

428
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:19,955
...most with the full knowledge
of the president, and all of them illegal.

429
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:23,030
Federal regulators were influenced...

430
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,129
...records were destroyed...

431
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,138
...and pressure was brought to bear...

432
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:31,139
...in some cases...

433
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,534
...by President Mitchell himself.

434
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,647
-Now he's making up stuff about me.
-He's not.

435
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,647
He's not?

436
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:45,716
I did all that?

437
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:48,486
You didn't. Bill Mitchell did.

438
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,993
This is a mistake.
We shouldn't be doing this.

439
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,566
I can't go into hiding.

440
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,593
Is this job stuff just a smoke screen?

441
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:35,931
I don't know how else to put it.
This dog won't hunt.

442
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:39,873
We may be able to hold off
on this First Liberty thing for a while...

443
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:42,444
...but if you're pushing this new jobs--

444
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,914
Just put us on a spit and bring the sauce.

445
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:48,383
-If you'd just wait a few months.
-Yeah, wait.

446
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,414
I don't want to wait. We can't.

447
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:54,217
Mr. President,
I understand how you feel, but...

448
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:57,055
...we're talking about obstructing
federal regulators...

449
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:59,459
...violating election laws.

450
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:02,492
I got people up on the Hill
talking about impeachment.

451
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:05,364
What is with President Mitchell lately?

452
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:09,997
I know the president's supposed to serve
four years, but now it may be 15 to 20.

453
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,802
We make fun of the president.
But it's a tough job.

454
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:21,043
Today the president woke up, broke
the law, got caught and pardoned himself.

455
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,583
That is a full day.

456
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:27,749
Mr. President...

457
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,749
...may I come in?

458
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,424
A dirty business we're in, sometimes.

459
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:41,665
Mr. President...

460
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:45,965
...whatever happens, I want you to know,
I think your jobs program is...

461
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,771
...a wonderful idea.

462
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,107
Thanks.

463
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:55,281
Not many people will
pay attention now, but...

464
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:57,679
Thanks.

465
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,362
Would you like to...

466
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,194
...sit down for a minute?

467
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,211
Do you ever...

468
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,984
...think back to how you got started?

469
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,987
I was a shoe salesman.

470
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,157
But not happy about it.

471
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:40,997
One day, my wife says to me:

472
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,231
"Why don't you run for office?

473
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,827
"You talk about it all the time.

474
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:51,406
"Why don't you just do it?"
So I tell my boss...

475
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:54,111
...I have a dentist appointment...

476
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:57,339
...and I go down
to the Registrar of Voters...

477
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,406
...on my lunch break.

478
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,585
Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.

479
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:05,251
Really?

480
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,917
My wife is my campaign manager.
We had...

481
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,717
...a budget of $2,000, with advertising.

482
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:20,532
How about you?

483
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:22,432
Me?

484
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,273
How did you get started?

485
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,109
Kind of the same way.

486
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,059
Vice-president's a good man, isn't he?

487
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,301
He's a very good man.

488
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,578
I don't want to lose you.

489
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:27,097
The president requested this rare,
joint session of Congress...

490
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:31,266
...so he can personally answer
the allegations raised by Bob Alexander...

491
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,866
...his former chief of staff.

492
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,435
It's hard to recall the last time
both houses of Congress...

493
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:40,348
...convened without any idea
of what the president plans to say.

494
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:44,945
One would speculate that it's about
the charges against Mitchell and Nance.

495
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,320
Those rumors have circulated
on Capitol Hill for several weeks.

496
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,128
It's time to go. Better get inside.

497
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,863
It's set with Duane? Everything's here?

498
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,465
Okay, let's go.

499
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,636
Relax.

500
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:06,466
Enjoy the moment.

501
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,318
-Hello, Ben.
-Big day, Bob.

502
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,420
-Thanks for coming.
-I wouldn't miss it.

503
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,288
You know the Claghorns?

504
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,848
Hey, Bob, what do you think?

505
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,758
Put that away.
Let's wait till the speech first.

506
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,490
The House will be in order!

507
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:31,033
The House will be in order!

508
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:38,700
Mr. Speaker,
the President of the United States.

509
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,042
Thank you.

510
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,713
Here it comes.

511
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:23,250
Mr. Speaker.

512
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,281
Vice-President.

513
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,149
Members of the Congress.

514
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,157
Fellow Americans.

515
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:37,096
I wish I could be here today
under different circumstances.

516
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:42,169
There are many things
about this country we should discuss.

517
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,008
But I realize that's not possible now.

518
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:50,746
As you know, my former chief of staff
has implicated me in a scandal...

519
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,943
...involving
the First Liberty Savings and Loan.

520
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:58,683
Once people start discussing a scandal,
it's hard to talk about anything else.

521
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,190
Let's talk about it.

522
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,627
Bob Alexander has accused me of--

523
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,888
I'll read this to make sure I get it right.

524
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:14,537
"...illegally influencing regulators
on behalf of campaign contributors...

525
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,165
"...interfering with an ongoing
Justice Department investigation...

526
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:22,302
"...and violating federal election laws
in the area of campaign finance."

527
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,042
Let's get to the guts of it.

528
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:28,051
Each one of these charges is true.

529
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,417
Die, you pond scum.

530
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,187
I'm the president, and as they say,
the buck stops here.

531
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:40,659
So I take full responsibility
for every one of my illegal actions.

532
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,330
But that's not the whole story.

533
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:50,567
And I think each one of you
is entitled to the whole truth.

534
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,337
I have here written proof...

535
00:41:56,881 --> 00:42:00,942
...in the form of notes,
memoranda and personal directives...

536
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:05,185
...proving that Bob Alexander
was also involved...

537
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,686
...in each of these incidents,
and in most cases, planned them as well.

538
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,229
Allegations of wrongdoing
have also been made against Nance.

539
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,700
As this evidence will prove, at no time...

540
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:26,038
...and in no way was the vice-president
involved in any of these.

541
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,203
Bob just made all that up.

542
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,706
Vice-President Nance...

543
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:36,616
...is a good and decent public servant...

544
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:40,880
...and I'd like to apologize
for any pain this caused him or his family.

545
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,638
While we're on the subject...

546
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:03,410
...I'd like to apologize
to the American people.

547
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,304
You see...

548
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:09,217
...I forgot that I was hired
to do a job for you...

549
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:12,319
...and it was just a temp job.

550
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:15,151
I forgot I had 250 million people...

551
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:18,252
...who were paying me
to make their lives a bit better.

552
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:21,254
I didn't live up to my part of the bargain.

553
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:27,337
There are certain things
you should expect from your president.

554
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,775
I had to care more about you
than I do about me.

555
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,435
I had to care more about...

556
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:40,044
...what's right than I do about
what's popular.

557
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:46,948
I ought to be willing to give up
this whole thing...

558
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:49,557
...for something I believe in...

559
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:53,187
...because if I'm not...

560
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,798
...if I'm not...

561
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:05,873
If I'm not...

562
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:09,871
If I'm not, then...

563
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,115
...maybe I don't belong here on a first...

564
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:18,211
Get a doctor!

565
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:03,517
Well?

566
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:05,717
Well?

567
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:11,233
You okay getting home?

568
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,495
Yeah, it's not far.

569
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:18,901
Take care.

570
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:27,179
I would've taken a bullet for you.

571
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:39,092
Thanks, Duane.

572
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,300
The stroke hit at 8:42 p.m...

573
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:57,500
...just as the president was concluding
his remarks to a joint session of Congress.

574
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,667
Spokesmen of the First Naval Hospital...

575
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,337
...have confirmed it was a massive edema.

576
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:06,447
Unlike his previous stroke,
it has left the president incapacitated.

577
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:09,418
The nation mourned
as President William Harrison Mitchell...

578
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:13,252
...was laid to rest at
Arlington National Cemetery.

579
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,117
After lingering in a coma
for almost five months...

580
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,093
...the president succumbed Thursday,
at 4:20 p.m.

581
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:22,792
In a bittersweet ceremony in the capital,
Vice-President Gary Nance...

582
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:27,303
...was officially sworn in today
as the 45th president of the United States.

583
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:32,301
Under the terms of the 25th Amendment,
Nance was acting with full authority...

584
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:35,139
...since Bill Mitchell's incapacitation.

585
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:40,613
I plan to continue
Bill Mitchell's call to arms.

586
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,281
This isn't my presidency,
it's his presidency.

587
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:48,154
And I can't think of a better way
to ensure his legacy...

588
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,284
...than to continue
the principles he initiated.

589
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,228
Bob Alexander and eight other members
of the Mitchell administration...

590
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:58,598
...were indicted on 34 counts
of election law violations...

591
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:00,227
...and obstruction of justice.

592
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,966
Ironically, the indictments came
just 48 hours...

593
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:07,510
...after passage of the Mitchell Jobs Bill for
a comprehensive employment program.

594
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,209
We have limited amounts of posters,
so no buttons in the envelopes.

595
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:18,817
Dave Kobic. Time for a change.

596
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:21,185
Kovic. Kovic.

597
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:25,326
We have a limited amount of posters.
Put them in busy places.

598
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,321
She's terrific. She'll do anything.

599
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:30,727
Okay, but she's changed.

600
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:35,837
It's the middle of winter.
They'll turn off her heat. She needs a job.

601
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:49,415
Would you like to volunteer?

602
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,187
You're a good man.

603
00:49:52,256 --> 00:49:55,555
Did you get the fund-raising thing
I sent you? City Council.

604
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:57,093
We have flyers here.

605
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:01,759
We're on a roll now. Karen, you got a job.

606
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,023
It's Monday.

607
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,864
And everybody works on Monday.

608
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:22,977
I understand you find people jobs?

609
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,319
You look great!

610
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:33,562
I saw you on TV at the funeral and...

611
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,600
That's finally over.

612
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,479
Why don't we go into my office?

613
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,974
Excuse us.

614
00:50:51,974 --> 00:51:01,974
