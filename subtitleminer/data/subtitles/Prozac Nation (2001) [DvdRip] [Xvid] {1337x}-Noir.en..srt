1
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,613
Back, back, back.

2
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:15,649
How fucking far back do you go?

3
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:18,853
My mom and dad were
divorced before I was 2.

4
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:23,522
And from then on, my father
was almost uninvolved in my life...

5
00:03:23,522 --> 00:03:26,980
...and my mother, much too involved.

6
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,655
She wanted to make up
for all her mistakes through me.

7
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:36,590
One night, there was something
in my pants, like, blood.

8
00:03:37,403 --> 00:03:41,040
My mom said, "Oh, hell, your period.

9
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,565
This is where all the trouble starts."

10
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,937
She was right.

11
00:04:16,204 --> 00:04:19,240
Now Mom and Dad
really had something to fight over.

12
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,571
Me.

13
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:23,812
Then one day, my dad disappeared.

14
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:27,908
No number, no letters, just gone.

15
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,552
I wrote to Seventeen magazine.

16
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:32,754
A long letter about us.

17
00:04:32,754 --> 00:04:35,822
They wanted to publish it
as an article but kept asking:

18
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:38,591
"Your dad going away?
Does he come back?

19
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:40,827
Does it have a happy ending?"

20
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:44,230
In reality, it didn't,
but I thought, "What the hell?

21
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,993
I'll give them what they want."

22
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:48,701
This is it.

23
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:50,328
Time to go.

24
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:53,072
Mom, please...

25
00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:55,174
No way are we gonna be late.

26
00:04:55,174 --> 00:04:56,642
We have hours.

27
00:04:56,642 --> 00:04:59,944
Honey, honey, you've got
registration at 4.

28
00:04:59,944 --> 00:05:01,673
Come on, now.

29
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:06,617
Oh, Lizzie, you wanna take your rug.

30
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:09,450
- Mom!
- What? Come on.

31
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:13,350
This is the most important day
of your life.

32
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:17,161
I thought that's
when you got married.

33
00:05:17,161 --> 00:05:19,925
No, honey, that's
the worst day of your life.

34
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:24,032
Yeah, she is so excited.

35
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,235
Oh, Mom, she looks beautiful.

36
00:05:26,235 --> 00:05:28,294
Pity, I was aiming for psychotic.

37
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,640
Well, yeah.

38
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,976
Grandma's so excited she's crying.

39
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:36,178
It's a journalism scholarship, Mom.

40
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:39,147
Journalism, yeah.
She wants to be a writer.

41
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:49,350
The first few days,
that's when everyone makes friends.

42
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:51,191
I know.

43
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:54,524
- It gets harder later.
- Mom, I think I'm old enough.

44
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:57,898
Don't get upset.

45
00:05:57,898 --> 00:05:59,432
I'm not getting upset.

46
00:05:59,432 --> 00:06:01,400
Why are you saying that I'm upset?

47
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:04,237
I'm just trying to help. You know that.

48
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:06,501
You know how proud
I am of you, Lizzie.

49
00:06:07,207 --> 00:06:09,675
You have so much potential.

50
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,011
Are you listening to me?

51
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:14,876
Lizzie?

52
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:17,348
Lizzie. Lizzie, what are you doing?

53
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:19,951
Come on, let's get this stuff
down to the car.

54
00:06:19,951 --> 00:06:22,920
I don't have to go to Harvard
to become a writer.

55
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:28,419
Lizzie, what are you talking about?

56
00:06:28,893 --> 00:06:31,029
At Harvard, you'll meet people.

57
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:35,033
You'll get contacts.
You'll get people to help you.

58
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:37,899
I know what I'm talking about, Lizzie.

59
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:41,392
I had my whole life ahead of me.

60
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:44,905
You don't want to go to Harvard?

61
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:47,310
Well, you just...

62
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,413
...wait until you have no choices left...

63
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:52,281
...where you've got nothing.

64
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:55,218
No one. No one
who cares about you.

65
00:06:55,218 --> 00:06:58,710
- Then you see how you feel.
- Mom, I didn't say I wasn't going.

66
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:02,288
Dr. Isaacs warned me.

67
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,592
Mom, I said, I'm going.

68
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,126
He told me you'd isolate...

69
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:08,896
...stay in your room all day.
- I'm not isolating.

70
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:11,126
Okay, I'm not gonna isolate.

71
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,091
I want things to be different.

72
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,375
Fine.

73
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,745
That's all you need, then.

74
00:07:23,745 --> 00:07:25,835
That's what I've been talking about.

75
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,448
You'll see, Lizzie.

76
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:32,349
It'll be a whole other world up there.

77
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:43,262
Young, God, I was so young.

78
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:47,799
You be careful. When I think of it,
just a year older than you...

79
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:50,095
...and I was already a housewife.

80
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:53,999
God, I was so bored
I bought a monkey...

81
00:07:55,238 --> 00:07:57,798
...just to have someone to talk to.

82
00:07:58,408 --> 00:08:00,000
But then you came along.

83
00:08:27,168 --> 00:08:29,671
Oh, my God.

84
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:32,774
Lizzie, Lizzie, it's so...

85
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:34,742
Harvard.

86
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:43,710
But you're on the fifth floor.

87
00:08:44,016 --> 00:08:45,785
I know.

88
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:48,521
Well, how are we
gonna manage, huh?

89
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:51,257
I can do it, okay, Mom?
Don't worry about it.

90
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:53,555
- No, no, no.
- Hi.

91
00:08:55,227 --> 00:08:56,660
May I be of assistance?

92
00:08:57,797 --> 00:09:00,789
Could you? Oh, that's too kind.

93
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:03,160
My pleasure.

94
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:07,471
Ever since she
was in second grade...

95
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:09,573
...she was always writing.

96
00:09:09,573 --> 00:09:12,943
The man has "good catch"
written all over his forehead.

97
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:16,003
Any minute now she'
gonna ask me to confirm it.

98
00:09:16,613 --> 00:09:18,582
Lizzie.

99
00:09:18,582 --> 00:09:21,185
I've always helped my
mother pick up boyfriends.

100
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,455
The only one I never got a say in
was the one that mattered.

101
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:25,818
My dad.

102
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:29,624
Now, that's quality. That's a father.

103
00:09:29,624 --> 00:09:32,994
Could you imagine your father?
We'd still be in Manhattan.

104
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:35,519
I told him you've already
had things published.

105
00:09:37,432 --> 00:09:41,926
Don't you think you should be getting
the car back? It's getting kind of late.

106
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:44,604
Yeah.

107
00:09:46,942 --> 00:09:48,637
Don't forget to eat.

108
00:09:58,017 --> 00:09:59,541
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, Mom.

109
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:09,822
Ever since I was a little kid, my mom
and I always hung out together.

110
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:16,023
I didn't fit in with most kids in school.

111
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:20,701
They thought I was strange,
so they made me feel like a stranger.

112
00:10:22,807 --> 00:10:26,344
And my mother took advantage of it
from an early age.

113
00:10:26,344 --> 00:10:29,714
Throwing me into plays,
spelling bees, studying...

114
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:34,481
...writing, museums, concerts
and even more writing.

115
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:37,414
She convinced me this would
lead to the Holy Grail.

116
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:41,323
Harvard. A place where I would
finally be surrounded by people...

117
00:10:41,323 --> 00:10:43,359
...I had something in common with.

118
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:45,594
I'm not gonna ask for much.

119
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:48,323
They don't have
to be a Springsteen fan.

120
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,333
Nice meeting you guys.

121
00:10:58,007 --> 00:10:59,408
- Hi.
- Hi.

122
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,277
You're Elizabeth, right?

123
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:04,267
Yeah, I thought that I recognized you
from the face book.

124
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:08,449
I read that article that you wrote
about your parents' divorce.

125
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:11,185
- That was brilliant.
- Thank you.

126
00:11:11,185 --> 00:11:13,086
- I'm Ruby.
- Hi.

127
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:15,850
- We're gonna be roommates.
- Oh, cool.

128
00:11:17,558 --> 00:11:21,195
Seriously, you don't have any idea
what that article meant to me.

129
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:25,222
You telling the grisly truth about
your parents, exposing all their lies.

130
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:29,933
And then meeting with your father,
reconciling with him.

131
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:32,994
So inspiring.

132
00:11:36,908 --> 00:11:38,397
Do you smoke?

133
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:43,782
You know, I've never smoked
in the daytime before.

134
00:11:43,782 --> 00:11:47,309
Well, we're at Harvard now.
We can do whatever we want to.

135
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:49,517
Cool.

136
00:11:52,222 --> 00:11:54,622
We'll be like these
beautiful, literary freaks.

137
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:58,452
And brilliant and dark, sexy.

138
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:04,596
Trouble is, I'm deadly serious.

139
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:16,510
Boys never used to notice me before.

140
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,105
I wasn't even on their list
of alternatives.

141
00:12:44,904 --> 00:12:47,064
Ruby gets it. She gets me.

142
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,541
If she were a guy,
everything would be perfect.

143
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:07,591
When Lou Reed was 17 years old,
he was diagnosed...

144
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:09,684
...as suffering from mood swings.

145
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:15,729
He was subjected to electric-shock
treatment three times a week.

146
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,404
Each treatment hit him
as a blinding white light...

147
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:23,273
...and therein lies his genius.

148
00:13:23,273 --> 00:13:25,309
To embrace
his own psychic carnage...

149
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:29,038
...and create some of the greatest
rock 'n' roll the world has ever heard.

150
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,507
I feel his cold embrace...

151
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,376
...his sly caress.

152
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,778
Lying in my room for days on end.

153
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:09,449
Everything cold, dark, silvery.

154
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:13,252
I'm scared he'll take me back to
the depths of my own twisted desire...

155
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,954
...to a place I'm too afraid to go to
because maybe I'll never escape.

156
00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:19,218
I'll bet you got thousands at home.

157
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:26,157
Cigarette packs,
with tiny, little writing on them.

158
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,901
Your life story?

159
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:32,994
Diary? No?

160
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,961
Come on, this is killing me.

161
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:40,278
It's an assignment.

162
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:43,438
You're the most conscientious
student at Harvard.

163
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,877
It's a music review.

164
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:50,645
I'm trying to start a music
column for The Crimson.

165
00:14:51,086 --> 00:14:52,678
That's great.

166
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:57,887
You wanna do some X?

167
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,058
You've never done X.

168
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:06,289
Acid goes to your head, right?

169
00:15:08,235 --> 00:15:10,396
X goes to your heart.

170
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:15,292
Hey.

171
00:16:15,898 --> 00:16:17,160
You okay?

172
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:24,229
What are you doing in here?

173
00:16:27,475 --> 00:16:29,610
Oh, no.

174
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,601
Do you wanna go back inside?

175
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:40,421
There's a guy out there.

176
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:42,580
I think he's looking for you.

177
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:19,723
His voice comes to me
under the covers.

178
00:17:19,723 --> 00:17:24,128
"Come here, baby." He' inside
of me, where no one else has been...

179
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:26,720
...in my dark and secret place.

180
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,065
I let him take me there...

181
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:31,098
...but then my fear returns.

182
00:17:31,098 --> 00:17:33,234
I want him to stop.

183
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:36,838
How do you think it feels?
And when do you think it stops?

184
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:38,907
I don't want him in control.

185
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:40,408
I want him to be gone.

186
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:42,343
I want him not to exist.

187
00:17:42,343 --> 00:17:44,212
I mean, let' face it.

188
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:46,237
"Lou Reed should be dead."

189
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,118
It's great.

190
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:02,758
You gonna sleep with me tonight?

191
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:07,332
Don't say I didn't warn you.

192
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:11,995
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means don't say I didn't warn you.

193
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:16,364
Great.

194
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:23,581
I've been wanting so badly
for sex to happen the right way...

195
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:27,607
...with the right person,
at the right time, in the right place.

196
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:33,123
- It wasn't any big deal.
- When is it, though?

197
00:18:33,123 --> 00:18:36,024
- It should've been.
- Well, at least he's good-looking.

198
00:18:36,393 --> 00:18:38,195
It was my first time.

199
00:18:38,195 --> 00:18:40,231
Yeah, sure.

200
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:41,858
No, I'm serious.

201
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:45,991
Are you kidding me?

202
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:47,935
It's true.

203
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,733
No way, I don't believe you.

204
00:18:50,305 --> 00:18:53,536
I figured I should start having sex
like a normal 19-year-old.

205
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,479
I happen to think
this calls for celebration.

206
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:01,278
- We could have a party.
- A party?

207
00:19:06,088 --> 00:19:08,287
It was meant to be subtle...

208
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:10,156
...but of course...

209
00:19:10,156 --> 00:19:14,320
Elizabeth, this is great.
Such a wild idea.

210
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,424
Everyone got it.

211
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:22,929
Only not everyone was so pleased.

212
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:26,840
I wish I'd have thought
of something like this.

213
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,705
Thanks.

214
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:31,143
I love your dress.

215
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,881
Hey.

216
00:19:44,422 --> 00:19:48,059
How can you take something private
and turn it into something public?

217
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,357
It wasn't private to begin with.

218
00:19:51,996 --> 00:19:55,667
- It was good. It was interesting.
- Interesting?

219
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:57,500
I just mean it wasn't about me.

220
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,833
You know, it wasn't special.
It was just sex.

221
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:05,370
Okay, that's cool.

222
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:08,604
You don't look cool with it.

223
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:20,054
I'd been saving my virginity
for someone who truly loves me...

224
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:22,723
...who really knows the inside of me.

225
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:25,092
Noah wasn't it.

226
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:28,195
He told me afterwards that,
in terms of absolute value...

227
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:31,365
...sex and drugs were
equally meaningless to him.

228
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:34,027
Just two different ways to have fun.

229
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:37,571
Which is all well and good...

230
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:40,506
...until a girl tries to have
the same approach.

231
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,978
Lizzie?

232
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:46,376
- Hey, have you guys seen Lizzie?
- No.

233
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,870
Lizzie?

234
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,677
Lizzie?

235
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,187
Lizzie, you got a phone call.

236
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,055
- Who is it?
- Rolling Stone.

237
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,955
Rolling Stone?

238
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,365
The college journalism
award for 1985...

239
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:09,598
...goes to Elizabeth Wurtzel...

240
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:12,796
...for her Harvard Crimson piece
on Lou Reed.

241
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:19,809
I want to forget everything
that has happened to me before.

242
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:22,039
I wanna freeze this moment.

243
00:21:24,114 --> 00:21:25,672
Forever.

244
00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:35,947
Thank you.

245
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,760
- It's great.
- No, you're great.

246
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,295
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

247
00:21:41,295 --> 00:21:44,932
I'm thinking about the bands coming
to Cambridge who you can cover.

248
00:21:44,932 --> 00:21:48,002
It's rare we get somebody
who's going to all the gigs...

249
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:49,804
...writing with such clarity.

250
00:21:49,804 --> 00:21:52,140
So I'm thinking
he's coming on to me...

251
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,309
...and he's, like, an editor
at Rolling Stone.

252
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:57,176
And how old is he?

253
00:21:57,176 --> 00:21:59,779
- Oh, my God.
- What?

254
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:01,246
- It's my dad.
- Oh, cool.

255
00:22:02,982 --> 00:22:04,817
Look at that.

256
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:08,721
- What?
- I can't believe he left us for that.

257
00:22:08,721 --> 00:22:10,756
What? What's the matter?

258
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:12,958
I haven't seen him in four years.

259
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,493
Wait. I thought you said...

260
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:16,791
I know what I said.

261
00:22:25,202 --> 00:22:28,365
Dad, when are you coming back
to live with us?

262
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,302
Well, I'm not, honey. You know that.

263
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,338
But Mom said that if you want to,
she wants you to.

264
00:22:39,383 --> 00:22:41,985
I'm sure your mom
didn't say that, did she?

265
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,748
She did.

266
00:22:44,688 --> 00:22:46,455
Honey, you know...

267
00:22:46,455 --> 00:22:48,082
...it's just not gonna happen.

268
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,488
Which doesn't mean
that I love you any the less.

269
00:23:08,477 --> 00:23:10,442
Who does he think he is?

270
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:15,248
He disappears for four fucking years.
Then he thinks he can come here...

271
00:23:15,248 --> 00:23:18,351
...and take pictures of his perfect
Ivy League daughter?

272
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:20,453
This place has nothing to do with him.

273
00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:23,623
The least he can do is have
the decency to understand that.

274
00:23:23,623 --> 00:23:25,725
You should say something to him.

275
00:23:25,725 --> 00:23:27,090
Like what?

276
00:23:27,527 --> 00:23:29,085
I don't know.

277
00:23:29,395 --> 00:23:32,332
How's your new life?
How's your new fucking girlfriend?

278
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:34,632
Lizzie, he's your father.
He loves you.

279
00:23:34,632 --> 00:23:36,634
No, you don't know what it was like.

280
00:23:36,634 --> 00:23:39,203
When I was 8, we went
to see The Last Waltz.

281
00:23:39,203 --> 00:23:41,105
He passed out on tranquilizers.

282
00:23:41,105 --> 00:23:44,876
I had to sit through the movie three
fucking times before he woke up.

283
00:23:44,876 --> 00:23:46,969
What kind of a person does that?

284
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:50,412
I didn't realize.

285
00:23:51,882 --> 00:23:53,317
That article...

286
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:55,547
...it was just wish fulfillment.

287
00:23:55,987 --> 00:23:58,754
I was writing about how
I wanted things to be.

288
00:23:58,754 --> 00:24:00,656
The way people talked about it...

289
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:03,420
...the way you talked about it,
it made it seem real.

290
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,388
Well, maybe it can be.

291
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:13,635
No. It's just a dream I held
on to for way too long.

292
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:16,197
I'm happy here.
I don't need him anymore.

293
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,735
We should go. Are you coming?

294
00:24:21,177 --> 00:24:24,872
No. I promised my editor
that article by next week.

295
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:57,707
Jesus, it's 4:00 in the morning.
Do you mind?

296
00:24:58,243 --> 00:25:00,377
I know. I'm sorry.

297
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:03,176
Music helps me concentrate.

298
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,621
Springsteen' like
this garage-mechanic poet.

299
00:25:11,621 --> 00:25:14,954
You can feel the sweat in his voice,
the grime in his guitar.

300
00:25:15,691 --> 00:25:19,229
When he sings, I see steamy streets...

301
00:25:19,229 --> 00:25:21,264
...lovers groping hands...

302
00:25:21,264 --> 00:25:22,999
...busted fenders.

303
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:27,163
The dirt is under his nails
and the clairvoyance in his eyes.

304
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,570
Jesus, Lizzie,
you haven't slept in days.

305
00:25:40,548 --> 00:25:43,384
I had it perfect before.

306
00:25:43,384 --> 00:25:45,681
I know I can get it back.

307
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:51,125
His words twist and grind and
hammer out a story for the brain...

308
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:54,061
...but his guitar and voice go
straight for your heart.

309
00:25:54,061 --> 00:25:58,327
Music bellows from his insides, and
out comes the struggles of the world.

310
00:26:00,032 --> 00:26:02,668
Springsteen'
like this garage-mechanic poet.

311
00:26:02,668 --> 00:26:05,193
Music bellows from his insides.

312
00:26:11,277 --> 00:26:15,414
Out comes the struggles of the world,
of knowledge that comes with perfec...

313
00:26:15,414 --> 00:26:18,851
It' like he feels with knowledge
that goes back through ages...

314
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:23,356
...to a single chord in our brains.
That beacon that can be touched...

315
00:26:23,356 --> 00:26:25,289
He has the power of pure emotion.

316
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:28,486
Emotions so intense the body
literally must do something...

317
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:48,043
- Out comes the struggles...
- Fuck.

318
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:50,102
She still hasn't slept.

319
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:55,344
Lizzie.

320
00:26:55,884 --> 00:26:57,613
Lizzie!

321
00:26:58,186 --> 00:27:00,822
I don't know how to say this
to you, all right...

322
00:27:00,822 --> 00:27:03,154
...but you are starting to smell.

323
00:27:03,825 --> 00:27:05,452
This is important.

324
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:10,065
Lizzie, it's not as important as
your health. You gotta get some sleep.

325
00:27:10,065 --> 00:27:11,293
Will you just fuck off?

326
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:14,791
I just have to finish this.

327
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:18,095
I can get you some downers, okay?

328
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,996
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

329
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:27,580
Noah? Noah, come on,
give it to me. Noah!

330
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,415
Lizzie, this is just scribbling.

331
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:31,651
What? What the fuck? Asshole!

332
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:34,587
Stop it. Noah, put her down.
Put her...

333
00:27:34,587 --> 00:27:36,954
Jesus, she turned
into the Harvard bag lady.

334
00:27:36,954 --> 00:27:39,357
- What are you doing?
- She needs something.

335
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,592
- What?
- I don't know, some medical help.

336
00:27:41,592 --> 00:27:43,082
Ruby!

337
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:49,358
It's okay. I got them, I got them.
It's all right.

338
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,437
Emotions so intense...

339
00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:54,734
Bodies fly into air...

340
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:00,705
Lizzie. Lizzie, look.

341
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,845
You gotta calm down, okay?

342
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:06,940
That's not what you said when
I had your dick in my mouth.

343
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:17,559
You had any drugs
in the last 24 hours?

344
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,254
No.

345
00:28:19,762 --> 00:28:24,133
Well, I guess I snorted some coke
and smoked some pot...

346
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:26,792
...but that was just to make
the Ecstasy last longer.

347
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:29,099
Sure you're not forgetting anything?

348
00:28:29,936 --> 00:28:31,301
Maybe a few beers.

349
00:28:32,105 --> 00:28:36,143
Did you ever think you might have
a substance-abuse problem?

350
00:28:36,143 --> 00:28:40,013
The only substance problem I have
is I need you to give me some tranqs...

351
00:28:40,013 --> 00:28:43,005
...so I can come down
off this fucking coke.

352
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:44,645
And then what happens?

353
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,155
So you don't like coming here,
and you don't want to talk.

354
00:28:51,155 --> 00:28:54,025
You don't have to.
You don't have to say anything...

355
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:57,128
...you don't want to say,
but if you don't say anything...

356
00:28:57,128 --> 00:28:58,862
...if you don't talk to me...

357
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,125
...I can't help you.

358
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,069
You know, if you're
gonna suggest therapy, don't.

359
00:29:05,069 --> 00:29:06,764
I'm living proof it doesn't work.

360
00:29:07,305 --> 00:29:10,468
- So, what are you doing here?
- My friends brought me here.

361
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:14,639
Had nothing to do with you?

362
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,381
Are you gonna give
me something, doctor?

363
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,782
No.

364
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:21,477
Not today.

365
00:29:32,462 --> 00:29:34,293
I'm falling.

366
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:37,300
I can't even finish my article.

367
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,167
Maybe Noah' right.
It' all a scribble.

368
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:42,465
I don't really have
anything original to say.

369
00:29:44,071 --> 00:29:46,140
Writing can't save me.

370
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,199
Even Harvard can't save me.

371
00:29:49,243 --> 00:29:51,711
How can I escape from
the demons in my head?

372
00:29:52,913 --> 00:29:55,082
- I didn't.
- So, what, did she blow you?

373
00:29:55,082 --> 00:29:58,219
- Did you go...? What?
- Yeah, she fucking blew me, all right?

374
00:29:58,219 --> 00:30:00,386
- But I was drunk.
- You fucking shithead.

375
00:30:00,386 --> 00:30:03,843
How fucking could you?
How fucking...?

376
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,458
Lizzie?

377
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:08,392
Lizzie, stop.

378
00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:10,851
Lizzie!

379
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:13,565
Lizzie, I'm gonna fucking kill you.

380
00:30:13,565 --> 00:30:15,901
I'm gonna fucking kill you, you bitch.

381
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:18,303
Sam told me. He told me everything.

382
00:30:18,303 --> 00:30:21,273
You losing your virginity,
was that another fucking lie?

383
00:30:21,273 --> 00:30:23,275
You don't understand. Okay?

384
00:30:23,275 --> 00:30:25,711
You don't understand.
It was an accident.

385
00:30:25,711 --> 00:30:28,678
An accident?
You call that a fucking accident?

386
00:30:28,678 --> 00:30:32,349
It was...
It was sort of, you know...

387
00:30:32,349 --> 00:30:34,943
- Come on, what?
- An accidental blowjob.

388
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,919
Oh, fuck you.

389
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:40,490
I could fucking kill you, Lizzie.

390
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:44,290
I swear to God, I could fucking kill you.
How could you do that?

391
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,371
Hemingway has this classic moment
in The Sun Also Rises.

392
00:30:56,371 --> 00:31:00,074
When someone asks Mike Campbell
how he went bankrupt...

393
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:04,478
...all he can say is,
"Gradually, then suddenly."

394
00:31:04,478 --> 00:31:06,614
That' how depression hits.

395
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,913
You wake up one morning
afraid that you're going to live.

396
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:15,521
I can't believe we're back to this.

397
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:17,823
You think I wanna be like this?

398
00:31:17,823 --> 00:31:20,223
I don't know. I don't know, Lizzie.

399
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,156
I thought everything
was gonna be okay.

400
00:31:25,431 --> 00:31:28,594
I was so proud of you at Harvard.

401
00:31:30,436 --> 00:31:33,496
- Is it because I haven't visited you?
- No, Mom.

402
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,677
I thought this was behind us.
Then I get a phone call...

403
00:31:37,677 --> 00:31:39,768
Mom, this has nothing to do with you.

404
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:48,908
I mean, it's nothing you've done.

405
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:56,783
Why did they move you here?

406
00:31:57,127 --> 00:31:58,958
I asked for a single room.

407
00:32:00,097 --> 00:32:01,865
Why?

408
00:32:01,865 --> 00:32:03,660
Reasons of mental instability.

409
00:32:04,566 --> 00:32:07,536
I told them I just...
I can't live with other people.

410
00:32:07,536 --> 00:32:09,163
You told...

411
00:32:10,906 --> 00:32:12,498
You said that?

412
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:16,845
Oh, Lizzie. Your education.

413
00:32:16,845 --> 00:32:18,472
This opportunity.

414
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,207
I'm sorry, Mom.

415
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:29,556
You know, I just can't cope with this.

416
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:31,524
It's just all too much.

417
00:32:31,524 --> 00:32:34,459
It's all so crazy.

418
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:39,690
I am not going to do this anymore!

419
00:32:45,238 --> 00:32:47,672
No, you listen to me.

420
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:53,344
I raise her! I raise her all by myself
with no help from you!

421
00:32:53,344 --> 00:32:57,615
No help from me? I'm the one that
does everything, I never get credit!

422
00:32:57,615 --> 00:33:01,319
You make all the decisions,
and they blow up in your face!

423
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:03,621
- Do they not?
- What are you talking about?

424
00:33:03,621 --> 00:33:06,758
You do nothing for her!
You do nothing for her!

425
00:33:06,758 --> 00:33:09,127
You never even see her!

426
00:33:09,127 --> 00:33:13,164
You don't take her on vacations.
You don't take her on the weekends.

427
00:33:13,164 --> 00:33:15,765
What the hell do you ever
do for her, Donald?

428
00:33:15,765 --> 00:33:19,901
I am her father. I put her in the clinic,
and you're looking in Manhattan.

429
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:23,739
You son of a bitch!
Goddamn, I hate you! I hate you!

430
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:26,765
I hate you, you son of a bitch!

431
00:33:31,447 --> 00:33:32,880
What is wrong with you?

432
00:33:33,315 --> 00:33:34,543
Nothing.

433
00:33:35,885 --> 00:33:38,752
Oh, God. You're not...?

434
00:33:39,055 --> 00:33:42,822
Pregnant? No, Mom, I'm not pregnant.

435
00:33:42,822 --> 00:33:45,492
Anyway, it's the '80s.
That wouldn't be a problem.

436
00:33:45,492 --> 00:33:47,789
Please, Lizzie, don't speak like that.

437
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:49,855
What, then?

438
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:01,397
I don't understand you, Lizzie.

439
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,941
This place is filthy.
I'll help you clean it up.

440
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,716
Mom, no.

441
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:19,149
I don't have a simple solution, okay?

442
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:25,027
I don't know what to do, Lizzie.

443
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:29,466
- I've taken a couple days off work.
- No, you can't.

444
00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:31,331
I wanna help.

445
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:38,107
- God knows I can't afford it, but...
- I'm much better by myself. Okay?

446
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:40,736
If I'd known you'd react like this...

447
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:46,649
Look, I have to study.

448
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:50,053
You know, I've been working
really hard...

449
00:34:50,053 --> 00:34:54,454
...and I've been having a difficult time.
I just needed a few days.

450
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:58,426
I'm so worried about you, Lizzie.

451
00:34:58,426 --> 00:35:01,529
I promise I'll take care of myself.

452
00:35:01,529 --> 00:35:03,019
Okay?

453
00:35:03,431 --> 00:35:05,626
And I'll come and see you.

454
00:35:06,067 --> 00:35:07,935
I've seen enough already.

455
00:35:07,935 --> 00:35:10,460
We'll spend time together
in New York.

456
00:35:10,805 --> 00:35:12,830
Please? I promise.

457
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:16,734
I just have all this work
I have to finish here.

458
00:35:17,877 --> 00:35:20,037
Maybe for your birthday.

459
00:35:21,247 --> 00:35:23,549
Yeah. Yeah.

460
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:26,143
I promise I will be home
for my birthday.

461
00:35:26,452 --> 00:35:28,147
We can celebrate.

462
00:35:28,788 --> 00:35:31,557
- We'll have a party.
- Okay.

463
00:35:31,557 --> 00:35:34,321
I'll make those pear tarts that you like.

464
00:35:35,294 --> 00:35:37,125
That would be great.

465
00:35:42,665 --> 00:35:44,190
Hey.

466
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,810
Lizzie, I love you dearly.
Really, I do.

467
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:56,780
But you can only hang out in my room
if you don't drink or do drugs.

468
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,873
Come on, you can't be serious.

469
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:01,051
Totally.

470
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:02,382
Just say no.

471
00:36:04,054 --> 00:36:07,249
But, Noah, there's no reason
to be in your room sober.

472
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:16,631
I wanna explain to Noah
how exhausted I am.

473
00:36:16,631 --> 00:36:18,667
Even in my dreams.

474
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:20,969
How I wake up tired.

475
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:24,632
How I'm being drowned
by some kind of black wave.

476
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:26,372
But I can't write.

477
00:36:26,942 --> 00:36:30,273
And he really doesn't wanna
know about it anyway.

478
00:36:42,755 --> 00:36:45,019
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

479
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,690
Hi.

480
00:36:48,061 --> 00:36:49,426
Hi.

481
00:36:57,268 --> 00:37:00,805
Ruby, this is crazy.
We have to talk.

482
00:37:00,805 --> 00:37:03,239
You know, I'd really rather not.

483
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:07,141
I'm sorry. You know that.

484
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:10,348
And I have no excuse.

485
00:37:10,348 --> 00:37:12,680
So then, why? Why did you do it?

486
00:37:14,351 --> 00:37:16,946
I'm just really fucked up.

487
00:37:17,822 --> 00:37:19,722
I'm like a defective model...

488
00:37:19,722 --> 00:37:24,283
...and you don't know that until
you've been around me a while.

489
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:30,966
You know, some days I wake up,
and I just feel so flat-out, just fucked...

490
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:33,402
...that I'll do anything to feel different.

491
00:37:33,402 --> 00:37:35,604
Lizzie, when we're together,
you're fine.

492
00:37:35,604 --> 00:37:38,440
- You're fun. You're...
- I'm faking it.

493
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,431
- Well, everybody does that.
- Not like me.

494
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,404
Look, we all have bad days.

495
00:37:46,947 --> 00:37:51,281
This is what people say in situations
when they don't know what to say.

496
00:37:51,585 --> 00:37:53,109
Fuck.

497
00:37:53,453 --> 00:37:55,819
I don't know what to suggest either.

498
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:00,987
People care about you, Lizzie.

499
00:38:01,661 --> 00:38:03,964
What I want is for someone
to understand...

500
00:38:03,964 --> 00:38:05,465
...but they don't, really.

501
00:38:05,465 --> 00:38:07,666
That makes the platitudes
harder to bear.

502
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:09,366
They do, people wanna help.

503
00:38:09,366 --> 00:38:12,604
All right? I wanna help you,
but I don't know what to do.

504
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:14,902
I don't need the company line
right now, okay?

505
00:38:17,509 --> 00:38:18,976
Okay.

506
00:38:19,778 --> 00:38:22,914
Jesus. Listen to me.

507
00:38:22,914 --> 00:38:26,111
All I see is the dark side of everything.

508
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:29,154
Poor Ruby.

509
00:38:29,154 --> 00:38:31,321
I kill her joy.

510
00:38:31,321 --> 00:38:34,524
Look at her sad, discouraged face.

511
00:38:34,524 --> 00:38:35,889
I don't know what to say.

512
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,824
How about,
"Shit, call in the professionals"?

513
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:56,243
So I guess this is the Freud part,
where I don't say anything...

514
00:38:56,243 --> 00:38:59,474
...and you don't say anything.
All of a sudden, it's:

515
00:38:59,747 --> 00:39:02,978
"Obviously, you wish to sleep
with your father."

516
00:39:03,951 --> 00:39:07,088
So I'm to take it you don't wish to
sleep with your father?

517
00:39:07,088 --> 00:39:08,487
No.

518
00:39:10,758 --> 00:39:13,818
And I don't wanna talk
about my childhood either.

519
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:18,230
I don't know why I'm here.

520
00:39:19,798 --> 00:39:21,732
Why might you be here?

521
00:39:24,803 --> 00:39:26,634
I can't write.

522
00:39:28,307 --> 00:39:30,240
And what do you write about?

523
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,947
I write stories, poems, articles.

524
00:39:34,947 --> 00:39:37,643
I'm here on a journalism scholarship.

525
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:43,786
I've been writing forever. I have to.

526
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:47,450
How long has it been
since you stopped writing?

527
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:50,787
About a month.

528
00:39:51,895 --> 00:39:54,598
Do you remember
the first thing you wrote?

529
00:39:54,598 --> 00:39:56,266
A poem.

530
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:58,427
A poem. About what?

531
00:39:58,735 --> 00:40:00,259
My dad.

532
00:40:00,904 --> 00:40:02,806
Can you remember anything it said?

533
00:40:02,806 --> 00:40:05,366
I told you, I don't wanna
talk about my childhood.

534
00:40:09,044 --> 00:40:12,347
I just... I feel so stupid,
sitting in therapy.

535
00:40:12,347 --> 00:40:14,783
People have much harder
childhoods than mine.

536
00:40:14,783 --> 00:40:17,649
We're not talking about others.
We're talking about you.

537
00:40:18,153 --> 00:40:20,321
I'll give her that much.

538
00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:22,312
I'm the problem.

539
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:27,361
I worry about being in therapy.

540
00:40:27,361 --> 00:40:30,331
I worry about not being in therapy.

541
00:40:30,331 --> 00:40:33,662
I even worry I'm not entertaining
enough for Dr. Sterling.

542
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,536
I just keep thinking that
if I could just be normal...

543
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:41,674
...if I could just get out of bed in the
morning, everything would be okay.

544
00:40:41,674 --> 00:40:43,574
Well, what do you think normal is?

545
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:50,081
Most people, they cut themselves,
they put a Band-Aid on, keep going.

546
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:51,644
And what do you do?

547
00:40:52,418 --> 00:40:53,749
I just keep bleeding.

548
00:40:54,387 --> 00:40:58,155
So you think being normal is having
a wound, putting a patch on it...

549
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,679
...then go on with your life?

550
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,249
Isn't that what functioning is?

551
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,296
Isn't that what living is?

552
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,365
You know, you keep going,
no matter what happens to you.

553
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,230
Is that the way you wanna live?

554
00:41:37,459 --> 00:41:39,120
Mom.

555
00:41:41,163 --> 00:41:43,427
Oh, come on, now, honey.

556
00:41:43,732 --> 00:41:47,791
Why don't you tie up your hair
anymore? Your face is so pretty.

557
00:41:51,304 --> 00:41:53,238
Here they are.

558
00:41:59,779 --> 00:42:01,508
Come on, now, Lizzie.

559
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:10,783
Hi, honey!

560
00:42:14,425 --> 00:42:16,585
Is she home yet?

561
00:42:25,537 --> 00:42:29,803
I need someone to shut off my brain
and turn on my heart.

562
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:35,544
Well, I have long brown hair,
dark eyes.

563
00:42:35,544 --> 00:42:38,414
You probably meet tons of
girls in the men's bathroom.

564
00:42:38,414 --> 00:42:41,941
Oh, yeah, the Ecstasy goddess.

565
00:42:42,552 --> 00:42:45,621
Yes, I can't believe
you remember that.

566
00:42:45,621 --> 00:42:47,088
Lizzie.

567
00:42:50,293 --> 00:42:52,284
Can you hang on a sec?

568
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,398
Grandma and Grandpa are here.

569
00:42:55,398 --> 00:42:56,763
Yes, I heard.

570
00:42:58,232 --> 00:43:03,761
You know, the only reason I threw a
birthday party was to make you happy.

571
00:43:05,472 --> 00:43:08,609
I don't understand how you can
treat me like this.

572
00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:10,304
Can I have some privacy, please?

573
00:43:20,521 --> 00:43:22,282
That was my mother.

574
00:43:22,688 --> 00:43:26,225
It's my birthday.
She's throwing this big party for me.

575
00:43:26,225 --> 00:43:27,926
Cool.

576
00:43:27,926 --> 00:43:30,622
Well, no, actually, it's not.

577
00:43:30,963 --> 00:43:33,899
It's just me and my mother
and my grandparents.

578
00:43:33,899 --> 00:43:35,588
I haven't even been out there yet.

579
00:43:35,588 --> 00:43:37,453
Aren't they missing you?

580
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:40,092
Well, now you sound like
a nice Jewish boy.

581
00:43:40,092 --> 00:43:43,083
Well, I might, if I was Jewish.

582
00:43:44,195 --> 00:43:46,595
I just wanted to call and say hi.

583
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:50,368
Let's meet up when
you get back to school.

584
00:43:50,368 --> 00:43:52,570
Okay, that'd be great.

585
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:55,903
Hey, happy birthday.

586
00:43:58,043 --> 00:43:59,601
Thank you.

587
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,047
Rafe didn't seem to realize...

588
00:44:04,047 --> 00:44:07,074
...he'd just been appointed
to save my life.

589
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,355
Rolling Stone magazine.

590
00:44:12,355 --> 00:44:15,491
It's the music magazine.

591
00:44:15,491 --> 00:44:18,895
That's wonderful, honey.

592
00:44:18,895 --> 00:44:23,799
They want her to work for them. Yeah.
Paid work for Rolling Stone.

593
00:44:24,367 --> 00:44:25,800
They'll pay her?

594
00:44:32,641 --> 00:44:36,009
I think she was up writing
late last night.

595
00:44:36,979 --> 00:44:39,003
Were you up writing late last night?

596
00:44:39,814 --> 00:44:41,680
I haven't written anything in months.

597
00:44:42,984 --> 00:44:45,454
She's always working on something.

598
00:44:45,454 --> 00:44:47,656
She just doesn't like to talk about it.

599
00:44:47,656 --> 00:44:49,454
Like you've ever read any of it.

600
00:44:55,463 --> 00:44:57,598
Lizzie, this isn't very nice.

601
00:44:57,598 --> 00:44:59,226
You want one?

602
00:45:09,141 --> 00:45:12,077
What's wrong with her?

603
00:45:12,745 --> 00:45:15,648
Nothing. Ma, nothing's wrong with her.

604
00:45:15,648 --> 00:45:18,351
- She's drunk.
- Of course I'm drunk.

605
00:45:18,351 --> 00:45:21,821
- She's just tired.
- She's as skinny as a ghost.

606
00:45:21,821 --> 00:45:24,119
She's overtired.
They work so hard up there.

607
00:45:25,691 --> 00:45:27,819
- Lizzie.
- Is she on drugs?

608
00:45:28,695 --> 00:45:31,230
- I wish I was on drugs.
- Lizzie.

609
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,199
- Did she say that she...?
- No, Ma.

610
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:35,733
It's okay. Everything is okay.

611
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,971
Mom, believe me,
if I was on drugs, I'd tell you.

612
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:42,074
People don't behave this way
if they're not on drugs.

613
00:45:42,074 --> 00:45:44,474
I fucking do.

614
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:58,153
I'm so sorry, Mama.

615
00:46:07,897 --> 00:46:11,400
I dream about all the things
I wish I'd said.

616
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,538
The opposite of what
came out of my mouth.

617
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:18,140
I wish I'd said,
"Mom, please forgive me.

618
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,276
Please help me.

619
00:46:20,276 --> 00:46:23,575
I know I have no right
to behave this way."

620
00:46:36,992 --> 00:46:39,060
- Hello.
- Hey.

621
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,264
- Hi.
- How' my birthday girl?

622
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:44,665
You're late. You're a day late.

623
00:46:44,665 --> 00:46:46,964
What can I say, you know how it is.

624
00:46:47,235 --> 00:46:51,306
Anyway, I thought I'd have to be
dealing with your secretary by now.

625
00:46:51,306 --> 00:46:54,741
You're such a bigshot journalist,
writing for Rolling Stone.

626
00:46:54,741 --> 00:46:56,710
- Did you read it?
- You know...

627
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:59,109
...remember this,
they're lucky to have you.

628
00:47:00,046 --> 00:47:02,950
These guys, they're smart.
They're really smart.

629
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:05,619
They know what they're doing.
They can see talent.

630
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:08,722
I'm probably gonna get assignments
all over the country...

631
00:47:08,722 --> 00:47:10,824
...so I could maybe come visit you.

632
00:47:10,824 --> 00:47:12,814
Who are you talking to, Lizzie?

633
00:47:14,493 --> 00:47:16,996
- It's no one.
- Who is it?

634
00:47:16,996 --> 00:47:18,898
- It's no one.
- Don't listen to her.

635
00:47:18,898 --> 00:47:20,365
Please, Mom.

636
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:24,103
Look at you, the two of you.

637
00:47:24,103 --> 00:47:26,505
- Go on, you're so in love with him.
- Mom.

638
00:47:26,505 --> 00:47:28,840
Can you hear that?
Hear why I don't call?

639
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,575
Where was he your childhood?

640
00:47:30,575 --> 00:47:32,669
- Where...?
- Stop it! Just stop it!

641
00:47:35,214 --> 00:47:37,883
I just wanted to talk to him!

642
00:47:37,883 --> 00:47:40,477
You know, Lizzie,
I'm at the end of my rope.

643
00:47:43,321 --> 00:47:47,257
I've been working extra hours.
I never go out.

644
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:51,685
I never buy clothes.
I spend all our money on your therapy.

645
00:47:52,963 --> 00:47:55,362
All our money? Daddy pays, Mom.

646
00:47:55,698 --> 00:47:57,665
You think he pays?

647
00:47:58,868 --> 00:48:01,132
You think he's paying?

648
00:48:01,537 --> 00:48:04,707
He doesn't pay one cent.

649
00:48:04,707 --> 00:48:08,733
Not one single red cent!

650
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,613
That's not true.

651
00:48:11,947 --> 00:48:15,417
Oh, you want me to show you?
Huh? You wanna see?

652
00:48:15,417 --> 00:48:20,156
You want to see how much I'm paying,
still paying...

653
00:48:20,156 --> 00:48:22,924
...on your last term bill? Huh?

654
00:48:22,924 --> 00:48:25,893
Here. Here, look at these.
Look at these.

655
00:48:25,893 --> 00:48:28,997
- There, look at that, Lizzie.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

656
00:48:28,997 --> 00:48:33,525
You wanna see how much
I'm paying this Dr. Sterling?

657
00:48:33,835 --> 00:48:35,237
I'm sorry.

658
00:48:35,237 --> 00:48:37,739
No, you're not gonna
talk your way out of this.

659
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:40,606
Ask her who pays her!

660
00:48:43,345 --> 00:48:47,447
You know, it's my fault,
for spoiling you the way I did.

661
00:48:47,447 --> 00:48:51,985
I kill myself to get you to Harvard, and
you come back looking like a zombie.

662
00:48:51,985 --> 00:48:54,818
I know. I'm sorry.

663
00:48:55,788 --> 00:48:57,313
I'm so...

664
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:00,150
Why won't he?

665
00:49:01,961 --> 00:49:04,929
- Why won't he?
- I know. I know, honey. I know.

666
00:49:06,565 --> 00:49:10,636
I hate myself,
and I hate the things I do.

667
00:49:10,636 --> 00:49:13,606
Lizzie, it's all right. It's all right.

668
00:49:17,209 --> 00:49:19,540
It's awful. It's so awful.

669
00:49:21,979 --> 00:49:25,184
And I hurt the people who love me.

670
00:49:25,184 --> 00:49:28,050
But when he calls...

671
00:49:34,692 --> 00:49:36,716
My God, a party?

672
00:49:37,128 --> 00:49:40,290
And your stupid pear tart!

673
00:49:47,704 --> 00:49:49,272
Why do you do this, Lizzie?

674
00:49:49,272 --> 00:49:53,071
Because I'm not
your goddamn monkey!

675
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,740
I'm sorry, Mom, I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry.

676
00:50:02,385 --> 00:50:04,410
I didn't mean it.

677
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,786
I'm sorry.

678
00:50:16,498 --> 00:50:18,932
She threw the party for herself?

679
00:50:20,201 --> 00:50:21,836
No, I guess for Grandma.

680
00:50:21,836 --> 00:50:24,168
Why would she want to do that?

681
00:50:27,175 --> 00:50:29,938
To show her what
a good little girl she was.

682
00:50:30,812 --> 00:50:32,779
That must really hurt.

683
00:50:33,848 --> 00:50:38,284
Look at her.
This isn't a breakthrough, darling.

684
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:42,152
My mom pays $ 100 an hour for this.

685
00:50:43,489 --> 00:50:48,895
This is the same bullshit. Insight time.
It's like that stuff with that guy Rafe.

686
00:50:48,895 --> 00:50:52,165
I don't have to be Freud to know
I have a fear of rejection.

687
00:50:52,165 --> 00:50:55,101
And I know where it comes from.
I know it's from my dad.

688
00:50:55,601 --> 00:50:58,137
But it doesn't change anything.

689
00:50:58,137 --> 00:51:01,163
- I still can't go out with him.
- Why not?

690
00:51:01,673 --> 00:51:03,198
I just told you.

691
00:51:05,877 --> 00:51:08,346
You didn't tell me
anything about Rafe.

692
00:51:08,848 --> 00:51:11,645
Has he ever given you reason
to believe he'd reject you?

693
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,589
Do not show him how crazy you are.

694
00:51:25,095 --> 00:51:27,431
- A monkey?
- Called Percy.

695
00:51:27,431 --> 00:51:29,133
I know, it beats me.

696
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:31,901
- She needed someone to talk to.
- Well, she had you.

697
00:51:31,901 --> 00:51:33,493
No, no, this was before.

698
00:51:33,837 --> 00:51:36,328
- Are you listening?
- God, yes.

699
00:51:36,673 --> 00:51:37,970
I'm not boring you?

700
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:41,009
Please, Lizzie.
I met you in a men's room.

701
00:51:41,009 --> 00:51:44,377
- You're anything but boring.
- What am I?

702
00:51:46,316 --> 00:51:48,147
Scary.

703
00:51:49,686 --> 00:51:52,177
So are we gonna go to this gig?

704
00:51:53,922 --> 00:51:55,480
I'm not sure.

705
00:51:56,492 --> 00:51:58,427
I don't really know where it is.

706
00:51:58,427 --> 00:52:01,591
You came to see a gig,
and you don't know where it is?

707
00:52:02,198 --> 00:52:05,496
I said I came to see the gig...

708
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:10,199
You know.

709
00:52:11,106 --> 00:52:15,043
- What?
- Okay, now you're just being cruel.

710
00:52:15,043 --> 00:52:16,677
No, no, you said...

711
00:52:16,677 --> 00:52:20,546
I said I came to see the gig...

712
00:52:21,715 --> 00:52:24,412
...but I came to see you.

713
00:52:44,971 --> 00:52:48,202
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

714
00:52:49,742 --> 00:52:52,710
Waiting for him to make the move.

715
00:52:55,848 --> 00:53:00,809
Doesn't he know?
He' gotta be my salvation.

716
00:53:09,527 --> 00:53:11,763
It' lovely that he' caring...

717
00:53:11,763 --> 00:53:14,961
...compassionate
and politically correct.

718
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,801
But I need him to kiss me.

719
00:53:17,801 --> 00:53:19,702
Right now.

720
00:54:06,047 --> 00:54:08,038
Ruby!

721
00:54:08,818 --> 00:54:10,648
Ruby.

722
00:54:16,123 --> 00:54:17,386
Hey.

723
00:54:17,658 --> 00:54:19,421
Hey.

724
00:54:19,692 --> 00:54:23,493
I didn't know you'd moved rooms.
I thought you were still in here.

725
00:54:25,633 --> 00:54:29,124
Ruby was telling me about
those articles you're planning to write.

726
00:54:30,737 --> 00:54:33,467
That stuff's always
been easy for me.

727
00:54:37,878 --> 00:54:40,546
Dr. Sterling must have called him.

728
00:54:40,546 --> 00:54:42,945
Why else would he be here?

729
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:46,652
Probably to see how dire
the situation is.

730
00:54:46,652 --> 00:54:49,416
See if his little girl can
get through the day still.

731
00:54:50,189 --> 00:54:51,918
Or...

732
00:54:52,392 --> 00:54:55,484
...maybe he really did finally miss me.

733
00:54:56,495 --> 00:54:57,756
My girl.

734
00:55:00,832 --> 00:55:03,001
Dad, you know those medical bills?

735
00:55:03,001 --> 00:55:05,526
The ones for the psychiatric
treatment?

736
00:55:07,506 --> 00:55:09,674
They keep sending them to Mom.

737
00:55:09,674 --> 00:55:12,404
So I guess you haven't paid.

738
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:16,312
- I can't believe you're asking me this.
- Oh, you have paid?

739
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:18,416
You're all cold and distant.

740
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:20,351
And... And...

741
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:23,086
And now you're asking me what?

742
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,620
What are you talking about?

743
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:28,425
- If you don't know...
- No. No, I don't know.

744
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:32,262
- You made a promise.
- You haven't written me.

745
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:34,397
You never call me.

746
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:36,699
It's like I don't even exist.

747
00:55:36,699 --> 00:55:41,370
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- I even come and visit you.

748
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:43,305
- Fuck you!
- You watch that language!

749
00:55:43,305 --> 00:55:45,874
- Is that a way to talk to your father?
- Listen.

750
00:55:45,874 --> 00:55:49,679
You're the one who left. You're the one
who walked away for four years.

751
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,914
You think I don't know that?
Is that what you think?

752
00:55:52,914 --> 00:55:54,649
You think I don't feel it?

753
00:55:54,649 --> 00:55:59,488
Do you that think it's easy for me,
away from you?

754
00:55:59,488 --> 00:56:01,189
I hate it.

755
00:56:01,189 --> 00:56:03,291
The effect it had on you.

756
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:05,093
Your mother and myself.

757
00:56:05,093 --> 00:56:07,929
I hated watching you get trapped
right in the middle.

758
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:10,198
- In between the two of us.
- Dad, please.

759
00:56:10,198 --> 00:56:12,132
Please!

760
00:56:12,132 --> 00:56:13,700
- You're my father.
- Right.

761
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,770
And you won't even pay
my medical bills.

762
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:20,035
Even though it won't cost you
anything.

763
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:23,797
All you have to do is sign the papers.

764
00:56:26,011 --> 00:56:28,247
It's 10 percent.

765
00:56:28,247 --> 00:56:31,485
- It's, like, nothing.
- No.

766
00:56:31,485 --> 00:56:34,353
I lost my apartment, everything,
when we got divorced.

767
00:56:34,353 --> 00:56:39,091
- It won't cost you anything.
- Sorry, Lizzie.

768
00:56:39,091 --> 00:56:41,787
That's your mother's responsibility.

769
00:56:44,296 --> 00:56:47,766
What do you want me to do?
You want me to slit my wrists...

770
00:56:47,766 --> 00:56:50,502
...so that I'll qualify as a trauma case
for...?

771
00:56:50,502 --> 00:56:52,732
This is killing me too.

772
00:56:53,138 --> 00:56:55,307
This is killing me.

773
00:56:55,307 --> 00:56:56,908
I mean, I feel so powerless.

774
00:56:56,908 --> 00:56:59,377
I look back at all the mistakes
that I made.

775
00:56:59,377 --> 00:57:02,277
I made a lot of mistakes,
and there's nothing I can do.

776
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:04,909
What am I gonna do?

777
00:57:11,655 --> 00:57:13,520
Hey, you.

778
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:17,184
Hi.

779
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:29,070
Guess who?

780
00:57:29,471 --> 00:57:31,598
What are you doing?

781
00:57:31,973 --> 00:57:35,443
Nothing. Just walking.

782
00:57:35,443 --> 00:57:37,680
Walking with somebody.

783
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,171
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I could be walking with a girl.

784
00:57:41,884 --> 00:57:44,750
Okay, fine, you're right. It's a boy.

785
00:57:46,021 --> 00:57:47,921
He's tall.

786
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,281
Very tall.

787
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:52,861
Of course he's taller than me.

788
00:57:52,861 --> 00:57:55,091
How tall are you?

789
00:57:55,831 --> 00:57:57,598
Tall enough.

790
00:57:57,598 --> 00:58:00,123
I'd say 6 feet.

791
00:58:01,402 --> 00:58:04,666
Long lashes, brown eyes.

792
00:58:04,938 --> 00:58:09,739
He's kind of got that sexy,
intellectual, preppy thing going on.

793
00:58:12,545 --> 00:58:14,080
What?

794
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,748
Oh, cool. Yeah, I will.

795
00:58:15,748 --> 00:58:17,951
I'll ask him as soon as I hang up.

796
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:19,586
All right. Okay.

797
00:58:19,586 --> 00:58:22,255
Bye. Bye.

798
00:58:22,255 --> 00:58:26,925
Well, who now thinks of me
as a sexy intellectual?

799
00:58:26,925 --> 00:58:28,790
My mom.

800
00:58:29,929 --> 00:58:32,331
She wants us to visit
over the holidays.

801
00:58:32,331 --> 00:58:34,527
She just moved.
I'm going anyway.

802
00:59:53,073 --> 00:59:57,177
Every time I'm with him, I see myself
doing these horrible things.

803
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:59,880
And I hate myself for it,
but I just can't stop.

804
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,682
Okay, let's say that you could.

805
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:04,081
What would you do differently?

806
01:00:06,953 --> 01:00:10,756
So when I saw you with her, I just...

807
01:00:10,756 --> 01:00:12,191
I don't know.

808
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:15,251
I know it's crazy, but...

809
01:00:16,162 --> 01:00:19,221
I can't help it.
I just have these feelings.

810
01:00:22,268 --> 01:00:26,067
I'm sorry. I didn't...
I didn't realize.

811
01:00:28,474 --> 01:00:30,343
Hey, it's gonna happen.

812
01:00:30,343 --> 01:00:33,242
Beautiful women just
throw themselves at me.

813
01:00:43,689 --> 01:00:46,156
- It's Earl Grey!
- Shit, sorry.

814
01:00:46,156 --> 01:00:48,158
- I'll get you another.
- Forget it.

815
01:00:48,158 --> 01:00:50,060
- It's no problem.
- I don't want it.

816
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:52,095
Could we get another Earl Grey here?

817
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,898
- I said, I don't want it.
- Would you relax, Lizzie?!

818
01:00:54,898 --> 01:00:57,600
- It's just a goddamn cup of tea.
- Don't yell at me.

819
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,501
Just don't be ridiculous, okay?

820
01:01:00,937 --> 01:01:03,039
You fucked her, didn't you?

821
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:06,508
- What? Are you crazy?
- Don't yell at me!

822
01:01:06,508 --> 01:01:08,704
I really don't know
what the problem is.

823
01:01:09,512 --> 01:01:12,639
Why don't you just keep fucking her
if that's what you want.

824
01:01:18,186 --> 01:01:20,212
- Just go away.
- Lizzie.

825
01:01:22,658 --> 01:01:24,694
Hey. Lizzie, Lizzie.

826
01:01:24,694 --> 01:01:27,062
Lizzie. Come on.

827
01:01:27,062 --> 01:01:29,497
I'm sorry, okay?

828
01:01:29,497 --> 01:01:31,767
I'm so... I'm sorry.
I didn't understand...

829
01:01:31,767 --> 01:01:36,438
...how upset you are.
It's not your fault, all right?

830
01:01:36,438 --> 01:01:38,030
It's my... It's my fault.

831
01:01:39,641 --> 01:01:41,972
You're gonna leave me, aren't you?

832
01:01:42,676 --> 01:01:44,871
No, I could never...

833
01:01:47,981 --> 01:01:49,472
I love you.

834
01:01:51,251 --> 01:01:53,276
Why?

835
01:01:58,557 --> 01:02:00,856
There's nothing you feel...

836
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:05,991
...that you don't feel right down
to the bottom of yourself.

837
01:02:06,266 --> 01:02:08,359
You're incredible.

838
01:02:22,548 --> 01:02:27,109
I understand now how people
sometimes want to kill their lovers.

839
01:02:28,986 --> 01:02:31,147
Eat their lovers.

840
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:35,190
Inhale the ashes of their dead lovers.

841
01:02:36,694 --> 01:02:40,289
It' the only way to posses
another person.

842
01:03:03,652 --> 01:03:06,382
My mom's gonna love you.

843
01:03:09,824 --> 01:03:13,055
- You want juice?
- Sure.

844
01:03:16,932 --> 01:03:18,865
Lizzie, listen.

845
01:03:19,934 --> 01:03:23,471
I'm not gonna be able to make it
back with you for the holidays.

846
01:03:23,471 --> 01:03:26,141
There's something that came up
with my mom...

847
01:03:26,141 --> 01:03:28,336
...and I need to...
I need to go home.

848
01:03:29,378 --> 01:03:31,580
But it's the holidays.

849
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:34,682
- I need you to be with me.
- And I wish I could be.

850
01:03:34,682 --> 01:03:37,082
I just... I can't be in two places
at once.

851
01:03:39,986 --> 01:03:42,956
Okay. I'll come with you.

852
01:03:42,956 --> 01:03:44,591
I'll help you with your mom.

853
01:03:44,591 --> 01:03:47,293
It's the right thing to do.
My mom will understand.

854
01:03:47,293 --> 01:03:49,318
Your mom just moved apartments,
Lizzie.

855
01:03:50,363 --> 01:03:52,899
But I wanna be with you.

856
01:03:52,899 --> 01:03:55,834
But right now your mom needs you.

857
01:04:00,406 --> 01:04:04,210
It's just... It's a really
complicated situation.

858
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:06,845
Lizzie, my mom...

859
01:04:06,845 --> 01:04:10,475
...she isn't real easy with strangers.
Okay?

860
01:04:11,551 --> 01:04:16,020
I am right in the middle of some shit
that is not making me happy, Lizzie.

861
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,022
I know, I know.

862
01:04:18,022 --> 01:04:20,821
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

863
01:04:21,993 --> 01:04:25,063
I just... I love you, and I wanna help.

864
01:04:25,063 --> 01:04:28,699
You are. Lizzie, you are helping me.

865
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:30,301
Just...

866
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:33,293
Just knowing that I'm gonna see you.

867
01:04:34,038 --> 01:04:37,408
We'll have all next term together,
okay?

868
01:04:37,408 --> 01:04:40,935
- Okay?
- Okay.

869
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:43,946
So he asked me to help him.

870
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:45,782
You know, to be strong for him.

871
01:04:45,782 --> 01:04:48,718
And I said, "Okay."

872
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,887
But I really did.
I did the whole thing.

873
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:54,623
I kissed him goodbye.
I made it so easy for him.

874
01:04:54,623 --> 01:04:58,292
And it actually made it
easier for me.

875
01:04:58,292 --> 01:05:01,421
- And we're both really happy.
- Well, that's great.

876
01:05:37,597 --> 01:05:39,359
Wow.

877
01:05:42,235 --> 01:05:44,237
Did you get everything
moved in okay?

878
01:05:44,237 --> 01:05:47,501
Sure. I mean, it's not too much.

879
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:53,036
You know, it's a south-facing
apartment. I get light all day long.

880
01:05:54,913 --> 01:05:58,940
And it's so much easier to clean.

881
01:06:00,886 --> 01:06:03,320
I think you'll like your room.

882
01:06:08,626 --> 01:06:10,059
Oh, yeah.

883
01:06:10,595 --> 01:06:14,565
So I'll just, you know,
put my things away.

884
01:06:14,565 --> 01:06:18,399
- Haven't made you any dinner, honey.
- Well, that's okay.

885
01:06:23,941 --> 01:06:26,209
I'll pay her back one day.

886
01:06:26,209 --> 01:06:28,370
I swear I will.

887
01:06:45,028 --> 01:06:48,190
- You said that your friend was...
- He had a family emergency.

888
01:06:50,365 --> 01:06:54,003
- But he was going to come.
- Yes.

889
01:06:54,003 --> 01:06:57,340
He just... He had to go back
to Texas because...

890
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:58,940
I don't know.

891
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:00,932
His name's Rafe.

892
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:05,480
That's a nice name.

893
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,182
You'd really like him.

894
01:07:07,182 --> 01:07:09,884
He's good-looking and kind.

895
01:07:09,884 --> 01:07:12,045
And he's Jewish.

896
01:07:12,387 --> 01:07:16,255
And, you know, he works
really, really hard.

897
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:21,696
- Well, maybe next time.
- Yeah.

898
01:07:21,696 --> 01:07:23,264
He wanted to meet you.

899
01:07:23,264 --> 01:07:25,933
He has a very close relationship
with his mother.

900
01:07:25,933 --> 01:07:27,696
That's nice.

901
01:07:36,241 --> 01:07:38,471
I gotta make a call.

902
01:07:38,978 --> 01:07:41,814
Lizzie, don't.
It's, like, the 10th time today.

903
01:07:41,814 --> 01:07:43,750
So?

904
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:48,520
So you'll drive him crazy,
piss him off.

905
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,722
You don't know
what you're talking about.

906
01:07:50,722 --> 01:07:52,952
Fuck you for saying that.

907
01:07:53,658 --> 01:07:55,193
Hello, Mrs. Stevenson?

908
01:07:55,193 --> 01:07:57,162
Hi, this is Lizzie.

909
01:07:57,162 --> 01:07:59,964
Lizzie. I'm a friend of Rafe's.

910
01:07:59,964 --> 01:08:03,335
Is he there? Oh, he's busy.

911
01:08:03,335 --> 01:08:05,826
Well, could you tell him it's urgent?

912
01:08:07,172 --> 01:08:10,073
Okay. Bye.

913
01:08:11,642 --> 01:08:13,303
Why won't he pick up the phone?

914
01:08:15,813 --> 01:08:18,509
I would never do this to him.

915
01:08:21,752 --> 01:08:23,776
So how is he?

916
01:08:24,621 --> 01:08:27,283
I don't know. He was out.

917
01:08:33,496 --> 01:08:36,332
I wonder if he lays awake at night
missing me...

918
01:08:36,332 --> 01:08:38,697
...the way I miss him.

919
01:08:44,406 --> 01:08:46,966
You ever love anybody, Ruby?

920
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:49,941
I mean, really love somebody.

921
01:08:50,846 --> 01:08:52,905
You kidding? Sure.

922
01:08:54,283 --> 01:08:57,479
You think you have.
You have no idea.

923
01:08:59,487 --> 01:09:00,977
I suppose that you do.

924
01:09:04,892 --> 01:09:08,796
Real love is total.

925
01:09:08,796 --> 01:09:11,199
It's like life or death.

926
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:13,401
You know you'll die
when you're apart...

927
01:09:13,401 --> 01:09:16,493
...because the need is so pure.

928
01:09:17,037 --> 01:09:19,164
So complete.

929
01:09:21,775 --> 01:09:23,173
All you know is sex.

930
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:29,215
Christ, you gave me a hard time
about Sam.

931
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:32,343
You never loved Sam.
How could you?

932
01:09:37,555 --> 01:09:39,325
Oh, was I mean?

933
01:09:39,325 --> 01:09:42,556
You can't take it,
the happening chick that you are?

934
01:09:46,232 --> 01:09:49,429
Lizzie, I'm not crying
because you're mean.

935
01:09:50,902 --> 01:09:54,269
I just can't imagine how incredibly
painful it must be to be you.

936
01:10:09,419 --> 01:10:13,014
Listen, I'm at the airport.

937
01:10:15,791 --> 01:10:18,861
No. No, I mean, I'm here...

938
01:10:18,861 --> 01:10:20,851
...at the Austin Airport.

939
01:10:23,432 --> 01:10:24,934
Oh, my God.

940
01:10:24,934 --> 01:10:27,596
I've become the ultimate
nightmare girlfriend.

941
01:10:30,139 --> 01:10:31,970
Maybe you should call your mom.

942
01:10:32,441 --> 01:10:35,068
Let her know you're okay.

943
01:10:35,477 --> 01:10:37,069
I can't.

944
01:10:39,948 --> 01:10:41,678
Lizzie.

945
01:10:42,918 --> 01:10:45,387
Look, you remember I told you...

946
01:10:45,387 --> 01:10:48,253
...you coming here wasn't
such a good idea?

947
01:10:49,858 --> 01:10:51,325
If you loved me enough.

948
01:10:52,894 --> 01:10:54,763
All right, look.

949
01:10:54,763 --> 01:10:59,132
There's something that
I haven't told you about.

950
01:11:00,502 --> 01:11:03,904
- Oh, Christ, don't look at me like that.
- Just tell me.

951
01:11:03,904 --> 01:11:06,607
- It's not what you think.
- Bastard.

952
01:11:06,607 --> 01:11:09,742
- Cheap bastard.
- It's my sister.

953
01:11:09,742 --> 01:11:11,835
It's my sister, all right!

954
01:11:20,419 --> 01:11:23,479
So you're from New York originally?

955
01:11:23,889 --> 01:11:26,414
Manhattan. I grew up
on the Upper West Side.

956
01:11:36,034 --> 01:11:38,002
Rafe showed me
copies of your articles.

957
01:11:38,504 --> 01:11:40,869
That's quite an achievement
for a first year.

958
01:11:43,175 --> 01:11:45,076
Ellen. Ellen.

959
01:11:45,076 --> 01:11:47,812
Hey, stop. Come on, please.

960
01:11:47,812 --> 01:11:51,407
Hey, let's eat, okay. Come on.

961
01:11:54,553 --> 01:11:56,987
You promised me you'd go to bed,
okay?

962
01:11:56,987 --> 01:11:58,455
Good, come on. That's it.

963
01:11:58,455 --> 01:12:00,857
Come on. Hey, come on.

964
01:12:00,857 --> 01:12:03,260
Come on. Stop.

965
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:06,696
Ellen, you go to bed, and we'll go
to the park tomorrow, okay?

966
01:12:06,696 --> 01:12:09,232
Come on. Come on, please?
Just, please.

967
01:12:09,232 --> 01:12:11,825
Hey, you wanna go
to the park tomorrow?

968
01:12:22,411 --> 01:12:25,080
Might have to take her to the doctor.

969
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:28,481
This carries on much longer,
I don't know what we're gonna do.

970
01:12:29,952 --> 01:12:31,647
What is it?

971
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:37,390
You get off on this.

972
01:12:41,462 --> 01:12:43,191
What?

973
01:12:44,065 --> 01:12:46,590
This does it for you.

974
01:12:53,373 --> 01:12:56,935
- What are you talking about?
- You hid her from me.

975
01:12:57,645 --> 01:12:59,746
Don't you think there's a reason?

976
01:12:59,746 --> 01:13:01,914
Don't you think
that tells me something?

977
01:13:01,914 --> 01:13:03,417
Oh, Christ.

978
01:13:03,417 --> 01:13:05,584
You're some kind of creepy voyeur.

979
01:13:05,584 --> 01:13:09,455
- You like other people's misery.
- You're sick.

980
01:13:09,455 --> 01:13:12,091
You're really... You're really sick.

981
01:13:12,091 --> 01:13:14,149
Tell me it's not true.

982
01:13:15,127 --> 01:13:17,027
Rafe, please.

983
01:13:18,297 --> 01:13:20,356
I'll get the car.

984
01:13:34,879 --> 01:13:37,415
Mom? How have you been?

985
01:13:37,415 --> 01:13:39,918
How do you think I've been?

986
01:13:39,918 --> 01:13:42,487
Christ, Lizzie, don't you ever think?

987
01:13:42,487 --> 01:13:45,690
I'm sorry. I just...
I had to get to the airport right away.

988
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:49,493
I would have told you.
We've been having some problems.

989
01:13:49,493 --> 01:13:52,830
It' just been really hard,
but we're patching things up.

990
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:54,998
Yeah, he loves me. I know he does.

991
01:13:54,998 --> 01:13:56,795
It just...

992
01:13:57,467 --> 01:13:59,803
He's just got
all this weird family stuff.

993
01:13:59,803 --> 01:14:01,671
He' trying to help them and me.

994
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:06,209
And he' gotta help himself first.

995
01:14:06,209 --> 01:14:09,178
And when he does,
everything' gonna be okay.

996
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:12,949
- I'm sure.
- I mean, I know we'll be fine.

997
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:16,406
I know that. I mean, do you think?

998
01:14:18,286 --> 01:14:22,848
I'm no real help to you there, Lizzie.

999
01:14:23,391 --> 01:14:25,188
I know. I know.

1000
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:28,219
Mama, I'm sorry you had to move.

1001
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:32,594
I know, sweetheart.

1002
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:37,939
- I'm gonna go now, okay?
- Mom?

1003
01:14:37,939 --> 01:14:40,133
You call me...

1004
01:14:45,112 --> 01:14:46,807
Mom?

1005
01:14:47,748 --> 01:14:49,545
...when you've...

1006
01:14:52,452 --> 01:14:55,421
...seen Dr. Sterling.

1007
01:14:55,421 --> 01:14:57,082
Mom?

1008
01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:59,050
- Bye, honey.
- Mom!

1009
01:15:12,038 --> 01:15:14,527
I should've listened to him.

1010
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:18,541
He told me not to come here.

1011
01:15:19,578 --> 01:15:22,376
I'm more trouble than I'm worth.

1012
01:15:27,218 --> 01:15:29,618
Well, what about your reading?

1013
01:15:30,021 --> 01:15:32,256
No, no.

1014
01:15:32,256 --> 01:15:34,987
Honey, you gotta get some work done.

1015
01:15:38,329 --> 01:15:41,933
Lizzie, this isn't working.

1016
01:15:41,933 --> 01:15:43,733
I know, I know, I know.

1017
01:15:43,733 --> 01:15:46,504
As soon as I get back,
I'll write your exam schedule.

1018
01:15:46,504 --> 01:15:49,870
There's no need, okay?
There's no need...

1019
01:15:57,279 --> 01:15:59,281
Well, then, I'll call you.

1020
01:15:59,281 --> 01:16:03,012
No, no calls! No calls, okay?

1021
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,948
Look, this is not working, all right?

1022
01:16:07,224 --> 01:16:08,656
This is not my life.

1023
01:16:08,656 --> 01:16:11,455
I don't want this anymore.

1024
01:16:13,295 --> 01:16:15,930
What do you want?
Oh, you just woke up...

1025
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:18,634
...and decided you wanted
to fuck freshmen girls...

1026
01:16:18,634 --> 01:16:21,102
...and do lots of drugs?

1027
01:16:22,171 --> 01:16:23,933
Is that what you want?

1028
01:16:26,774 --> 01:16:28,643
Yeah.

1029
01:16:28,643 --> 01:16:31,611
Yeah, that's exactly what I want.

1030
01:16:33,448 --> 01:16:36,905
I want to party.
I wanna have some fun.

1031
01:16:54,532 --> 01:16:57,036
You're the one who told me
to trust somebody.

1032
01:16:57,036 --> 01:16:59,305
Look what happened!

1033
01:16:59,305 --> 01:17:01,374
- You trusting Rafe has nothing...
- No!

1034
01:17:01,374 --> 01:17:04,143
All I want is for Rafe to come back...

1035
01:17:04,143 --> 01:17:06,244
...and you're talking about pills?

1036
01:17:06,244 --> 01:17:08,880
Because things are more difficult
for you now...

1037
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:12,418
...I think you could use help.
- You said I was making progress.

1038
01:17:12,418 --> 01:17:14,686
Sometimes things
are more painful before...

1039
01:17:14,686 --> 01:17:16,988
You said this
would amount to something.

1040
01:17:16,988 --> 01:17:18,989
All this fucking pain!

1041
01:17:18,989 --> 01:17:22,482
And I am still saying that.

1042
01:17:25,329 --> 01:17:28,128
I can't believe you're pushing drugs
after all of this.

1043
01:17:29,501 --> 01:17:32,404
I'm recommending that you try
this medication...

1044
01:17:32,404 --> 01:17:36,737
...so you can gain some perspective
and not spin out of control.

1045
01:17:39,643 --> 01:17:41,610
Lizzie, isn't that what you want?

1046
01:17:50,119 --> 01:17:54,145
It takes two to six weeks
before your system swerves.

1047
01:17:56,291 --> 01:17:58,350
I know you don't.

1048
01:17:58,961 --> 01:18:01,930
But I can see it working okay.

1049
01:18:05,867 --> 01:18:09,303
Your mother' been calling.
She wants to come and see you.

1050
01:18:15,843 --> 01:18:18,112
Engine' beginning throttling
down now...

1051
01:18:18,112 --> 01:18:19,409
...at 94 percent.

1052
01:18:19,847 --> 01:18:23,180
Normal throttle for most of the flight,
104 percent.

1053
01:18:23,485 --> 01:18:26,621
Three engines are running normally.
Three good fuel cells.

1054
01:18:26,621 --> 01:18:28,712
Three good APUs.

1055
01:18:29,022 --> 01:18:31,157
Velocity, 2257 feet per second.

1056
01:18:31,157 --> 01:18:33,227
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

1057
01:18:33,227 --> 01:18:35,596
- Nothing.
- Trying to steal my purse.

1058
01:18:35,596 --> 01:18:38,689
- Challenger, go at throttle up.
- Roger, go at throttle up.

1059
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:43,736
The space shuttle Challenger
exploded in a ball of fire...

1060
01:18:43,736 --> 01:18:45,771
...after it left the launching pad.

1061
01:18:45,771 --> 01:18:47,706
- the fragments from the...

1062
01:18:47,706 --> 01:18:50,275
Officials are saying there is
no evidence...

1063
01:18:50,275 --> 01:18:52,645
...to indicate that the astronauts
survived.

1064
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:54,280
President Reagan...

1065
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:57,883
- Challenger honored us with
the manner in which they lived.

1066
01:18:57,883 --> 01:19:00,886
Material from the scattered craft
is reported to be...

1067
01:19:00,886 --> 01:19:04,844
The worst accident in the history
of American space program...

1068
01:19:06,892 --> 01:19:09,690
- was a sign that something
had gone terribly wrong.

1069
01:19:12,696 --> 01:19:14,432
Ruby?

1070
01:19:14,432 --> 01:19:16,300
- Ruby?
- Jesus.

1071
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:17,927
Hold on. Hold on, all right?

1072
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:22,005
Ruby, come on, this is serious.

1073
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,575
- What?
- My mother's been mugged.

1074
01:19:24,575 --> 01:19:27,975
I have to go to New York.
You've gotta come with me.

1075
01:19:29,179 --> 01:19:30,875
No.

1076
01:19:31,381 --> 01:19:33,150
Ruby, come on.

1077
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:35,640
I'm asking for your help.

1078
01:19:36,286 --> 01:19:38,620
Lizzie, I'm done helping.

1079
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:41,357
You're done? How can you...?

1080
01:19:41,357 --> 01:19:43,120
I can't.

1081
01:19:43,793 --> 01:19:45,623
I've had it.

1082
01:19:45,928 --> 01:19:47,863
All right?
I can't do it anymore.

1083
01:19:47,863 --> 01:19:49,298
This has gotta end.

1084
01:19:49,298 --> 01:19:52,324
Next week is just gonna be
some other crisis.

1085
01:19:56,738 --> 01:19:58,899
One for the road.

1086
01:20:14,488 --> 01:20:16,457
She refused the intravenous Demerol.

1087
01:20:17,725 --> 01:20:20,928
She refuses painkilling drugs?

1088
01:20:20,928 --> 01:20:23,726
Can we possibly be related?

1089
01:20:24,498 --> 01:20:28,399
Looks like she's gonna be here
for a few days, but she'll be just fine.

1090
01:20:29,335 --> 01:20:31,839
She'll need some help
when she gets back home.

1091
01:20:31,839 --> 01:20:33,465
But everything will be okay.

1092
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:39,975
It' scary.

1093
01:20:40,379 --> 01:20:44,315
For the first time,
I'm being deprived of my tears.

1094
01:20:49,654 --> 01:20:51,986
I don't know what I'm doing.

1095
01:20:55,193 --> 01:20:57,229
I mean, let' face it.

1096
01:20:57,229 --> 01:21:00,721
Me being here to help
is like a cruel joke.

1097
01:21:13,678 --> 01:21:16,737
Not even heights
freak me out anymore.

1098
01:21:19,984 --> 01:21:22,111
You look a lot better.

1099
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:25,243
That's what everybody says.

1100
01:21:28,892 --> 01:21:30,791
You know, Lizzie...

1101
01:21:31,393 --> 01:21:33,095
...I'm fine.

1102
01:21:33,095 --> 01:21:37,400
And there's no reason why you
can't go back up to Cambridge.

1103
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:40,936
Mom, I've spoken with the nurses,
and they say that you need...

1104
01:21:40,936 --> 01:21:44,064
Honey, you've got exams
coming up.

1105
01:21:45,841 --> 01:21:49,277
You have to have somebody with you,
even if it's just a few days.

1106
01:21:49,277 --> 01:21:52,179
I can take care of myself.
I always have.

1107
01:21:54,116 --> 01:21:56,380
You're not going home alone.

1108
01:21:57,451 --> 01:21:58,853
It's the other cupboard.

1109
01:21:58,853 --> 01:22:01,556
I don't know.

1110
01:22:01,556 --> 01:22:03,252
Grandma.

1111
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:20,233
I don't know what I would have
done without Lizzie here.

1112
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:27,012
- None of this would've happened...
- Ma, don't say that.

1113
01:22:27,012 --> 01:22:30,378
...if it hadn't been for her.

1114
01:22:46,599 --> 01:22:48,700
They're gone.

1115
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:50,225
Yeah.

1116
01:22:51,169 --> 01:22:53,695
I didn't really feel like
saying goodbye.

1117
01:23:01,246 --> 01:23:04,977
After all this time,
I never asked you about Rafe.

1118
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:15,117
That's over.

1119
01:23:16,425 --> 01:23:18,094
He...

1120
01:23:18,094 --> 01:23:20,586
He never wants to see me again.

1121
01:23:26,268 --> 01:23:28,327
You know, when Donald left me...

1122
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:33,133
...it seemed so incredible.

1123
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:36,508
I just couldn't believe it.

1124
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:50,820
I think I just forgot about you, Lizzie.

1125
01:23:51,558 --> 01:23:53,150
You know?

1126
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:57,264
You were just a child.

1127
01:23:57,264 --> 01:24:00,701
So little.

1128
01:24:04,738 --> 01:24:06,865
But you needed me.

1129
01:24:08,842 --> 01:24:13,313
And that forced me
to pay attention again.

1130
01:24:13,313 --> 01:24:15,076
You know what I mean?

1131
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:19,883
I had to take care of you.

1132
01:24:22,354 --> 01:24:26,726
And in a way,
you brought me back to life...

1133
01:24:26,726 --> 01:24:29,922
...and you became everything
for me.

1134
01:24:31,363 --> 01:24:35,094
I was so wrapped up in you.

1135
01:24:39,838 --> 01:24:44,876
But God, you were so full
of promise, Lizzie.

1136
01:24:44,876 --> 01:24:49,745
And I wanted so much
for you in your life.

1137
01:24:51,582 --> 01:24:56,110
And I couldn't see
that it wasn't good for you.

1138
01:25:00,492 --> 01:25:02,481
You just...

1139
01:25:03,127 --> 01:25:05,527
I know you wanted me...

1140
01:25:06,097 --> 01:25:09,964
...to be everything, and I can't be.

1141
01:25:14,437 --> 01:25:16,699
I can't be.

1142
01:25:25,582 --> 01:25:27,242
Look, Lizzie.

1143
01:25:28,384 --> 01:25:31,716
You don't have
to be anything for me.

1144
01:25:32,187 --> 01:25:35,356
You don't have to be well for me.

1145
01:25:35,356 --> 01:25:37,290
You understand?

1146
01:25:39,861 --> 01:25:42,490
You don't have to pretend.

1147
01:25:46,466 --> 01:25:48,935
I'll be okay, Mom.

1148
01:25:52,573 --> 01:25:54,541
I'll be okay.

1149
01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:57,834
I promise.

1150
01:26:08,855 --> 01:26:10,753
I'll be okay.

1151
01:26:12,358 --> 01:26:14,450
And there' a reason.

1152
01:26:27,338 --> 01:26:31,297
I call this the crack house,
where I come to score.

1153
01:26:31,643 --> 01:26:34,305
Dr. Sterling is my dealer.

1154
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:39,246
It seems like everyone' doctor
is dealing this stuff now.

1155
01:26:40,885 --> 01:26:44,651
Sometimes it feels like we're
all living in a Prozac nation.

1156
01:26:45,155 --> 01:26:48,057
The United States of Depression.

1157
01:26:52,230 --> 01:26:54,595
I don't know who I am anymore.

1158
01:26:56,567 --> 01:26:58,933
I have this personality.

1159
01:26:59,635 --> 01:27:03,163
And it's fucked up, but it's me.

1160
01:27:04,307 --> 01:27:08,010
And I see myself becoming this
person who does the right thing...

1161
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:10,410
...who says the right thing...

1162
01:27:11,179 --> 01:27:12,582
...but that's not me.

1163
01:27:12,582 --> 01:27:15,785
- You feel different, don't you?
- Of course I feel different.

1164
01:27:15,785 --> 01:27:18,253
I'm on medication.
That's the point, isn't it?

1165
01:27:18,253 --> 01:27:20,245
Yeah, that was the point.

1166
01:27:20,556 --> 01:27:23,992
You're just not comfortable
with who this new person is yet.

1167
01:27:23,992 --> 01:27:26,561
But I can't be this person
without taking pills.

1168
01:27:26,561 --> 01:27:29,331
The pills are giving you
breathing space.

1169
01:27:29,331 --> 01:27:32,266
This feels like everything's
just being covered up.

1170
01:27:32,734 --> 01:27:36,070
I recommend you stay on the
medication, but it's not my choice.

1171
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:37,867
It's your choice.

1172
01:27:41,675 --> 01:27:43,666
Do you want to get off the pills?

1173
01:28:43,734 --> 01:28:45,201
Sweetheart, come here.

1174
01:28:45,201 --> 01:28:47,135
Come here, it's okay.

1175
01:28:47,537 --> 01:28:49,266
It's okay.

1176
01:29:20,602 --> 01:29:24,003
If only my life could be
more like the movies.

1177
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:27,909
I want an angel to swoop down
like he does to Jimmy Stewart...

1178
01:29:27,909 --> 01:29:31,709
...in It's a Wonderful Life
and talk me out of suicide.

1179
01:29:32,179 --> 01:29:35,617
I've always waited for that one
moment of truth to set me free...

1180
01:29:35,617 --> 01:29:38,086
...and change my life forever.

1181
01:29:38,086 --> 01:29:40,054
But he won't come.

1182
01:29:40,854 --> 01:29:43,322
It doesn't happen that way.

1183
01:29:45,726 --> 01:29:48,327
All the drugs, all the therapy...

1184
01:29:48,327 --> 01:29:53,633
...the fights, anger, guilt,
Rafe, suicidal thoughts.

1185
01:29:53,633 --> 01:29:56,935
All of that was part
of some slow recovery process.

1186
01:29:56,935 --> 01:30:00,171
The same way I went down,
I came back up...

1187
01:30:00,171 --> 01:30:03,630
...gradually, and then suddenly.

1188
01:30:08,247 --> 01:30:11,282
The pills weren't a cure-all,
God knows...

1189
01:30:11,282 --> 01:30:13,318
...but they gave me
breathing space...

1190
01:30:13,318 --> 01:30:15,620
...which allowed me
to start writing again.

1191
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:19,386
Only this time it wasn't
as if my life depended on it.

1192
