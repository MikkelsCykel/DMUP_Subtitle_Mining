1
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,448
Testing, testing.

2
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:22,280
Significance, harms,
inherency, topicality, solvency.

3
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:29,753
Quiet, please.
Cell phones off, please.

4
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,393
Judges ready?

5
00:00:40,436 --> 00:00:42,199
Timer ready?

6
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:43,671
The Affirmative
will please begin.

7
00:00:57,987 --> 00:01:00,251
It will come as no
surprise to the judges,

8
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:01,950
our esteemed opponents from
Townsend Prep,

9
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:02,980
nor really to anyone at all

10
00:01:03,025 --> 00:01:05,289
in the audience that we,
the Affirmative from Plainsboro High,

11
00:01:05,327 --> 00:01:08,387
do hereby support this year's
National Policy Debate Resolution,

12
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:11,400
which I am supposed to recite now,
as if after an entire school year

13
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:13,698
it could still somehow
be unknown to any of us.

14
00:01:13,736 --> 00:01:16,204
That is ridiculous. Therefore,
instead of senselessly repeating it,

15
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:19,036
I will offer up a moment of silence
during which I'd like every one of you

16
00:01:19,075 --> 00:01:22,841
to say the resolution aloud. It will be
a final communal act for all of us,

17
00:01:22,878 --> 00:01:25,642
the High School Policy Debaters
of New Jersey. Ready, set, go.

18
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:26,807
Resolved...

19
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:29,340
For those of you who aren't
done, I apologize,

20
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:31,376
but there's a reason why
I'm up here and you're down there,

21
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,388
and if you please, right now,
we're going to go at my pace.

22
00:01:33,422 --> 00:01:34,753
Hang on if you can.

23
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,586
Our plan today is succinct.

24
00:01:35,587 --> 00:01:36,883
Only by becoming a
fully socialist regime,

25
00:01:36,926 --> 00:01:38,154
will the United States government
ever emerge as the true moral leader

26
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:40,128
of the free world, and thus
create a lasting peace.

27
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:41,068
Therefore we support an amendment

28
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,221
to the Constitution of the United States

29
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:42,963
to outlaw all political parties

30
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:43,663
that do not embrace socialism

31
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:44,961
as their core philosophy.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,763
On the stage of
the New Jersey State

33
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:49,066
High School Policy
Debate Championships

34
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:52,074
that spring night
stood Ben Wekselbaum

35
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:54,633
of Plainsboro High.

36
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:56,474
To anyone
who ever heard Ben debate

37
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:59,709
there was one thing
that was undeniable:

38
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:02,080
He had a voice.

39
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:03,813
Even then,
on that May night,

40
00:02:03,853 --> 00:02:05,320
a real voice.

41
00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:07,219
You're all wondering,
"When on earth

42
00:02:07,256 --> 00:02:08,416
is he going to get to
farming subsidies?"

43
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:10,254
At long last the link to farming,
which is no doubt obvious by now,

44
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:13,352
agricultural societies collapse under
capitalism and thrive under socialism.

45
00:02:13,395 --> 00:02:15,420
And agriculture has always
been a necessary industry.

46
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:18,024
- Without agriculture...
- As Ben Wekselbaum

47
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:20,001
set out the complexities
of their plan,

48
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:23,095
his partner
was biding her time,

49
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:25,164
picturing how
it would look up there...

50
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:29,974
the only trophy missing from her
crowded, gleaming shelf.

51
00:02:30,012 --> 00:02:34,312
One team on the Affirmative,
arguing for the resolution.

52
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,410
The other on the Negative,
tearing it down.

53
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:38,545
This year's national resolution

54
00:02:38,587 --> 00:02:40,521
is specifically about farming
subsidies, not socialism.

55
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:41,534
By overstepping the resolution,

56
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:42,922
they haven't met their
prima fascie burden

57
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,153
to defend said resolution and
should be considered untopical.

58
00:02:45,194 --> 00:02:46,957
Subsidies are at their heart an
extension of socialism...

59
00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:47,985
that's from Gutierrez, '03.

60
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,463
That the negative team
has no legitimate arguments

61
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:50,487
against socialism isn't our fault.

62
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:52,364
They didn't penetrate the subject
as deeply as they should have.

63
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:54,130
To suggest that we haven't
refuted the very basis of socialism

64
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,865
is fallacious and specious.

65
00:02:55,905 --> 00:02:58,738
I refer you again to the quotes
my partner read regarding...

66
00:02:58,774 --> 00:03:00,674
And so it goes.
The high school debate,

67
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,352
like the war that rips
through your city

68
00:03:02,353 --> 00:03:03,872
and ravages everything in its path;

69
00:03:03,913 --> 00:03:07,849
Kids wielding words like weapons
and brandishing ideas like axes.

70
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:10,852
Nothing else mattered
in that final round.

71
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:13,252
There was no world
beyond it.

72
00:03:14,557 --> 00:03:16,047
Except that 46 miles away

73
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:20,255
Hal Hefner was at home...
just sitting at home

74
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:23,026
like nothing
or none of New Jersey

75
00:03:23,065 --> 00:03:24,760
was burning around him.

76
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,199
We're gonna have to
break up the set.

77
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:27,634
What am I gonna do?
Put it all in a garbage bag?

78
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,661
My stuff's not gonna
fit in a garbage bag.

79
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:31,935
- Yeah, put it in a garbage bag!
- Here, keep the deodorant.

80
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:33,381
Why don't you go down to the basement?

81
00:03:33,382 --> 00:03:34,602
There's another set down there.

82
00:03:34,643 --> 00:03:36,474
Quit slamming the drawers.

83
00:03:36,512 --> 00:03:38,173
- Oh, come on!
- You're gonna break the drawers.

84
00:03:38,214 --> 00:03:39,735
Give me a break. I'm taking this.

85
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:40,842
I hope you don't mind,

86
00:03:40,883 --> 00:03:42,714
because you took
everything else of mine.

87
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:46,812
On that May night Hal Hefner
had hardly a voice at all.

88
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:49,050
Charlotte.

89
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:49,786
...could you not do that?

90
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:51,286
Because I may have to come
back and get some stuff.

91
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:53,261
- See ya.
- No, no.

92
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:55,354
Don't take that bag.

93
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:01,759
Hey, Hal.
Earl, I'm...

94
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:05,638
I'm taking these. I'm not
going to be living here anymore

95
00:04:05,674 --> 00:04:10,236
and that's why I'm
taking the suitcases.

96
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:13,942
Just leave the big
bag with the rest of the set.

97
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:16,474
Lord, this is so you!

98
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:24,459
Here's your suitcase.

99
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:36,731
You guys are going
to be all right.

100
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:38,967
And I'll...

101
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:42,034
I'll see you
sometime soon.

102
00:04:42,077 --> 00:04:44,307
I don't know
what else to say.

103
00:04:44,346 --> 00:04:47,406
I can't put it into words.

104
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:03,362
Back on the stage of
the State Championships

105
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,424
the night at last
revealed itself

106
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:07,560
as not just any night,

107
00:05:07,603 --> 00:05:11,733
but as the night,
the night when it all began.

108
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:15,301
Ben Wekselbaum, the best
voice to ever debate for PHS,

109
00:05:15,344 --> 00:05:17,073
Plainsboro High,

110
00:05:17,112 --> 00:05:19,273
according to anyone
who ever heard him...

111
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:21,340
that Ben Wekselbaum,

112
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:23,044
he just went quiet.

113
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:25,610
Our next advantage basically says
that human relations can only thrive

114
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:27,246
in an atmosphere
of total equality.

115
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:29,280
That human relations
can only exist...

116
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:35,326
Sorry, I just said that.

117
00:05:35,364 --> 00:05:37,355
Wait, wait, wait.

118
00:05:58,287 --> 00:05:59,948
Ben?

119
00:06:08,697 --> 00:06:12,326
46 miles apart,
at the very same moment,

120
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:14,359
all the arguments
stopped.

121
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:20,634
So there was this bridge
of silence spanning New Jersey.

122
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:25,405
No shouting
from Hal's parents,

123
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:27,312
no debating, no voice.

124
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:29,340
No one's voice at all.

125
00:06:37,226 --> 00:06:41,424
That year's National Debate
topic was farming subsidies.

126
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:43,522
And if you don't know
how farming subsidies

127
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:45,294
could inspire all this commotion,

128
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:46,801
then you don't know life

129
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:49,668
and there's nothing
that can be said about it.

130
00:06:49,705 --> 00:06:53,801
Suitcases end marriages and
farming subsidies launch cataclysms.

131
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:09,952
Can a voice travel
from one person to another,

132
00:07:09,992 --> 00:07:12,586
like yawning or mono?

133
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,455
Sure it can.
That's our position:

134
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:19,967
That the will to speak
traveled that night

135
00:07:20,002 --> 00:07:22,800
across the dark
New Jersey highways

136
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:25,636
until it arrived
on this very block,

137
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:28,142
where it would
take up residence,

138
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:31,340
or try to,
in someone new.

139
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,175
Gladys, let's go!

140
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,201
Timeliness is
an important part of it.

141
00:08:05,214 --> 00:08:07,341
- Heston.
- Earl.

142
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:17,284
I'll just have the...
just the...

143
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:20,159
just the...
just the...

144
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:23,858
just the pizza,
thanks.

145
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:25,560
Thank you.

146
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:33,436
What kind of a name
is O. Henry?

147
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,278
Not a pseudonym,
that we all know;

148
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:45,912
but...?

149
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:49,150
How about
nom de plume?

150
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:51,751
Does nom de plume
sound right?

151
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:52,882
It sounds right to me.

152
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:54,762
It was toward the end of the reading

153
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:57,230
that no one seems
to have completed.

154
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:59,996
Open your books
to page 248.

155
00:09:00,035 --> 00:09:02,731
Let's do the reading that should
have been done last night.

156
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:04,671
Fish or pizza?

157
00:09:04,706 --> 00:09:06,799
Yeah, I'll have the pizza.

158
00:09:11,747 --> 00:09:13,806
Fish or pizza?

159
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:16,477
I'll have the...

160
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:18,782
The pizza's plain or pep.

161
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,050
Fish is... not sure.

162
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:23,148
Like general fish.

163
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:24,249
Yeah, I'll have the...

164
00:09:24,293 --> 00:09:25,282
the... the...

165
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:27,761
the, uh...

166
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:31,232
the... not...
not the...

167
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:32,824
I'll just... just...

168
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:35,632
- just...
- The fish?

169
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:41,773
The general fish...

170
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,141
please.

171
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:45,806
Come back for seconds.
Plenty left.

172
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:48,008
Thank you, ma'am.

173
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,041
- Fish or pizza?
- Pizza.

174
00:10:20,682 --> 00:10:23,810
Do you want to keep on
trying the breathing exercises,

175
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:27,310
or something new?

176
00:10:27,356 --> 00:10:30,723
Is it all right
if I... if I

177
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,659
don't have an opinion?

178
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:34,321
Let's try this.

179
00:10:34,363 --> 00:10:36,524
I read in this journal,

180
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:39,090
"Clinical Pathways
to Speech Pathology,"

181
00:10:39,134 --> 00:10:43,628
that it's hard
to be anything but fluent

182
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:47,733
when you whisper
or sing.

183
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:51,143
I sent away for a videotape
of some people trying that out.

184
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:53,477
Not a solution,
obviously,

185
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:57,178
but wanna give it
a shot?

186
00:10:57,219 --> 00:11:01,053
I can't... I can't...
I can't...

187
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:04,616
I can't do this.

188
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,788
Isn't this
too stupid, Honoria?

189
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:10,593
Even for Honoria.

190
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:13,100
This is too stupid.
I can just feel it.

191
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:15,797
I explained this, Hal,
that this is not my specialty.

192
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:18,101
I'm sorry, I'm trying.

193
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,268
It's really a shame
that you're not hyperactive,

194
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:24,244
because that I know well.

195
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:28,443
And that I can
work miracles with...

196
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:31,179
hyperactivity.

197
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:32,811
But...

198
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:35,948
back to breathing.
Yeah?

199
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:37,481
Breathe.

200
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:46,794
Good, come on.

201
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:49,030
It was 1858,

202
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:52,507
and while Senator Stephen Douglas
set out his case

203
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,738
that states ought to choose
whether to allow slavery,

204
00:11:55,777 --> 00:11:58,405
Abraham Lincoln consulted

205
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:00,574
with the smart
citizens of Illinois

206
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:02,139
to plot his answer.

207
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:03,776
Lincoln's a chick.

208
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:05,946
Let me find now a citizen

209
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:08,649
to assist me in coming up
with arguments

210
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,920
against Senator Douglas.

211
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,725
Where can I find
such a citizen helper?

212
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:23,260
The commoner in the
striped plum-colored shirt...

213
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:25,569
we need you, sir.

214
00:12:25,607 --> 00:12:27,438
Rise to your duty.

215
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:34,882
- Come on!
- Get up there.

216
00:12:45,093 --> 00:12:47,425
My assistant has come
to offer me arguments

217
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:50,761
in my debate
against the Senator.

218
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,290
Ha!
Now I'm quaking.

219
00:12:54,436 --> 00:12:58,668
What cannot a house
divided against itself do?

220
00:12:58,707 --> 00:13:03,167
It is this argument
that will lead me to victory.

221
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:05,941
What cannot it do?

222
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:15,383
Uh...

223
00:13:15,423 --> 00:13:17,584
it... it...

224
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:20,686
Hold it further away
from your mouth.

225
00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:24,165
What cannot
a house divided do?

226
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:29,036
It can't...

227
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,562
can't st...

228
00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:34,541
can't... can't...

229
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:38,068
Mr. President...

230
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:42,607
a house divided can't...

231
00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:45,381
Some help
from the citizenry.

232
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,183
It can't stand.

233
00:13:47,222 --> 00:13:49,918
I thought it would
shit itself.

234
00:13:51,426 --> 00:13:53,257
Thank you.

235
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:55,820
How about a round of applause
for the good commoner?

236
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:59,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
the silence

237
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:03,994
with which you have listened to
Mr. Lincoln during his hour...

238
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:06,030
You look taller onstage.

239
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:35,461
Agnes.

240
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:39,496
Agnes. Agnes.

241
00:14:40,876 --> 00:14:43,572
Agnes.

242
00:14:43,612 --> 00:14:47,173
I'm trying
not to listen, okay?

243
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:50,412
Distinctly not to... you're like
one foot away, so just...

244
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:53,250
Do you wanna
hear your problem?

245
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:55,483
You've no agenda.

246
00:14:55,523 --> 00:14:57,753
Strictly head-in-
the-ground material.

247
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,783
Look at me.
Look at me.

248
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:02,058
I wake up every morning
and what do I do?

249
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:03,655
I create an agenda
for the day,

250
00:15:03,698 --> 00:15:05,757
which is a sub-agenda
for the month,

251
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,963
which is in itself
a pie sl...

252
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:10,767
which is in itself
a pie slice

253
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:13,365
of my agenda
for life.

254
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:20,143
Do you want to hear
my purpose for today?

255
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:22,672
L... uh, I...
no.

256
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:26,813
L... I...
I can assure you

257
00:15:26,855 --> 00:15:29,619
that I absolutely
do not.

258
00:15:29,658 --> 00:15:32,126
Probably call the cops
on me anyway.

259
00:15:34,262 --> 00:15:36,162
Hey, Adolf,
switch with me.

260
00:15:36,197 --> 00:15:37,755
Upsy-daisy.

261
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,323
This is my seat.

262
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:40,994
Like all seats
on this vehicle,

263
00:15:41,036 --> 00:15:43,334
yours has been paid
for with taxpayer money.

264
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:45,202
Which means that I
or anyone else

265
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,037
has just as much right
to it as you do.

266
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:48,702
In fact, given
the distinction

267
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:50,938
between what your family
surely pays in taxes and mine,

268
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:54,244
I think it's safe to say the seat
is substantially more mine than yours.

269
00:15:54,282 --> 00:15:56,273
Do you see now?

270
00:15:56,318 --> 00:15:59,116
I'll be taking just a minute to talk
to the little man,

271
00:15:59,154 --> 00:16:01,987
and then you can go on borrowing
my seat for as long as you like

272
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:03,854
until I want it again,
right?

273
00:16:15,036 --> 00:16:16,867
Coach Lumbly,
with the pilgrim hat,

274
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:19,032
she teaches patterns
of adult living.

275
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:22,168
She's on her third husband,
name of Wallace Lumbly. Wallace III.

276
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,338
It's a particular pattern she
doesn't lecture us on in class.

277
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,407
Anyway, she came up to me after
a presentation on egalitarianism

278
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:32,682
and said that although my argumentative
skills were at the fetal stage,

279
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:36,088
she sensed, somehow she
intuited my potential

280
00:16:36,124 --> 00:16:38,058
and she invited me
on the team.

281
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:41,494
So now here I am two years later
doing the same thing with you...

282
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:43,520
recruiting,

283
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:46,398
ferreting out the debating
talent from the masses.

284
00:16:46,434 --> 00:16:48,527
That's you.

285
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:51,070
I've ferreted you.

286
00:16:51,106 --> 00:16:54,200
You mean...
you mean

287
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:56,870
public speaking?
Like, speaking...

288
00:16:56,911 --> 00:16:58,242
in public?

289
00:17:01,282 --> 00:17:03,876
No, I don't think that's...
that's not... that's not very...

290
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:05,146
Resolved that
the federal government

291
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:06,653
should support the
teaching of abstinence

292
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:09,350
in public schools...
from sex.

293
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:11,882
It's a big step up
from farming.

294
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:14,258
That was last year's
resolution.

295
00:17:14,295 --> 00:17:16,229
Yeah, I know.

296
00:17:17,632 --> 00:17:19,361
Suit yourself.

297
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:21,130
But deformed people
are the best.

298
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:24,138
Maybe it's because they
have a deep resource of anger.

299
00:17:24,172 --> 00:17:25,605
It serves them well.

300
00:17:30,311 --> 00:17:31,972
Were you trying
to say thank you?

301
00:17:32,013 --> 00:17:34,948
I thought you might be
stuck trying to say thank you.

302
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:39,253
You're welcome.

303
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:53,489
I'm sure this is
awkward for the boys.

304
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:57,828
Not one bit.
Not one single bit.

305
00:18:57,866 --> 00:19:00,733
I swear I'm more nervous
than anyone.

306
00:19:00,768 --> 00:19:03,396
Honestly, Jules,
I'm a small-claims judge.

307
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:06,271
It's lucky I'm not dating
someone from Trenton.

308
00:19:11,546 --> 00:19:15,073
Is this a traditional
Korean dish?

309
00:19:15,116 --> 00:19:18,517
Because it has an
exotic odor.

310
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:23,656
Uh, that's
tuna casserole.

311
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:40,139
Use your finger!

312
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:42,234
Shut up!

313
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:47,042
My dad hasn't dated anyone
before your mom for six years.

314
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:48,605
Can, uh...

315
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,744
can we just
not talk about that?

316
00:19:55,857 --> 00:19:58,553
I got this by
a tree stump in the park.

317
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:06,232
Look at this one.

318
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,201
Fire!

319
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:14,300
Then on Thursday...

320
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:16,674
it could have been
any day but it wasn't;

321
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:19,009
it was Thursday...

322
00:20:19,047 --> 00:20:21,572
for no good reason,
something happened.

323
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:24,585
And it was like a little wave
breaking over him.

324
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:26,814
Take aim...

325
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:31,991
And it said the name

326
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:34,586
G- I-N-N-Y.

327
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:36,062
Ginny.

328
00:20:36,097 --> 00:20:38,827
The wave said
the name Ginny.

329
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:40,231
Over and over.

330
00:20:40,268 --> 00:20:42,099
- Ginny, Ginny, Ginny...
- Fire!

331
00:20:45,273 --> 00:20:47,298
Zero points, Hal Hefner.

332
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:48,900
Ginny.

333
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:50,877
The etymology of the word
spreading is unclear

334
00:20:50,912 --> 00:20:52,379
but we believe it to be
a blending together

335
00:20:52,413 --> 00:20:53,641
of speed and reading,
spreading.

336
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:56,980
All it is is jamming as many arguments
into your time as you humanly can.

337
00:20:57,018 --> 00:20:59,953
Here we go... the effects
of early sexual relations

338
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:02,081
include transition of diseases,
out-of-wedlock pregnancies

339
00:21:02,123 --> 00:21:03,988
and a host of potential
illnesses...

340
00:21:05,393 --> 00:21:07,554
a host of potential illnesses
including depression

341
00:21:07,595 --> 00:21:09,586
and low self-esteem.
Consider contention one earlier.

342
00:21:09,631 --> 00:21:12,623
Participation in the program is 53%
more likely to yield positive results.

343
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,794
You know, the other thing
that I wanted to tell you

344
00:21:14,836 --> 00:21:17,236
is that you even look
like this guy I used to debate with...

345
00:21:17,272 --> 00:21:18,864
in a shorter,
goofier kind of way.

346
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:21,397
And what would you be doing
here looking enough like this guy

347
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:24,900
if it wasn't for me to discover you
and what talents are hidden within?

348
00:21:24,946 --> 00:21:28,210
Hi.

349
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:32,409
Resolved that Hal Hefner should
really stop letting the world

350
00:21:32,453 --> 00:21:34,785
tell him what's possible and try
and figure it out for himself.

351
00:21:34,822 --> 00:21:36,414
Maybe that's a
life's philosophy

352
00:21:36,457 --> 00:21:38,652
suited just to some of
us who cherish winning.

353
00:21:38,693 --> 00:21:42,288
So maybe it's not for you,
but I think that it is.

354
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,128
The quality of life among
teens who refrain...

355
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,577
Before this,

356
00:21:57,612 --> 00:22:00,080
there was the nothingness
of Plainsboro, New Jersey.

357
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:02,912
But now Hal Hefner suddenly
had only one thought.

358
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,545
And it felt like all his life his brain
had been waiting for this thought,

359
00:22:06,587 --> 00:22:08,782
so comfortably now
did it fit in

360
00:22:08,823 --> 00:22:10,984
and take up
all the room there was.

361
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:13,425
You're on
my street.

362
00:22:17,965 --> 00:22:20,433
You're still on
my street.

363
00:22:20,468 --> 00:22:24,234
Do you... do you have
any idea what public property is?

364
00:22:24,272 --> 00:22:25,864
We'll see.

365
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:41,486
My mom, Fern, says
it's public property,

366
00:22:41,522 --> 00:22:44,582
and if it's okay with your mom
you can come have 7-Up with me,

367
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,059
but the icemaker's
busted, so...

368
00:23:03,244 --> 00:23:05,007
Hi.

369
00:23:06,347 --> 00:23:08,474
You want to sit down
and listen to an old couple

370
00:23:08,516 --> 00:23:11,076
work on their marriage
through some music therapy?

371
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,316
I'm upstairs!

372
00:23:14,355 --> 00:23:16,084
Uh, uh...

373
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:18,888
uh, no thanks.
Not... not... not today.

374
00:23:28,202 --> 00:23:32,161
I have a request in for binoculars
for my 12th birthday, so...

375
00:23:32,206 --> 00:23:34,970
we'll see about that.

376
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:38,843
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

377
00:23:43,684 --> 00:23:45,845
Who, uh...

378
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:47,286
who is that?

379
00:23:47,321 --> 00:23:50,984
Beats me. Hey, do you know
if she wears a bra?

380
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:56,054
Wanna see a bra?

381
00:24:05,673 --> 00:24:09,336
Yeah, uh... I should...
I should really...

382
00:24:09,377 --> 00:24:11,140
I should... should...

383
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:13,374
I should really probably
go home now, Lewis.

384
00:24:13,414 --> 00:24:15,041
Okay.

385
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:44,976
Uh, Judge Pete?

386
00:24:45,012 --> 00:24:47,412
Judge Pete?
Your Honor?

387
00:24:47,448 --> 00:24:49,040
- Hm?
- Do you...

388
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:52,052
know any, uh,
do you know any lawyers...

389
00:24:52,086 --> 00:24:55,419
great lawyers who
can't talk very well?

390
00:24:55,456 --> 00:24:58,186
Not... not fluent,
but yet great lawyers

391
00:24:58,226 --> 00:25:00,854
whose clients don't end
up getting the chair?

392
00:25:00,895 --> 00:25:04,422
Uh...

393
00:25:04,465 --> 00:25:07,366
Oh, there's a bailiff with
a prosthetic leg.

394
00:25:16,811 --> 00:25:18,403
What are
you thinking, Laverne?

395
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:28,613
Hi.

396
00:25:30,091 --> 00:25:32,355
I, uh... I talked
to Ms...

397
00:25:32,393 --> 00:25:35,760
to Mrs...
which is it, anyway?

398
00:25:35,796 --> 00:25:37,991
To... to uh...

399
00:25:38,032 --> 00:25:39,829
to the coach,
and, um,

400
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:43,803
I'm... I'm... I'm gonna
come inside for debate prep now,

401
00:25:43,838 --> 00:25:45,430
uh, thanks to you.

402
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:48,438
Someone took something
of mine.

403
00:25:50,311 --> 00:25:53,246
I had a locket. I had
a 24-karat gold deco locket

404
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:55,806
with two pictures inside.
Is this ringing any bells?

405
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,216
One was of me, the other
was of someone else...

406
00:25:58,252 --> 00:25:59,947
a boy, of sorts.

407
00:25:59,987 --> 00:26:02,547
What's a...
a deco?

408
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,320
My mother believes that one
of her pseudo friends stole it,

409
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,623
because he, or even she,
is secretly a pedophile

410
00:26:07,662 --> 00:26:10,290
and wanted the locket
to stare into or suck on

411
00:26:10,331 --> 00:26:12,595
or utilize for other
specific erotic purposes.

412
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:15,295
But I told her that
I have this hunch...

413
00:26:15,336 --> 00:26:16,860
I have this
womanly hunch

414
00:26:16,904 --> 00:26:19,896
that it was taken out of my
backpack by someone at P.H.S.

415
00:26:19,941 --> 00:26:22,705
It's like I sensed it leaving
my presence. Just an ounce...

416
00:26:22,743 --> 00:26:25,337
but a burning ounce
as it left my person.

417
00:26:25,379 --> 00:26:28,837
Well, I don't... I don't think
that the pedophile thing could be true.

418
00:26:28,883 --> 00:26:31,545
Not that I, uh, even really
know anything about that.

419
00:26:31,586 --> 00:26:34,578
But, I just don't
believe that anyone

420
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:37,147
would really think
of you like that.

421
00:26:37,191 --> 00:26:38,283
Like what?

422
00:26:38,326 --> 00:26:41,784
I mean, just, uh,
sexually, I mean.

423
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:46,963
That's the worst thing
anyone's ever said to me.

424
00:26:48,502 --> 00:26:50,493
- Wait, no!
- I can't believe you said that.

425
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:51,800
No no, I didn't...
no...

426
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:53,568
I never should have
asked you to join the team.

427
00:26:53,608 --> 00:26:55,735
God only knows
what I was thinking.

428
00:26:55,776 --> 00:26:57,403
But, I didn't...
no...

429
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:10,756
Earl.

430
00:28:02,677 --> 00:28:04,338
Thief.

431
00:28:21,095 --> 00:28:23,563
- Yes?
- L...

432
00:28:23,597 --> 00:28:24,962
here, I...
I stole it.

433
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:27,695
Shouldn't you be
at school?

434
00:28:41,015 --> 00:28:43,711
- You took the locket, you weaselhead!
- Get out!

435
00:28:43,751 --> 00:28:45,480
You left my theft box
a shit-faced mess.

436
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,180
Don't ever touch
the stuff I steal!

437
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:49,052
I mean it!
I steal it, it's mine!

438
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,081
You should put that on
your business card!

439
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,116
I'm gonna tan your hide,
you fake thief!

440
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,650
You God-awful
make-believe thief!

441
00:28:54,695 --> 00:28:56,162
Judge Pete is gonna
lock you up.

442
00:28:56,197 --> 00:28:57,824
Get your own
motherf'ing plan!

443
00:28:57,865 --> 00:28:59,696
If you tell anyone
I stole it,

444
00:28:59,734 --> 00:29:01,634
I'm going to wipe my ass with your
Chapstick,

445
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:04,160
and I'm gonna reach in your
eye sockets and tear out your pancreas.

446
00:29:04,205 --> 00:29:07,038
I'm hiding my theft box
where you'll never find it.

447
00:29:07,074 --> 00:29:09,167
This is ridiculous!

448
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,735
And stay out!

449
00:29:32,867 --> 00:29:34,801
It's for you, Annabelle.

450
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,906
Uh...

451
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:45,241
uh, he... uh...

452
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,941
Is this the
Hefner mansion?

453
00:29:50,184 --> 00:29:52,846
Um, uh, I...

454
00:29:52,887 --> 00:29:54,252
yeah, uh,

455
00:29:54,288 --> 00:29:56,722
can you... can you
hold on for a second?

456
00:29:56,757 --> 00:29:59,726
I'm just gonna, um...
uh...

457
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,161
I'm just gonna move.
But stay on.

458
00:30:03,197 --> 00:30:05,165
You can hang up now,
Earl.

459
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:07,167
You can hang up
now, Earl.

460
00:30:07,201 --> 00:30:10,295
Oh, okay.
You're the boss of me.

461
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,070
The boy whose picture
I keep in the locket that you stole,

462
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,600
did you see him?

463
00:30:17,645 --> 00:30:19,840
Uh, yeah, he...

464
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,905
His name's Ben Wekselbaum.
We debated together

465
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:23,780
until he freaked out at
the final round at States

466
00:30:23,818 --> 00:30:25,809
and left me with a lousy
second-place trophy.

467
00:30:25,853 --> 00:30:27,718
I've never felt
anything like that.

468
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:30,349
Have you ever felt like you
could burn the world down?

469
00:30:30,391 --> 00:30:32,484
Every day.

470
00:30:34,795 --> 00:30:36,387
Well, he dropped out
of high school

471
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,193
and though he never did
have the decency to call,

472
00:30:38,232 --> 00:30:40,393
I heard through the grapevine
that his grandmother got him a job

473
00:30:40,434 --> 00:30:43,164
at the world-renowned Louise
dry-cleaners in Trenton.

474
00:30:43,204 --> 00:30:46,696
L... yeah, I don't think
that I've ever heard of it.

475
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,232
Right. Anyway,
ultimately it's a good thing

476
00:30:50,277 --> 00:30:52,507
that the spirit of cowardliness
overtook Ben Wekselbaum,

477
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:55,515
because it has one: Left my
partner arrangement free this year,

478
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:57,414
and two: Allowed me to find
someone that I can mold

479
00:30:57,451 --> 00:30:59,817
into the kind of bare-knuckles
debater that I want to debate with.

480
00:30:59,854 --> 00:31:01,845
The best debaters are
the ones with something to prove...

481
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:04,050
I, trying to rise above
the fiasco of last year's States,

482
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:05,319
and you trying to prove
to the world

483
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:07,156
that you're not as retarded
as you sometimes sound.

484
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:09,162
Which is why I want you to
overlook the embarrassment

485
00:31:09,196 --> 00:31:11,892
that comes with having taken my locket
and join up with the team after all.

486
00:31:11,932 --> 00:31:13,729
You're on dishes tonight,
Virginia.

487
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:15,758
I'm on an important
phone call, is what I'm on.

488
00:31:15,803 --> 00:31:18,363
They're all important calls
in the world of Virginia Ryerson.

489
00:31:18,405 --> 00:31:20,600
I have to go. I'll see you
at my house on Saturday.

490
00:31:20,641 --> 00:31:22,905
- You're helping me with research.
- Yeah, oh, uh...

491
00:31:25,012 --> 00:31:28,106
Ginny, are you...
are you still there?

492
00:31:28,148 --> 00:31:30,582
Oh, I am, Katherine, yes,
and it's a good thing I am.

493
00:31:30,618 --> 00:31:31,607
Earl!

494
00:31:31,652 --> 00:31:33,210
If you think you're gonna
get a long-term girlfriend

495
00:31:33,254 --> 00:31:35,814
without my permission,
you got another think coming.

496
00:31:35,856 --> 00:31:37,847
You'll never sleep
safe again. Not ever.

497
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:40,622
Don't do it, little shit!
Don't do it!

498
00:31:58,379 --> 00:32:00,574
Try not to steal
anything if you can.

499
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:24,271
Cut it out
and come inside.

500
00:32:26,941 --> 00:32:28,806
Close the door
behind you.

501
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:34,575
Sit down. You're finding me
quotes in the affirmative.

502
00:32:47,962 --> 00:32:50,328
So, uh...

503
00:32:51,832 --> 00:32:55,859
what do... what do you believe in
when it comes to abstinence?

504
00:32:55,903 --> 00:32:58,133
Top debaters never really
believe in anything.

505
00:32:58,172 --> 00:33:00,367
It gets in the way of
arguing from both sides.

506
00:33:00,407 --> 00:33:02,307
But I mean, like,

507
00:33:02,343 --> 00:33:05,244
for you, like
in your own life.

508
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,612
Debate is life. You shouldn't
think about it in any other context.

509
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:11,743
Because in my mind, I don't...
I don't really think it's...

510
00:33:11,785 --> 00:33:14,049
a very good idea.
Abstinence, I mean.

511
00:33:14,088 --> 00:33:17,251
Because, um,
I just...

512
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:19,350
don't think it's
a very good idea,

513
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:21,054
not for kids
in New Jersey.

514
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:27,059
Okay, well, that's enough
tangential bullshit.

515
00:33:27,101 --> 00:33:29,934
Write down these template
arguments against abstinence:

516
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,530
One, supporting it violates the
barrier between church and state;

517
00:33:32,573 --> 00:33:34,541
Two, it's an enforcement
of a dated, sexist agenda;

518
00:33:34,575 --> 00:33:36,907
Three, sexual freedom is
the basis of human freedom;

519
00:33:36,944 --> 00:33:39,435
Four, it separates us from
Western cultures, Europe in particular,

520
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,675
when we should be drawing closer
to our international allies;

521
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:44,081
Five, psychologists say
that repressed sexual functions

522
00:33:44,118 --> 00:33:45,210
can create adult neuroses;

523
00:33:45,252 --> 00:33:47,220
Six, abstinence programs
actually increase

524
00:33:47,254 --> 00:33:48,846
risky sexual behavior
among teens;

525
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:51,084
Seven, it creates barriers
between free- love-generation parents

526
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:52,820
and their more
conservative children;

527
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,693
Eight, and finally, we oppose
abstinence because the world might end

528
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:58,698
and then basically everyone
we know dies a virgin.

529
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:01,360
Wow.

530
00:34:01,402 --> 00:34:05,031
Yeah, all those when
you think about it.

531
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:10,076
In preparation for our first official
debate exercise next week

532
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,578
show me that you can argue
in favor of abstinence.

533
00:34:12,613 --> 00:34:14,638
Well, um...

534
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:18,344
I think I may be better arguing
from from the other side of this.

535
00:34:18,385 --> 00:34:20,376
How.

536
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:22,949
Um...

537
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,322
the only one that I could...
that I could really...

538
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,954
that I could really
come up with was...

539
00:34:28,996 --> 00:34:33,262
that, uh, love is...
it's more special

540
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,292
when you...
when you do find it.

541
00:34:36,336 --> 00:34:39,237
The special-love case.

542
00:34:39,273 --> 00:34:42,333
Probably that stinks,
but I'll think about it some more

543
00:34:42,376 --> 00:34:44,276
and we'll see.

544
00:35:05,432 --> 00:35:09,596
Dad says he and Mom have done
every one of these at least twice,

545
00:35:09,636 --> 00:35:12,127
and some as many as
100 times.

546
00:35:12,172 --> 00:35:14,163
But he says no one's
keeping count,

547
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:15,675
which seems like
a big waste

548
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:18,974
'cause he could be the
Kama Sutra Barry Bonds or something

549
00:35:19,012 --> 00:35:21,003
and no one would
even know it.

550
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:28,653
Yeah, I tried this one with my pants on
on Winchester, our old dog.

551
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:32,022
But he wouldn't sit still
and he died a month later.

552
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:56,843
Mmm, hot
and spicy.

553
00:36:24,711 --> 00:36:27,874
Descartes.
Man, oh man.

554
00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:32,810
Hey, would you be interested
in joining my club?

555
00:36:32,853 --> 00:36:35,083
The Junior Philosophers.

556
00:36:36,456 --> 00:36:38,424
Oh, uh,
well, I uh...

557
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:40,949
I... my plate
is kind of full.

558
00:36:40,994 --> 00:36:42,621
I know what
you're thinking.

559
00:36:42,663 --> 00:36:45,655
We read everything,
but no Hagel,

560
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:48,031
if that's your concern.

561
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:53,006
No, uh, actually
I'm waiting for a girl.

562
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:55,668
That girl.

563
00:37:04,418 --> 00:37:06,215
You know what you can
do for me right now

564
00:37:06,253 --> 00:37:08,813
is write up
some more flow charts.

565
00:37:08,855 --> 00:37:10,914
Oh, thanks.

566
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:12,721
Okay.

567
00:37:26,106 --> 00:37:27,835
Once I was your age,

568
00:37:27,874 --> 00:37:31,275
just as quiet on the inside
as most of you novice debaters are.

569
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:33,245
Quiet as a mouse.

570
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,941
Or a stone.

571
00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:38,244
Or a bowl of pudding.

572
00:37:38,285 --> 00:37:41,914
And then I saw my first debate
and the pudding was no more.

573
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:44,924
None of you novices
understands me now. You will.

574
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,949
Until then, the thing
to remember

575
00:37:46,994 --> 00:37:49,258
is there are rules
that must be followed.

576
00:37:49,296 --> 00:37:50,593
That's debate.

577
00:37:50,631 --> 00:37:52,462
And that's life.

578
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:56,196
Our exercise today is an accelerated
run-through of a complete debate round

579
00:37:56,236 --> 00:37:57,760
to teach you
those rules.

580
00:37:57,804 --> 00:37:59,795
Why is the Hal Hefner
bowl of pudding

581
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,398
allowed to
demonstrate to us?

582
00:38:01,441 --> 00:38:03,807
Uh, he's first year,
that's true, but Miss Ryerson

583
00:38:03,844 --> 00:38:05,675
has assured me that
he's a quick study

584
00:38:05,712 --> 00:38:09,648
and a rare talent, and he will
instruct and enlighten us today.

585
00:38:09,683 --> 00:38:11,878
Our debate begins with
Ginny, the First Affirmative,

586
00:38:11,918 --> 00:38:13,909
delivering an eight-minute
opening speech.

587
00:38:13,954 --> 00:38:17,685
For our purposes, Ginny will
synopsize that down to 10 seconds.

588
00:38:17,724 --> 00:38:21,160
Good afternoon,
ladies and germs.

589
00:38:21,194 --> 00:38:22,752
Our Affirmative case today
in effect states

590
00:38:22,796 --> 00:38:24,127
that increased
teenage pregnancies

591
00:38:24,164 --> 00:38:26,359
will eventually bankrupt
Social Security, destroy the economy

592
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,163
and result in
the Third World War.

593
00:38:28,201 --> 00:38:30,499
Therefore, we will quadruple the
federal spending given only to schools

594
00:38:30,537 --> 00:38:32,027
that teach abstinence
to their students. Thank you.

595
00:38:32,072 --> 00:38:34,040
That was lucid, thank you.

596
00:38:34,074 --> 00:38:35,974
Now there's a two-minute
cross-examination,

597
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:37,670
Second Negative
to First Affirmative.

598
00:38:37,711 --> 00:38:39,804
Crystal Hamish-Steinberg
is the Second Negative.

599
00:38:39,846 --> 00:38:42,314
Crystal Hamish-Steinberg, would you
give us an exemplary question

600
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:43,907
that you would ask?

601
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,510
Have you ever heard
of Bangladesh?

602
00:38:46,553 --> 00:38:48,487
The perfect tease.

603
00:38:48,522 --> 00:38:51,286
Now the women may sit
while the First Negative rises

604
00:38:51,325 --> 00:38:53,987
to respond to Ginny.
Phillip?

605
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:55,927
Rather than attack
the Affirmative case,

606
00:38:55,962 --> 00:38:58,863
Crystal Hamish-Steinberg and I propose
the following Negative counterplan:

607
00:38:58,899 --> 00:39:00,867
We grant all the harms
claimed by the Affirmative,

608
00:39:00,901 --> 00:39:03,495
but state that the better way
to combat teenage pregnancy

609
00:39:03,537 --> 00:39:05,402
is by pouring money into
a huge rock concert

610
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:07,532
that we'll call the
"Concert for Sexlessness. "

611
00:39:07,574 --> 00:39:09,201
Thank you.

612
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:13,474
Now the First Affirmative
cross-examines the First Negative.

613
00:39:13,513 --> 00:39:17,142
Do you have statistics on how many
rock stars practice abstinence?

614
00:39:17,184 --> 00:39:18,771
How many rock stars in the historic

615
00:39:18,772 --> 00:39:20,676
Concert for Bangladesh were Bangladeshi?

616
00:39:20,721 --> 00:39:22,211
I'll ask the questions
here, Phillip.

617
00:39:22,255 --> 00:39:23,654
The combatants
sit.

618
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,057
Now Hal Hefner wows us
with his Second Affirmative,

619
00:39:27,094 --> 00:39:31,087
another eight-minute speech
boiled down here to 10 seconds.

620
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,563
Uh...

621
00:39:37,604 --> 00:39:39,936
There were three immediate
lines of argumentation

622
00:39:39,973 --> 00:39:42,737
that came to mind.
But the best one went like this:

623
00:39:42,776 --> 00:39:45,006
The plans are not
mutually exclusive.

624
00:39:45,045 --> 00:39:47,240
Increased funding for
school programs

625
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,612
doesn't preclude the
Negative team's badly named

626
00:39:49,649 --> 00:39:51,776
"Concert for Sexlessness. "

627
00:39:51,818 --> 00:39:53,877
The government can
and should do them both.

628
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,889
Uh, the...

629
00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:06,293
Hal Hefner visualized
himself in that moment

630
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:08,301
as the kind of kid
who can state,

631
00:40:08,335 --> 00:40:09,996
"The plans are not
mutually exclusive,"

632
00:40:10,036 --> 00:40:12,300
whenever he wants
to say so.

633
00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:14,569
The plans are not
mutually exclusive.

634
00:40:14,608 --> 00:40:16,906
The plans are not...
no, they are...

635
00:40:16,943 --> 00:40:19,343
they are not
mutually exclusive.

636
00:40:24,618 --> 00:40:26,552
I'll be handling Hal Hefner's
cross-ex and rebuttal

637
00:40:26,586 --> 00:40:27,743
until the first actual debate

638
00:40:27,744 --> 00:40:29,419
tournament against other actual schools.

639
00:40:29,456 --> 00:40:32,755
Until then, he will be my
silent partner. Hal Hefner, sit down.

640
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:51,477
Do you know what I sounded
like the first speech I gave

641
00:40:51,511 --> 00:40:54,002
when I was your age?

642
00:40:54,047 --> 00:40:56,880
Ben told me I sounded like
a Bob Dole impersonator.

643
00:40:56,917 --> 00:40:58,885
I don't...

644
00:40:58,919 --> 00:41:00,750
I'm not even really...

645
00:41:00,787 --> 00:41:03,756
I'm not even quite sure
who that even is.

646
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,462
That was your first try,

647
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:13,898
your first of many.

648
00:41:13,934 --> 00:41:16,425
And I don't even think
anybody really noticed.

649
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,768
It really... it wasn't
that big a...

650
00:41:22,542 --> 00:41:24,533
So...

651
00:41:24,578 --> 00:41:27,741
we should get back. Well, I
should get back and finish the round...

652
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,838
Resolved that
the federal government

653
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:55,535
should support the teaching
of abstinence in public schools.

654
00:41:55,575 --> 00:41:57,600
Resolved!

655
00:41:57,644 --> 00:41:59,339
The motherf'ing federal government

656
00:41:59,379 --> 00:42:01,347
should support the teaching of
abstinence

657
00:42:01,381 --> 00:42:04,009
in motherf'ing,
fucking public schools!

658
00:42:09,923 --> 00:42:11,254
Resolved!

659
00:42:13,493 --> 00:42:16,519
Do you...
do you guys, um...

660
00:42:18,331 --> 00:42:20,822
do you know how, um...
how... how

661
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:23,267
you, or one,

662
00:42:23,303 --> 00:42:26,602
would take a relationship
to the next level?

663
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:29,641
I'm glad you came
to me, because...

664
00:42:29,676 --> 00:42:32,304
this is exactly the sort of
problem that Mommy and Daddy

665
00:42:32,345 --> 00:42:34,540
would royally screw up.

666
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:37,948
See, it's all about
having an agenda,

667
00:42:37,984 --> 00:42:41,283
which they will
never tell you.

668
00:42:41,321 --> 00:42:42,752
If you have a plan, like

669
00:42:42,753 --> 00:42:44,779
"Today, I'm getting a blowjob,"

670
00:42:44,824 --> 00:42:47,122
it helps you to
realize it.

671
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,219
It's all
very scientific.

672
00:42:49,262 --> 00:42:51,457
Mm-hm.
Yeah, I'm uh...

673
00:42:51,498 --> 00:42:53,898
I'm... I'm... I'm
just a doubter

674
00:42:53,934 --> 00:42:56,494
that giving me a... a BJ

675
00:42:56,536 --> 00:42:58,436
is high on Ginny's list.

676
00:43:01,308 --> 00:43:03,367
You're her partner,
right?

677
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:06,072
So you wait until
the moment is right.

678
00:43:08,548 --> 00:43:11,016
Like after you crack a good...
a really good joke,

679
00:43:11,051 --> 00:43:13,246
like the one that I crack
about the Queen of England,

680
00:43:13,286 --> 00:43:15,311
and then ask.

681
00:43:15,355 --> 00:43:16,860
It is totally worth the risk.

682
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:17,949
And you never know.

683
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:20,186
Once you've had a blowjob,
you'd understand.

684
00:43:20,226 --> 00:43:21,591
It's like...

685
00:43:21,628 --> 00:43:24,290
it's like walking
through a brick wall.

686
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:29,792
You know, Ginny said that
I won't be her...

687
00:43:29,836 --> 00:43:32,168
her, um, her real partner
for months.

688
00:43:32,205 --> 00:43:34,571
And that until then,
I'm like...

689
00:43:34,608 --> 00:43:37,509
the mascot.

690
00:43:37,544 --> 00:43:40,445
The disfluent mascot.

691
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,507
The disfluent mascot who's
not getting a BJ.

692
00:43:44,551 --> 00:43:46,348
Like the aardvark.

693
00:43:49,155 --> 00:43:52,318
No, that...
that was a joke, Heston.

694
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:56,989
There is no... there isn't
a debate mascot.

695
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:59,828
I, for some reason, was convinced
it was an aardvark.

696
00:44:01,635 --> 00:44:04,195
No.

697
00:44:05,238 --> 00:44:06,899
C'est la vie.

698
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:18,550
Hey, uh,
can I...

699
00:44:18,585 --> 00:44:21,110
I just...

700
00:44:24,424 --> 00:44:25,652
What?

701
00:44:25,692 --> 00:44:27,717
Oh, uh, I
just wanted...

702
00:44:27,761 --> 00:44:29,752
I wanted to try, uh,
this joke out on you.

703
00:44:29,796 --> 00:44:32,924
It's, well, uh... it's,
well, the delivery

704
00:44:32,966 --> 00:44:35,901
is kind of tricky, so...

705
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:41,932
What happens is that
the Queen of England

706
00:44:41,975 --> 00:44:44,170
goes onto this... this
television show, and...

707
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:46,872
Listen, I'm almost done
with this chapter.

708
00:44:46,913 --> 00:44:49,438
It's Thomas Aquinas.

709
00:44:49,482 --> 00:44:51,848
But if you continue telling
me that filthy joke,

710
00:44:51,885 --> 00:44:54,854
I'm gonna put this book down
and punch you very hard.

711
00:44:59,492 --> 00:45:02,893
You know, some... well,
someday you'll find love

712
00:45:02,929 --> 00:45:06,296
and then... then everything
will be different.

713
00:45:34,427 --> 00:45:36,019
Mas... mas...

714
00:45:36,062 --> 00:45:39,054
uh, masturbation is a natural precursor
of adult sexual development

715
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:41,465
and it should be unfettered
in a child's learning.

716
00:45:41,501 --> 00:45:43,264
Johnson, '98.

717
00:45:43,303 --> 00:45:44,634
Her plans changed.

718
00:45:44,671 --> 00:45:46,730
Virginia says to keep
on working hard

719
00:45:46,773 --> 00:45:49,742
and she'll call you to let you know
when you should come on over.

720
00:45:49,776 --> 00:45:52,506
Well, because the Hazlet
tournament is almost here, and...

721
00:45:52,545 --> 00:45:55,480
Just keep on keeping on
and maybe she'll call you.

722
00:46:05,725 --> 00:46:07,022
Hi, there.

723
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,824
Do you know... do you know
if Ginny Ryerson is okay?

724
00:46:09,863 --> 00:46:11,694
Because she
canceled our time today

725
00:46:11,731 --> 00:46:14,097
and we have a... we have
a big tournament coming up,

726
00:46:14,134 --> 00:46:17,592
at Hazlet High School, and all
the major Jersey schools will be there.

727
00:46:17,637 --> 00:46:21,869
And I... and, uh, she hasn't...
she hasn't really, uh,

728
00:46:21,908 --> 00:46:24,706
told me what her strategy
is gonna be to help me

729
00:46:24,744 --> 00:46:26,712
deal with my...
with my speech.

730
00:46:26,746 --> 00:46:29,374
She got into a Lincoln
with that Indian guy.

731
00:46:41,694 --> 00:46:44,185
- And you're back.
- Is Ginny all right?

732
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:46,289
Because Lewis Garrles
from across the street

733
00:46:46,332 --> 00:46:48,459
said she got into a
Lincoln with an Indian man.

734
00:46:48,501 --> 00:46:49,866
A boy, that's right.

735
00:46:49,903 --> 00:46:52,736
- So, she... but she's fine?
- Fine.

736
00:46:52,772 --> 00:46:54,433
You, could...
will you just tell her

737
00:46:54,474 --> 00:46:58,205
that... that I'm done and over
with the masturbation defense?

738
00:46:58,244 --> 00:47:00,212
Tell her that, will you?
Just assure her

739
00:47:00,246 --> 00:47:02,180
that I'm... that I'm...
that I'm...

740
00:47:02,215 --> 00:47:05,184
that I'm done with masturbation
and I'm ready to show her.

741
00:47:05,218 --> 00:47:07,186
You take care now.

742
00:47:12,258 --> 00:47:15,523
I told Judge Pete about all
the fun you've been having

743
00:47:15,562 --> 00:47:17,553
with debate,
and guess the news?

744
00:47:17,597 --> 00:47:19,155
Heston's a joiner.

745
00:47:22,802 --> 00:47:25,032
Uh, yeah, um...

746
00:47:25,071 --> 00:47:27,301
it's... it's too late,
Heston.

747
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:29,467
The, um...

748
00:47:29,509 --> 00:47:32,069
the teams have
all been settled.

749
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:34,671
Coach Lumbly said that after
the first tournament

750
00:47:34,714 --> 00:47:37,444
someone always gets creamed
and never comes back.

751
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:39,644
So, I'll be
filling that slot,

752
00:47:39,686 --> 00:47:41,779
whomevers that may be.

753
00:47:41,821 --> 00:47:44,881
To discover opportunity

754
00:47:44,924 --> 00:47:47,290
in misery:

755
00:47:47,327 --> 00:47:49,352
There's sense
in that.

756
00:47:49,395 --> 00:47:51,522
That's how
I found you, my love.

757
00:48:01,274 --> 00:48:03,868
Hello?
Connie Ryerson speaking.

758
00:48:05,879 --> 00:48:08,905
Uh...

759
00:48:08,948 --> 00:48:11,416
Virgil?
Is that you?

760
00:48:11,451 --> 00:48:13,043
Uh!

761
00:48:13,086 --> 00:48:15,179
Uh...

762
00:48:15,221 --> 00:48:17,155
Uh, uh...

763
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:19,988
uh, this is, uh...
this, uh...

764
00:48:20,026 --> 00:48:23,086
this is, uh...
this is...

765
00:48:23,129 --> 00:48:26,496
Hal Hefner for, um...
for...

766
00:48:26,532 --> 00:48:29,763
call... I'm...
I'm calling for, uh...

767
00:48:29,802 --> 00:48:32,362
G- I-N-N-Y...
Ginny.

768
00:48:32,405 --> 00:48:34,396
Hold the line.

769
00:48:36,743 --> 00:48:39,610
Hi, Ginny. It's Hal.

770
00:48:39,646 --> 00:48:42,080
Hey, Hef here.
What's up?

771
00:48:42,115 --> 00:48:43,844
Hal?

772
00:48:43,883 --> 00:48:46,977
Uh, yeah...
yeah?

773
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,478
She says she'll see you at
the debate tomorrow. Okay?

774
00:48:50,523 --> 00:48:51,888
Okay, well,
we...

775
00:48:51,925 --> 00:48:54,052
we... um, I really...
I really...

776
00:48:54,093 --> 00:48:56,994
we... I really...
we need to, uh...

777
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:58,258
practice with her.

778
00:48:58,298 --> 00:49:00,129
She'll see you then.

779
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:03,192
Hello?

780
00:49:03,236 --> 00:49:04,370
Good morning, Judge.

781
00:49:04,371 --> 00:49:06,637
Good morning, our esteemed opponents.

782
00:49:06,673 --> 00:49:09,005
N... let's...

783
00:49:09,042 --> 00:49:11,533
Let's begin with our plan.

784
00:49:13,346 --> 00:49:16,440
That the federal
government should...

785
00:49:16,482 --> 00:49:17,972
Shut the mumbling, Susie.

786
00:49:18,017 --> 00:49:20,451
But do not stop working,
because if you fail tomorrow,

787
00:49:20,486 --> 00:49:23,785
the whole Hefner family fails
too, and I am not a failure.

788
00:49:23,823 --> 00:49:25,984
So do not do it!

789
00:49:26,025 --> 00:49:27,993
Uh...

790
00:49:29,028 --> 00:49:30,518
good morning there,
Judge...

791
00:49:30,563 --> 00:49:33,031
good morning,
our esteemed opponents.

792
00:49:55,254 --> 00:49:57,654
When you work
so hard at something,

793
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:00,352
so hard,
all that extra time...

794
00:50:00,393 --> 00:50:02,365
Wallace, you always tell me balance out,

795
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:03,794
balance out, balance out...

796
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:06,560
What are you
talking about?

797
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:09,193
Ginny Ryerson has transferred
to Townsend Prep

798
00:50:09,235 --> 00:50:10,862
for the rest
of her senior year.

799
00:50:13,172 --> 00:50:14,636
We have an even number so, Hal,

800
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:16,573
you'll muddle through today with Heston

801
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:19,476
and we'll reconstitute
the teams tomorrow.

802
00:50:20,613 --> 00:50:22,478
Let's go, Wallace.

803
00:50:46,706 --> 00:50:49,971
Would you like to tell me
what our Affirmative case is?

804
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:52,603
Or would you rather
it be a surprise?

805
00:51:53,706 --> 00:51:56,698
Uh...

806
00:51:56,742 --> 00:52:00,007
good... good...
good morning there, Judge.

807
00:52:00,046 --> 00:52:02,879
Good, uh... good...
good...

808
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:05,440
good morning to you,
uh...

809
00:52:05,485 --> 00:52:08,420
both, you, our
esteemed opponents.

810
00:52:08,454 --> 00:52:10,547
Good morning, uh...

811
00:52:20,366 --> 00:52:22,630
The...

812
00:52:22,668 --> 00:52:25,000
ab... ab...

813
00:52:29,142 --> 00:52:30,541
That, uh...

814
00:52:30,576 --> 00:52:32,567
resolved that... that...

815
00:52:32,612 --> 00:52:35,410
that... that... that...
that, uh...

816
00:52:35,448 --> 00:52:38,383
that it, uh...

817
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:41,386
How much time, timer?

818
00:52:48,494 --> 00:52:49,825
Yeah, hello?

819
00:52:49,862 --> 00:52:53,662
Mr... Mr... uh...
um, Mr...

820
00:52:53,699 --> 00:52:56,327
Hal?
What's the matter?

821
00:52:56,369 --> 00:52:58,599
It's... it's, uh...
it's, uh,

822
00:52:58,638 --> 00:53:01,402
well, it's funny
that you ask, actually.

823
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,376
Um, I've... I'm just...
I'm just here at, um...

824
00:53:05,411 --> 00:53:08,471
I'm at... I'm at...
I'm at Hazlet...

825
00:53:08,514 --> 00:53:10,573
Hazlet High School,
at the debate.

826
00:53:10,616 --> 00:53:14,143
And spent the last...
I've...

827
00:53:14,187 --> 00:53:16,849
I spent the last seven minutes
of my round-one speech

828
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:19,050
trying... trying to
say the resolution.

829
00:53:19,091 --> 00:53:21,218
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

830
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,622
Well, there's that video I gave you,

831
00:53:23,623 --> 00:53:25,788
"Singing Instead of Talking. "

832
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:30,427
Yeah, did, uh... did rat poison
and a straw come with that video?

833
00:53:30,469 --> 00:53:33,370
Well, my ex-girlfriend,
the PhD at Annenberg,

834
00:53:33,406 --> 00:53:37,206
she used to say her brother never
stuttered if he spoke in an accent.

835
00:53:37,243 --> 00:53:39,871
You could try the accent
you know best,

836
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:42,346
and maybe that
would help.

837
00:53:42,381 --> 00:53:44,178
Well, anyway, I
wouldn't count on it.

838
00:53:44,217 --> 00:53:46,947
Mina's advice was about
as far-fetched as she was.

839
00:53:46,986 --> 00:53:49,648
You know, open
relationships just...

840
00:53:49,689 --> 00:53:51,281
don't work, Hal.

841
00:53:51,324 --> 00:53:53,519
What?

842
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:55,083
Uh, I'm advising...

843
00:53:55,127 --> 00:53:58,688
that you should
try to do an accent.

844
00:53:58,731 --> 00:54:00,722
- Okay?
- If I do that

845
00:54:00,766 --> 00:54:03,462
you won't see...
you won't see me on Monday.

846
00:54:03,502 --> 00:54:06,801
'Cause I'll already be...
I'll be on a...

847
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:09,307
I'll probably be
on a plane to...

848
00:54:10,543 --> 00:54:12,135
Can you hold on
for a sec?

849
00:54:22,288 --> 00:54:24,051
Okay, I should...

850
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:26,422
I should, mayb...
maybe I should...

851
00:54:26,459 --> 00:54:27,858
I should probably go.

852
00:54:49,815 --> 00:54:51,749
Good afternoon,

853
00:54:51,784 --> 00:54:54,344
esteemed opponents
from Glen Rock.

854
00:54:54,387 --> 00:54:59,324
Good afternoon.
Let's get our... let...

855
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:01,849
let's, uh...
let... let...

856
00:55:01,894 --> 00:55:05,455
let's get, uh, down and...
down and... down and dirty,

857
00:55:05,498 --> 00:55:07,830
shall we, with this...
this thing...

858
00:55:07,867 --> 00:55:11,496
this thing... this thing...
this thing I'll call our plan.

859
00:55:18,711 --> 00:55:20,042
Excuse me, I'm...

860
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,706
I'm... I'm...

861
00:55:21,747 --> 00:55:24,841
I'm...
I'm really sorry.

862
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,249
Slice of pizza or
Sloppy Joes,

863
00:55:29,288 --> 00:55:30,687
and I don't want
to debate about it.

864
00:55:30,723 --> 00:55:32,190
I'll take the pizza.

865
00:55:36,329 --> 00:55:39,389
Townsend Prep's just a really,
really good school.

866
00:55:41,233 --> 00:55:43,201
Slice of pizza
or Sloppy Joes

867
00:55:43,235 --> 00:55:45,032
and I don't want to
debate you on it.

868
00:55:45,071 --> 00:55:46,504
Pizza, two slices.

869
00:55:48,274 --> 00:55:49,717
Slice of pizza, Sloppy Joes,

870
00:55:49,718 --> 00:55:51,675
and I don't want to debate about it.

871
00:55:51,711 --> 00:55:53,542
Um...

872
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:55,877
I'll...
I'll have the...

873
00:55:55,915 --> 00:55:58,713
not the... the, um...

874
00:55:58,751 --> 00:56:00,116
- the, um...
- We're out of pizza.

875
00:56:00,152 --> 00:56:02,382
Sloppy Joes are
all that's left.

876
00:56:02,421 --> 00:56:05,913
But they're not that terrible if you've
never had really good ones before.

877
00:56:07,393 --> 00:56:08,917
Thank you, ma'am.

878
00:56:25,444 --> 00:56:28,004
She's not here.

879
00:56:28,047 --> 00:56:29,981
Ginny and I don't
eat at tournaments...

880
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:31,983
draws blood
from the brain.

881
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:43,756
...will cause
special love in adulthood.

882
00:57:21,934 --> 00:57:24,198
I just...
I don't...

883
00:57:24,236 --> 00:57:27,399
I don't really know
what to do here.

884
00:57:28,707 --> 00:57:31,676
Well, um,
this is the girls' room.

885
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,177
So...

886
00:57:33,212 --> 00:57:35,271
Okay.

887
00:57:40,386 --> 00:57:44,083
I want to read, also,
what one judge wrote

888
00:57:44,123 --> 00:57:46,819
about Virginia.
She wrote:

889
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:50,989
"Virginia may be
the next Barbara Jordan. "

890
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:52,998
How about that?

891
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:56,862
First place,
Individual Speaker...

892
00:57:56,902 --> 00:57:59,200
Virginia Ryerson.

893
00:58:09,315 --> 00:58:12,045
Where's the trophy?

894
00:58:17,857 --> 00:58:20,348
Thank you.

895
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:31,502
Hal Hefner,
stay a moment, would you?

896
00:58:41,247 --> 00:58:43,511
I'm gonna regroup.

897
00:58:43,549 --> 00:58:45,983
Um, let's be
adults here

898
00:58:46,018 --> 00:58:48,543
and think about who
could use...

899
00:58:48,587 --> 00:58:51,647
a little time
on the sidelines.

900
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,215
Ginny recruited me.

901
00:58:56,562 --> 00:58:59,895
Okay?
She intuited...

902
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,300
intuited that I...
that I...

903
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:06,736
that my... that my brain
was made for this.

904
00:59:06,772 --> 00:59:07,995
I mean, you can't even...

905
00:59:07,996 --> 00:59:09,707
you can't even ask me a question

906
00:59:09,742 --> 00:59:13,269
without my brain
filling up with retorts.

907
00:59:13,312 --> 00:59:15,803
It's... it's full
of retorts.

908
00:59:15,848 --> 00:59:18,112
Do you know
Mento Buin,

909
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,812
who doesn't speak more
than six words of English?

910
00:59:22,087 --> 00:59:24,453
Or Evie Spedarsky,

911
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,856
who has such pronounced
Irritable Bowel Syndrome

912
00:59:26,892 --> 00:59:29,156
that she's being studied
by a team at Princeton?

913
00:59:29,194 --> 00:59:30,559
No.

914
00:59:30,596 --> 00:59:32,223
What about
Elvis Hunsinger,

915
00:59:32,264 --> 00:59:34,459
the boy who pees
himself in gym class?

916
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,798
Well, everybody knows...

917
00:59:36,835 --> 00:59:38,462
Elvis.

918
00:59:38,504 --> 00:59:40,836
She tried to
recruit them all.

919
00:59:40,873 --> 00:59:45,207
Never crossed my mind that this
could be some scheme of hers,

920
00:59:45,244 --> 00:59:47,576
but, when you
think about it

921
00:59:47,613 --> 00:59:50,343
looks pretty pat.

922
01:00:15,741 --> 01:00:18,266
Your mom's running late
but wants us to...

923
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:20,210
Hey, now.

924
01:00:21,847 --> 01:00:23,974
Wait a minute.
Let me see.

925
01:00:25,484 --> 01:00:27,384
Oh, Jesus!

926
01:00:27,419 --> 01:00:29,614
Man, oh man!

927
01:00:29,655 --> 01:00:32,556
The most Heston ever hauled in
was an honorable mention

928
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:34,559
in the Hip-hop
Danceathon.

929
01:00:34,593 --> 01:00:37,221
But this is too much
coming from you!

930
01:00:37,262 --> 01:00:39,594
On behalf of your dad...

931
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:50,200
This goes on the dining room table
for your mom to see when she gets home.

932
01:00:50,242 --> 01:00:53,336
Whoo!

933
01:01:29,581 --> 01:01:32,311
My dad told me I was
the world's utmost idiot

934
01:01:32,351 --> 01:01:35,013
for not realizing
you won something today.

935
01:01:35,054 --> 01:01:38,182
Please accept my
belated congratulations.

936
01:01:51,336 --> 01:01:53,964
- Hello?
- Hello, Sylvia.

937
01:01:54,006 --> 01:01:57,874
Fern didn't say anything
about Lewis's friends stopping by!

938
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:00,208
I get paid
per kid!

939
01:02:32,878 --> 01:02:36,177
She can't be
going to bed.

940
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:05,275
Resolved!

941
01:03:29,234 --> 01:03:32,294
Sylvia, no tip
for you tonight.

942
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,509
Fuck!

943
01:03:59,064 --> 01:04:01,828
There's a cello
in your house now.

944
01:04:51,116 --> 01:04:53,414
I hate you!

945
01:04:53,452 --> 01:04:55,943
Mommy and
Judge Pete hate you!

946
01:04:55,988 --> 01:04:57,956
Daddy hates you!

947
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:01,619
Melody, Daddy's new
girlfriend, hates you.

948
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,128
That bottle was reposado,
you doofus dunce!

949
01:05:05,297 --> 01:05:07,765
Uncle Chaz spent
big bucks on that.

950
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:09,824
Uncle Chaz hates you!

951
01:05:17,609 --> 01:05:19,839
That's all I wanted
to say.

952
01:05:21,346 --> 01:05:23,337
There's pineapple cake
in the fridge.

953
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:28,110
If you're late I'll eat the whole cake,
so don't be late.

954
01:05:50,175 --> 01:05:54,874
Maybe you should put the
whole debate thing behind you,

955
01:05:54,913 --> 01:05:58,212
all a...
a lark of adolescence.

956
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,115
We all have 'em.

957
01:06:00,152 --> 01:06:03,986
Mine was cheerleading.

958
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:08,054
I was the one boy
on the cheerleading squad.

959
01:06:08,093 --> 01:06:10,391
Imagine that, huh?

960
01:06:10,429 --> 01:06:13,057
Give me a "H," uh-uh-uh.
Give me a "A,"

961
01:06:13,098 --> 01:06:15,828
uh-uh-uh.
Give me a "L," uh-uh-uh.

962
01:06:15,867 --> 01:06:18,802
What does that spell?
Hal.

963
01:06:18,837 --> 01:06:22,466
That... that image is...

964
01:06:22,507 --> 01:06:24,441
is not really helping.

965
01:06:24,476 --> 01:06:28,071
Just... just because
debate was a wipeout,

966
01:06:28,113 --> 01:06:31,082
I mean, you know,
a colossal wipeout,

967
01:06:31,116 --> 01:06:33,584
doesn't mean
that you're a failure.

968
01:06:33,618 --> 01:06:36,917
It's the activity
that failed you.

969
01:06:36,955 --> 01:06:40,322
Hey, there's nothing to say you
couldn't try for the Spanish Club.

970
01:06:40,359 --> 01:06:43,328
You could be Spanish Club
Vice President in no time.

971
01:06:43,362 --> 01:06:46,229
Kyle Felowitz
is El Vice Presidente.

972
01:06:47,232 --> 01:06:48,529
Yeah.

973
01:06:48,567 --> 01:06:50,694
My point, Hal,
is that

974
01:06:50,736 --> 01:06:53,000
you have to get out
of your own way here, man,

975
01:06:53,038 --> 01:06:56,064
go back to living the way
you were before you tried to exceed

976
01:06:56,108 --> 01:06:59,202
your... your limitations.

977
01:07:06,251 --> 01:07:08,685
Hal Hefner floated
above his life,

978
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,247
saw the world around him
as if he were just a ghost

979
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:13,814
floating through.

980
01:07:13,859 --> 01:07:15,850
Nothing could
harm him now.

981
01:07:15,894 --> 01:07:19,022
Nothing could move him
or make him love again.

982
01:07:20,065 --> 01:07:21,589
He was that kind
of ghost.

983
01:07:21,633 --> 01:07:24,568
The kind that
couldn't love again.

984
01:07:28,206 --> 01:07:31,004
...observation 1-A.

985
01:07:31,043 --> 01:07:33,568
Diversion is the norm.

986
01:07:35,981 --> 01:07:38,245
Quoting from the
"Journal of Adult Sexuality" '74:

987
01:07:38,283 --> 01:07:41,047
The root cause of sexual
dysfunction are many...

988
01:07:42,554 --> 01:07:44,078
As a boy ghost,

989
01:07:44,122 --> 01:07:46,920
Hal Hefner surveyed
the world as he knew it.

990
01:07:46,958 --> 01:07:50,553
And in everything he saw
was evidence that life goes on

991
01:07:50,595 --> 01:07:53,063
with or without love.

992
01:07:53,098 --> 01:07:56,397
He had stopped
thinking about the girl,

993
01:07:56,435 --> 01:07:59,199
had stopped
dreaming about her,

994
01:07:59,237 --> 01:08:01,762
or, even if that wasn't
entirely true,

995
01:08:01,807 --> 01:08:05,208
had stopped dreaming
a certain kind of dream about her.

996
01:08:05,243 --> 01:08:09,111
Well, maybe
most of the time.

997
01:08:12,017 --> 01:08:13,678
Then spring came...

998
01:08:13,718 --> 01:08:16,016
11 months after
his father left;

999
01:08:16,054 --> 01:08:19,148
six months since
he last saw Ginny;

1000
01:08:19,191 --> 01:08:21,557
and six since
they'd kissed.

1001
01:08:43,515 --> 01:08:45,540
Over and over again!

1002
01:08:45,584 --> 01:08:47,711
- Just stop!
- I just want us to be buddies.

1003
01:08:47,752 --> 01:08:50,812
Be buddies with yourself!

1004
01:08:52,457 --> 01:08:54,220
Boys...

1005
01:08:54,259 --> 01:08:55,329
your mom and I are over.

1006
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:56,489
That's according to her.

1007
01:08:56,528 --> 01:09:00,055
She said that it was all her,
that it's always all her

1008
01:09:00,098 --> 01:09:02,999
- and could we be buddies?
- This is a very complicated

1009
01:09:03,034 --> 01:09:05,229
adult relationship.

1010
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:07,067
This is why
your dad left.

1011
01:09:07,105 --> 01:09:09,573
You're just so
messed up!

1012
01:09:29,027 --> 01:09:30,585
Shit!

1013
01:09:31,863 --> 01:09:34,354
Good God!

1014
01:09:56,721 --> 01:09:59,588
Mommy! Mommy!
Hal's freaking out in the garage!

1015
01:09:59,624 --> 01:10:01,615
This is gonna turn out
bad, I can feel it.

1016
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:04,629
Virginia Ryerson, please
come to the main office.

1017
01:10:04,663 --> 01:10:08,224
Virginia Ryerson, you have
a visitor in the main office.

1018
01:10:14,506 --> 01:10:16,303
Are you her
little brother?

1019
01:10:16,341 --> 01:10:18,809
You look like you could
be her little brother.

1020
01:10:20,045 --> 01:10:22,980
I'm... I'm her ex-lover.

1021
01:10:23,014 --> 01:10:25,915
Take a seat. She'll be with you
in a minute.

1022
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,390
So how far did you
get with her?

1023
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:44,600
Does... does it count
as second base

1024
01:10:44,636 --> 01:10:46,604
when it's groping
through the shirt?

1025
01:10:47,872 --> 01:10:50,500
Maybe in public school.

1026
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:53,670
What are you doing here?

1027
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:56,340
Oh, uh, uh...

1028
01:10:56,381 --> 01:10:58,076
I...

1029
01:10:58,116 --> 01:11:01,711
I have, uh... it's
spring break at Plainsboro.

1030
01:11:01,753 --> 01:11:04,415
I have...
I have the... the day off.

1031
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:07,681
Okay.

1032
01:11:09,794 --> 01:11:12,160
I'm going back to
A.P. Latin now.

1033
01:11:12,197 --> 01:11:15,030
Wait... I'm... I'm
returning this to you.

1034
01:11:16,201 --> 01:11:19,398
It belongs
to you and...

1035
01:11:19,437 --> 01:11:22,235
and it's important
to me that you have it.

1036
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:26,275
It's your Hazlet trophy.

1037
01:11:29,814 --> 01:11:33,181
I had a bad night,
but I'm better now.

1038
01:11:33,218 --> 01:11:35,277
I don't want the trophy.

1039
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,853
I'm... I'm gonna go back to class.

1040
01:11:36,854 --> 01:11:37,754
You need to leave.

1041
01:11:37,789 --> 01:11:39,780
Wait... every...
every... every...

1042
01:11:39,824 --> 01:11:41,655
everybody has
their own path!

1043
01:11:41,693 --> 01:11:44,958
And, uh...

1044
01:11:48,033 --> 01:11:50,900
Security, please report
to the main office.

1045
01:11:50,935 --> 01:11:52,664
Need you to deal with a...

1046
01:11:52,704 --> 01:11:55,571
stuttering boy
in the main office.

1047
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:58,303
It was like he was
pretending,

1048
01:11:58,343 --> 01:12:01,107
pretending that it could
all be what it was.

1049
01:12:01,146 --> 01:12:02,773
But it can't.

1050
01:12:02,814 --> 01:12:05,442
You can only pretend for so
long before the forces that be

1051
01:12:05,483 --> 01:12:07,474
take that away from you.

1052
01:12:11,423 --> 01:12:13,550
Just like that,
it took off

1053
01:12:13,591 --> 01:12:15,422
and he found
himself sprinting.

1054
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:17,894
It was ridiculous,
but he did... he sprinted.

1055
01:12:24,235 --> 01:12:28,501
You don't let love collapse all around
you and not put up a fight.

1056
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:30,303
You punch back,

1057
01:12:30,342 --> 01:12:34,142
unless you can find someone
else to throw the punch for you.

1058
01:12:34,179 --> 01:12:36,613
Then, by all means,
do that.

1059
01:12:40,251 --> 01:12:41,718
Yeah?

1060
01:12:43,688 --> 01:12:46,953
Uh, I'm... I'm here from
Plainsboro High,

1061
01:12:46,991 --> 01:12:50,893
and I've... I've, uh...
I've come here to find you.

1062
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:53,522
Wait in the front
if you care to.

1063
01:12:53,565 --> 01:12:55,499
My shift ends
on the hour.

1064
01:12:55,533 --> 01:12:56,830
Oh, I care to.

1065
01:12:56,868 --> 01:12:59,234
Yeah, well, that's fine.
Wait in front.

1066
01:13:08,413 --> 01:13:11,007
That's God
doing your dry-cleaning.

1067
01:13:13,351 --> 01:13:16,343
God does dry-cleaning.

1068
01:13:16,388 --> 01:13:19,619
He wears a smock.

1069
01:13:29,401 --> 01:13:32,928
Man, it's a blessing to
be squarely and dearly

1070
01:13:32,971 --> 01:13:36,372
out of the
goddamn suburbs.

1071
01:13:36,408 --> 01:13:39,206
Suck the marrow right
from you, the suburbs will.

1072
01:13:39,244 --> 01:13:41,007
And it takes years

1073
01:13:41,045 --> 01:13:44,481
in the big city to inject
the life back into you...

1074
01:13:44,516 --> 01:13:46,211
literal years.

1075
01:13:46,251 --> 01:13:49,379
You... you mean,
the big city is...

1076
01:13:50,688 --> 01:13:52,315
is... is Trenton?

1077
01:13:52,357 --> 01:13:55,121
That's right...
Trenton.

1078
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,128
Oh.

1079
01:13:57,162 --> 01:13:59,221
Did Ginny send you?

1080
01:13:59,264 --> 01:14:02,256
Oh no, she doesn't... she doesn't...
she doesn't know anything.

1081
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,768
- Lumbly?
- No, no. No.

1082
01:14:04,803 --> 01:14:07,966
Because if this is part of a grand
design to get me back to school...

1083
01:14:09,774 --> 01:14:11,765
You smell that
bus exhaust?

1084
01:14:13,144 --> 01:14:14,907
That'll be what you
leave behind

1085
01:14:14,946 --> 01:14:17,779
on your way back to
Plainsboro without me.

1086
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:21,347
Wait. The thing is,
is that, uh...

1087
01:14:21,386 --> 01:14:24,787
what I want... what I want...
what I need is your help.

1088
01:14:24,823 --> 01:14:26,518
You don't even know me.

1089
01:14:27,559 --> 01:14:30,585
You... you do realize
you're like...

1090
01:14:30,628 --> 01:14:33,256
you're like a legend
at PHS, right?

1091
01:14:33,298 --> 01:14:35,596
Right, I'm the next
Shelley Hasty.

1092
01:14:35,633 --> 01:14:37,897
Who is...
who's she?

1093
01:14:37,936 --> 01:14:41,030
He. He supposedly drove
a Chevy Nova

1094
01:14:41,072 --> 01:14:43,597
into the cafeteria
in 1986.

1095
01:14:43,641 --> 01:14:47,133
There's a plaque somewhere next to
a water fountain in his honor.

1096
01:14:48,213 --> 01:14:49,510
Well...

1097
01:14:49,547 --> 01:14:52,539
I'm... I'm gonna be
the next legend at PHS.

1098
01:14:54,352 --> 01:14:57,287
And that's... that's not gonna
happen for me any other way

1099
01:14:57,322 --> 01:15:01,053
than to win...
uh, to win at States.

1100
01:15:03,828 --> 01:15:05,728
You're gonna
win at States?

1101
01:15:05,763 --> 01:15:07,697
Yes.

1102
01:15:07,732 --> 01:15:09,666
Well... well... well,
uh...

1103
01:15:09,701 --> 01:15:11,862
we are, yes.

1104
01:15:13,938 --> 01:15:15,667
It's so pointless.

1105
01:15:15,707 --> 01:15:19,609
That's the realization
I came to at States last year:

1106
01:15:19,644 --> 01:15:22,442
Life is nothing
but repetition,

1107
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,141
the same thing
over and over.

1108
01:15:24,182 --> 01:15:25,774
Somebody might
give you a trophy

1109
01:15:25,817 --> 01:15:27,682
and that's supposed to
mean you're making progress,

1110
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:30,187
but there's no such thing.
The fights you fight today

1111
01:15:30,221 --> 01:15:32,485
are the fights you
fight till you die.

1112
01:15:32,524 --> 01:15:34,924
Yeah, well be...
be that as it may...

1113
01:15:34,959 --> 01:15:36,426
Sure.

1114
01:15:36,461 --> 01:15:38,361
Be that as it may.

1115
01:15:38,396 --> 01:15:41,854
Wait, it's not some
college-application bullshit

1116
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,477
that is... that's like the driving

1117
01:15:43,478 --> 01:15:44,869
force here, or any bullshit.

1118
01:15:44,903 --> 01:15:46,894
I'm sure.

1119
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:04,682
No, uh, do you want
to know what it is?

1120
01:16:04,722 --> 01:16:08,180
Yeah. What
it is, is...

1121
01:16:08,226 --> 01:16:11,024
what it...
what it is, is...

1122
01:16:11,062 --> 01:16:13,257
uh, it's, uh...

1123
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:16,424
is, uh, is...

1124
01:16:16,467 --> 01:16:19,561
no, what... what it
is, is...

1125
01:16:19,604 --> 01:16:21,902
it's...
well, it's love.

1126
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:24,408
Well, if it's
not that, then...

1127
01:16:24,442 --> 01:16:27,240
then it's the need
for... for revenge

1128
01:16:27,278 --> 01:16:29,712
when... when love
goes bad.

1129
01:16:29,747 --> 01:16:31,977
It's one of those two,
love or revenge.

1130
01:16:32,016 --> 01:16:33,574
I'm not really sure
which one.

1131
01:16:33,618 --> 01:16:35,313
But it's one of
those two things

1132
01:16:35,353 --> 01:16:37,218
that made me throw a cello
through somebody's window.

1133
01:16:37,255 --> 01:16:38,244
So you figure it out.

1134
01:16:38,289 --> 01:16:40,018
An actual cello?

1135
01:16:41,426 --> 01:16:45,021
I mean, like, yeah, like
symphony-size, as far as I know.

1136
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:49,529
You know, that's pretty
sharp in my book,

1137
01:16:49,567 --> 01:16:51,728
as far as reasons go.

1138
01:16:51,769 --> 01:16:54,533
Yeah, it took
a bunch of throws,

1139
01:16:54,572 --> 01:16:58,372
but you know,
I'm good for a bunch.

1140
01:16:58,409 --> 01:16:59,876
Have I got this right?

1141
01:16:59,911 --> 01:17:02,175
Your contention is that
we should debate as a team?

1142
01:17:02,213 --> 01:17:05,205
You, an inexperienced kid with
a bad and unpredictable stutter,

1143
01:17:05,249 --> 01:17:06,739
me, not having debated
at all this year

1144
01:17:06,784 --> 01:17:08,479
and having no knowledge
of the resolution.

1145
01:17:08,519 --> 01:17:10,817
In support of this,
you basically offer up

1146
01:17:10,855 --> 01:17:13,415
that you threw a cello
through someone's window.

1147
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:15,551
It's charming,
no question.

1148
01:17:15,593 --> 01:17:17,288
But is it persuasive?

1149
01:17:17,328 --> 01:17:19,853
Why not make the case

1150
01:17:19,897 --> 01:17:22,058
that, A: Allowing me to return
to States and win this year

1151
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:23,965
will tie up that loose end
so that I can forge ahead

1152
01:17:24,002 --> 01:17:25,469
free from any of
life's regrets;

1153
01:17:25,503 --> 01:17:27,198
That charitable
enterprises such as this

1154
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:28,796
would be the lifeblood
of advanced civilizations

1155
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,502
even, perhaps especially in places
like Trenton, New Jersey;

1156
01:17:31,542 --> 01:17:33,669
And C: That while this life
here is infinitely preferable

1157
01:17:33,711 --> 01:17:35,406
to the wretchedness
of the suburbs,

1158
01:17:35,446 --> 01:17:38,040
it's also not quite what
I must have had in mind

1159
01:17:38,082 --> 01:17:42,018
and maybe I miss some of
the mundane thrills of policy debate.

1160
01:17:42,053 --> 01:17:45,386
Yeah, I mean,
all of that.

1161
01:17:50,962 --> 01:17:53,522
This goes against
my better judgment.

1162
01:17:53,564 --> 01:17:56,431
It does. But what we'll
need is one Affirmative case

1163
01:17:56,467 --> 01:17:58,594
and one all-purpose
Negative counterplan.

1164
01:17:58,636 --> 01:18:00,399
We can't do a year's worth
of work in one month,

1165
01:18:00,438 --> 01:18:02,235
so we'll concentrate on
those two lines of attack.

1166
01:18:02,273 --> 01:18:04,332
You'll have to arrange
with your parents...

1167
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:06,366
do you have parents?

1168
01:18:06,411 --> 01:18:08,242
Oh, yeah,
I have a...

1169
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:11,112
a mom that I see
most days and...

1170
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:13,049
and I see my dad
some weekends.

1171
01:18:13,084 --> 01:18:15,177
You'll have to come to some
arrangement with them

1172
01:18:15,219 --> 01:18:16,243
or else let go of trying to

1173
01:18:16,287 --> 01:18:18,221
so that you can spend
evenings and weekends here.

1174
01:18:18,256 --> 01:18:20,087
We'll register as
a home-schooled team.

1175
01:18:20,124 --> 01:18:21,092
My grandmother will sign

1176
01:18:21,093 --> 01:18:22,786
whatever official paperwork is required.

1177
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:24,920
But all such considerations
wait on our priority,

1178
01:18:24,962 --> 01:18:26,759
and that's finding
you your voice.

1179
01:18:37,141 --> 01:18:40,042
Suddenly, Trenton was
a different city;

1180
01:18:40,078 --> 01:18:42,239
no longer a dead end
but a starting place.

1181
01:18:43,715 --> 01:18:45,273
Trenton:

1182
01:18:45,316 --> 01:18:47,307
The very city
of triumph.

1183
01:18:51,355 --> 01:18:55,314
Fire when ready!

1184
01:18:55,359 --> 01:18:57,793
This isn't... this isn't

1185
01:18:57,829 --> 01:18:59,694
very good for
one's spirit.

1186
01:18:59,731 --> 01:19:01,562
I can't hear you!

1187
01:19:01,599 --> 01:19:04,591
It's... it's
spirit-crushing, I said.

1188
01:19:05,636 --> 01:19:07,433
Fine.

1189
01:19:08,706 --> 01:19:10,731
What should I say?

1190
01:19:10,775 --> 01:19:13,608
Give me your standard
Affirmative opening.

1191
01:19:13,644 --> 01:19:15,737
Yeah.

1192
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:19,216
You know, I haven't really said it
enough for it to really be...

1193
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:20,979
for it to be standard.

1194
01:19:21,018 --> 01:19:24,010
Throw me the cello!

1195
01:19:24,055 --> 01:19:26,148
Uh...

1196
01:19:30,561 --> 01:19:31,621
Let's get down and dirty.

1197
01:19:31,622 --> 01:19:32,426
Let's get down...

1198
01:19:34,766 --> 01:19:35,926
Let's... let's get...

1199
01:19:35,967 --> 01:19:37,457
let's get, uh...

1200
01:19:37,502 --> 01:19:39,663
let's get...
let us... let us...

1201
01:19:39,704 --> 01:19:43,196
uh, okay, let's just...
let... let us...

1202
01:19:46,577 --> 01:19:48,272
It's a riddle.

1203
01:19:48,312 --> 01:19:49,802
Yeah, yeah.

1204
01:19:49,847 --> 01:19:51,781
What it is is one of
those rare instances

1205
01:19:51,816 --> 01:19:55,445
where one of us having an advanced
college-degree might actually help.

1206
01:19:57,288 --> 01:19:59,313
I won't whisper.

1207
01:19:59,357 --> 01:20:01,689
It's a trick,
but it's... it's, uh...

1208
01:20:01,726 --> 01:20:04,786
it's crap.
It's a crap trick.

1209
01:20:05,897 --> 01:20:07,797
And I won't...
I won't do an accent,

1210
01:20:07,832 --> 01:20:09,891
however good...
however... however...

1211
01:20:09,934 --> 01:20:11,697
however good I
may be at them.

1212
01:20:11,736 --> 01:20:14,762
So that just leaves...
that's... that's just...

1213
01:20:14,806 --> 01:20:16,603
that's just singing.

1214
01:20:16,641 --> 01:20:18,609
Singing my speeches.

1215
01:20:18,643 --> 01:20:20,873
And then...
and after that,

1216
01:20:20,912 --> 01:20:23,437
arran... arranging to
have my...

1217
01:20:23,481 --> 01:20:25,847
have my... my...

1218
01:20:25,883 --> 01:20:28,750
have my ashes scattered

1219
01:20:28,786 --> 01:20:30,720
over the Plainsboro
Municipal Pond.

1220
01:20:36,961 --> 01:20:39,293
You know, I've...

1221
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:41,890
I've thought about
the whole... the singing,

1222
01:20:41,933 --> 01:20:43,560
and, uh...

1223
01:20:43,601 --> 01:20:45,569
I don't think
I can do it,

1224
01:20:45,603 --> 01:20:47,230
the song thing.

1225
01:20:47,271 --> 01:20:49,432
This is
"The Battle Hymn of the Republic. "

1226
01:20:49,473 --> 01:20:51,407
We might prefer something
more modern, I realize,

1227
01:20:51,442 --> 01:20:53,706
but this is the only piece
I can play all the way through.

1228
01:20:53,744 --> 01:20:55,712
What you're gonna do

1229
01:20:55,746 --> 01:20:58,271
is just learn the song well
enough to keep it in your head,

1230
01:20:58,316 --> 01:20:59,840
to let it flow through you

1231
01:20:59,884 --> 01:21:01,715
as you speak-sing
your speeches.

1232
01:21:01,752 --> 01:21:03,242
And we'll write
to fit the rhyme.

1233
01:21:35,086 --> 01:21:37,714
We think our case
will state

1234
01:21:37,755 --> 01:21:40,223
that sex is bound
to be explored...

1235
01:21:40,258 --> 01:21:43,159
- Abs... abstinence is the catalyst...
- Breathe.

1236
01:21:43,194 --> 01:21:46,027
- Breathe first.
- Abstinence is the catalyst...

1237
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:51,631
...to... to support
such a... such a...

1238
01:21:51,669 --> 01:21:53,569
- a far-ranging... platform.
- I got it.

1239
01:21:59,577 --> 01:22:01,772
Go away!

1240
01:22:09,587 --> 01:22:11,248
That's Dad's.

1241
01:22:11,289 --> 01:22:13,689
I thought you could use
a bigger suitcase...

1242
01:22:13,724 --> 01:22:15,316
one with an actual handle.

1243
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:17,827
I swear, Penelope,
I don't know what you would do

1244
01:22:17,862 --> 01:22:20,194
without someone in this family
who can steal and then organize.

1245
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:23,492
Could I have
a request, Earl?

1246
01:22:23,534 --> 01:22:25,695
If... if I win today,

1247
01:22:25,736 --> 01:22:28,102
could we say...
could we say that

1248
01:22:28,139 --> 01:22:30,607
you... you'll stop calling me
with girls' names?

1249
01:22:30,641 --> 01:22:32,939
Could we say that, if I win?

1250
01:22:34,845 --> 01:22:36,813
Let's not push it,
shall we?

1251
01:22:36,847 --> 01:22:39,179
Besides, Penelope's
my favorite girl's name.

1252
01:22:40,251 --> 01:22:42,879
All right, well,
could we... could we

1253
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:46,720
maybe just leave it
with Penelope then?

1254
01:22:47,959 --> 01:22:50,018
Yeah, we can do that.

1255
01:23:02,473 --> 01:23:04,373
Thank you and welcome

1256
01:23:04,408 --> 01:23:07,309
to the 43rd Annual New Jersey
State Debate Championships.

1257
01:23:07,345 --> 01:23:10,041
There are 22 schools
represented here

1258
01:23:10,081 --> 01:23:12,106
from every region
in the state.

1259
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,585
Every preliminary round
through the semifinals

1260
01:23:17,621 --> 01:23:19,384
will take place
in the classrooms

1261
01:23:19,423 --> 01:23:21,584
in the adjacent
academic buildings.

1262
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:23,957
You'll only return to this auditorium
at the end of the day

1263
01:23:23,995 --> 01:23:25,690
for the final round

1264
01:23:25,730 --> 01:23:27,527
and the presentation
of the trophy.

1265
01:23:27,565 --> 01:23:29,328
Now, before we begin,

1266
01:23:29,367 --> 01:23:32,063
I want you to give yourselves
a big round of applause.

1267
01:23:39,744 --> 01:23:42,611
That's right.

1268
01:23:42,646 --> 01:23:45,410
Now, pairings for the first
three rounds are randomized.

1269
01:23:45,449 --> 01:23:48,384
Then they're weighted
by win-lose record.

1270
01:23:48,419 --> 01:23:51,354
Would you sign this?

1271
01:23:51,389 --> 01:23:53,186
It's my favorite
brief of the year.

1272
01:23:53,224 --> 01:23:56,955
It says that abstinence
leads to a global crisis

1273
01:23:56,994 --> 01:23:58,985
in mental health.

1274
01:24:03,601 --> 01:24:05,569
Aren't you that Chinese boy?

1275
01:24:10,441 --> 01:24:12,909
I'm K-Korean, yes.

1276
01:24:12,943 --> 01:24:17,403
And just... just so... just so
that you're... that you're aware,

1277
01:24:17,448 --> 01:24:20,417
it's really ignorant to lump us
all into one category like that.

1278
01:24:26,457 --> 01:24:28,789
You all can't win,

1279
01:24:28,826 --> 01:24:32,660
but you are all winners.
Good luck to you.

1280
01:25:38,095 --> 01:25:40,893
You think our case
will state that sex

1281
01:25:40,931 --> 01:25:42,922
is bound to be explored,

1282
01:25:42,967 --> 01:25:44,935
that adding funds
for abstinence

1283
01:25:44,969 --> 01:25:48,063
is what I will
have roared.

1284
01:25:48,105 --> 01:25:51,438
But such a case has been
heard so much that we are bored.

1285
01:25:51,475 --> 01:25:54,000
Our plan is, thus,
not that.

1286
01:25:59,517 --> 01:26:02,008
Our... our...
uh... uh...

1287
01:26:02,052 --> 01:26:03,883
our... our...

1288
01:26:03,921 --> 01:26:06,856
our government can best
support teaching abstinence

1289
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:10,486
by refraining from
the common and ugly arrogance.

1290
01:26:10,528 --> 01:26:13,156
Instead of telling us
we should never do the dance

1291
01:26:13,197 --> 01:26:16,223
they should adopt this plan:

1292
01:26:16,267 --> 01:26:19,566
Amend the Constitution
so that no one over 20

1293
01:26:19,603 --> 01:26:22,401
can serve in government,
there'll be only kids a-plenty.

1294
01:26:22,439 --> 01:26:24,930
We'll... we'll...
write the laws and fix sex ed,

1295
01:26:24,975 --> 01:26:26,499
and it won't cost a penny.

1296
01:26:26,544 --> 01:26:29,411
That's our basic plan.

1297
01:26:29,446 --> 01:26:30,845
What we'll...
what we'll...

1298
01:26:30,881 --> 01:26:32,815
what we'll do is create
a new federal government

1299
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:34,600
where teenagers are only... are... are

1300
01:26:34,601 --> 01:26:36,581
the only... the only
voices of authority.

1301
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:38,451
By doing so... we'll help...
we'll help create

1302
01:26:38,489 --> 01:26:40,480
a... a wider consensus
among teens.

1303
01:26:40,524 --> 01:26:43,049
It's a more... it's a more dem...
it's more... it's more...

1304
01:26:43,093 --> 01:26:45,755
it's a more democratic system
and democracy is

1305
01:26:45,796 --> 01:26:48,264
the very basis for love

1306
01:26:48,299 --> 01:26:50,597
as we'll argue below
in the rest of my song-speech.

1307
01:26:52,136 --> 01:26:54,536
Now, please...
please turn to...

1308
01:26:54,572 --> 01:26:57,336
contingent...
contingent one of our plan.

1309
01:26:57,374 --> 01:26:59,740
Now... now... now, this one's
a little harder to get the whole...

1310
01:26:59,777 --> 01:27:02,075
the whole... the kinda...
the... the rhyme scheme for it,

1311
01:27:02,112 --> 01:27:03,807
because... uh, because
of all the quotes that say...

1312
01:27:03,847 --> 01:27:05,712
that have "sexologist" in them
which isn't really...

1313
01:27:05,749 --> 01:27:09,207
it doesn't... it doesn't
really rhyme with too much.

1314
01:27:09,253 --> 01:27:12,051
But it basically...
it basically goes like this:

1315
01:27:12,089 --> 01:27:15,581
The role... the role
of the sexologist...

1316
01:27:18,295 --> 01:27:20,525
Gentlemen, come with me.

1317
01:27:28,005 --> 01:27:30,769
- Ben.
- Marsha.

1318
01:27:30,808 --> 01:27:33,936
The bow tie,
the pretty boutonniere?

1319
01:27:33,978 --> 01:27:37,243
- Yes, sir, it stirs the pot a little.
- For me too, Coach.

1320
01:27:37,281 --> 01:27:40,148
- No, don't do that.
- Excuse me, Coach?

1321
01:27:40,184 --> 01:27:41,981
I'm... I'm... I'm like...

1322
01:27:42,019 --> 01:27:44,351
I'm a minute into my...
into my opening.

1323
01:27:44,388 --> 01:27:46,822
And, uh... well, uh...

1324
01:27:46,857 --> 01:27:49,951
well, I've... well, uh...
well, I'm killing in there.

1325
01:27:53,931 --> 01:27:55,523
Aren't I killing?

1326
01:27:55,566 --> 01:27:58,262
I've heard worse.

1327
01:27:58,302 --> 01:28:01,100
She's...
she's heard worse.

1328
01:28:01,138 --> 01:28:03,629
There was an objection raised
to your entering here today.

1329
01:28:03,674 --> 01:28:05,938
And the New Jersey League officials
have already voted on it

1330
01:28:05,976 --> 01:28:08,740
and it doesn't feel altogether
great to have to tell you this.

1331
01:28:08,779 --> 01:28:11,213
You're not home-schooled,
Mr. Hefner.

1332
01:28:11,248 --> 01:28:13,978
And working most days
at a dry-cleaner's, Mr. Wekselbaum,

1333
01:28:14,018 --> 01:28:15,815
means that you're not either.

1334
01:28:15,853 --> 01:28:18,321
You've been barred
from the competition.

1335
01:28:18,355 --> 01:28:20,880
You're welcome to stay
and observe if you like.

1336
01:28:33,237 --> 01:28:37,071
You know, we... we, uh...

1337
01:28:38,142 --> 01:28:40,167
might have actually
won the whole thing.

1338
01:28:42,012 --> 01:28:45,004
Probably not if you really
apply powers of reason to it.

1339
01:28:48,619 --> 01:28:50,712
So that's...
so... so...

1340
01:28:50,754 --> 01:28:53,222
uh... so that's...
that's it?

1341
01:28:55,326 --> 01:28:58,193
Come and visit me
sometime, if you want.

1342
01:28:58,228 --> 01:29:00,696
We'll reminisce about this
and what it means.

1343
01:29:31,362 --> 01:29:34,229
Teen sexual experimentation
in these programs...

1344
01:29:38,936 --> 01:29:42,804
Well, uh... uh...

1345
01:29:45,442 --> 01:29:47,239
today was not my day.
Okay?

1346
01:29:47,277 --> 01:29:50,610
But... but, uh...
but... but, uh...

1347
01:29:50,647 --> 01:29:53,582
some... someday will be.
And... and on... on that day,

1348
01:29:53,617 --> 01:29:56,552
you... you will be
sitting at home alone.

1349
01:29:57,988 --> 01:29:59,683
At home.

1350
01:29:59,723 --> 01:30:02,216
And you'll... you'll
think to yourself...

1351
01:30:02,217 --> 01:30:03,284
when you're alone

1352
01:30:03,327 --> 01:30:05,192
that... that... that...

1353
01:30:05,229 --> 01:30:07,322
I knew him when.

1354
01:30:07,364 --> 01:30:09,696
Him being me.

1355
01:30:11,702 --> 01:30:14,432
Anarchy is not only the best system
in which to encourage adult maturation,

1356
01:30:14,471 --> 01:30:16,905
it is also the best system in which
to encourage sexual liberation.

1357
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:19,374
Don't you dare go thinking
this was easy for me or simple!

1358
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:21,105
If you think my feelings
on the matter were clear,

1359
01:30:21,145 --> 01:30:22,772
then you'd be underestimating
my complexity.

1360
01:30:22,813 --> 01:30:24,713
And while I see that you
don't recognize this now,

1361
01:30:24,748 --> 01:30:26,079
you actually have me
to thank...

1362
01:30:26,116 --> 01:30:27,913
in part, modesty
forces me to acknowledge,

1363
01:30:27,951 --> 01:30:30,943
but in large part... for your newfound
zest of competition and gamesmanship.

1364
01:30:30,988 --> 01:30:33,320
That was very clever
of you, to find Ben.

1365
01:30:33,357 --> 01:30:35,951
Surprisingly clever
and very painful.

1366
01:30:35,993 --> 01:30:38,257
Which means that I upped
your game, little man.

1367
01:30:39,363 --> 01:30:41,354
You're welcome!

1368
01:30:41,398 --> 01:30:42,888
Liberation breeds liberation, i. e.

1369
01:30:42,933 --> 01:30:44,833
Sexual freedom
inspires political freedom.

1370
01:30:44,868 --> 01:30:47,496
At the heart of all liberty
is the liberty to engage...

1371
01:32:03,013 --> 01:32:05,106
Sir?

1372
01:32:05,148 --> 01:32:07,173
I will have one of...

1373
01:32:07,217 --> 01:32:08,980
I'll have one of the...

1374
01:32:09,019 --> 01:32:10,543
I'll have
a slice of your...

1375
01:32:10,587 --> 01:32:12,851
the... of...

1376
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:14,824
one of your...
one of your...

1377
01:32:14,858 --> 01:32:17,349
I'll have a slice
of the... of the...

1378
01:32:17,394 --> 01:32:19,885
the... the...
one of... what...

1379
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:21,625
I mean, you can
imagine it's not fish

1380
01:32:21,665 --> 01:32:24,293
because you don't
have any fish here.

1381
01:32:24,334 --> 01:32:26,632
At least I hope not.

1382
01:32:27,971 --> 01:32:30,235
It's good. Um...

1383
01:32:30,274 --> 01:32:32,868
but I'll have a slice
of the... of your...

1384
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:36,209
one of your... um,
slices of the... the...

1385
01:32:36,246 --> 01:32:39,738
the... the... the pizza.

1386
01:32:43,754 --> 01:32:45,915
You can pay me
when you're through.

1387
01:32:45,956 --> 01:32:47,856
You know, why don't
I make it not just...

1388
01:32:47,891 --> 01:32:50,257
not... not just...
not... not one...

1389
01:32:50,294 --> 01:32:52,057
not one slice, but, uh,

1390
01:32:52,095 --> 01:32:53,926
I'll have... I'll have...

1391
01:32:53,964 --> 01:32:55,591
not one.

1392
01:32:55,632 --> 01:32:57,156
I'm gonna close up in a bit.

1393
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,430
Why don't you just
take all three?

1394
01:32:59,469 --> 01:33:01,300
Otherwise they're
getting trashed.

1395
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:05,030
Yes!

1396
01:33:07,044 --> 01:33:10,104
Thank you.
Thanks.

1397
01:33:42,779 --> 01:33:45,304
Eventually,
all of this would pass.

1398
01:33:45,349 --> 01:33:47,613
And the memory of it
would give way to embellishment

1399
01:33:47,651 --> 01:33:51,052
and fantasy
and outright distortion

1400
01:33:51,088 --> 01:33:52,919
until it was hard
for Hal Hefner to remember

1401
01:33:52,956 --> 01:33:54,787
what he was
really like back then.

1402
01:33:54,825 --> 01:33:57,157
When he still carried
in his head the sound of

1403
01:33:57,194 --> 01:34:00,095
a madeup perfect voice,

1404
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:02,325
the voice that could
speak its heart,

1405
01:34:02,366 --> 01:34:05,096
the voice he used
to wish he had,

1406
01:34:05,135 --> 01:34:08,161
until the day he stopped wishing
he sounded like anyone else

1407
01:34:08,205 --> 01:34:10,070
and just started
talking as he was.

1408
01:34:29,226 --> 01:34:30,921
You okay?

1409
01:34:30,961 --> 01:34:32,792
Yeah, I'm okay.

1410
01:34:32,829 --> 01:34:35,889
But, uh, listen...

1411
01:34:38,301 --> 01:34:40,360
what do you...
what do you...

1412
01:34:40,404 --> 01:34:43,134
I mean, what are
your thoughts on...

1413
01:34:43,173 --> 01:34:45,038
like on... on...

1414
01:34:45,075 --> 01:34:46,770
on love?

1415
01:34:47,944 --> 01:34:50,037
Oh, man, it's so late, Hal.

1416
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,843
I, um...

1417
01:34:51,882 --> 01:34:56,581
I couldn't find
the... the off-ramp.

1418
01:34:56,620 --> 01:35:00,488
And I ended up
circling back three times.

1419
01:35:00,524 --> 01:35:02,549
And, uh...

1420
01:35:02,592 --> 01:35:05,459
I don't even know if I know
how to get you back to Plainsboro.

1421
01:35:07,864 --> 01:35:10,492
You know,
it shouldn't be...

1422
01:35:10,534 --> 01:35:13,867
shouldn't... it really
shouldn't be like rocket,

1423
01:35:13,904 --> 01:35:16,464
uh... shouldn't
be rocket, um...

1424
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:22,375
Sometimes, I don't know,

1425
01:35:22,412 --> 01:35:25,973
I guess I just
wonder when

1426
01:35:26,016 --> 01:35:29,110
it all starts
to make sense, you know?

1427
01:35:31,521 --> 01:35:33,887
All what?

1428
01:35:33,924 --> 01:35:36,222
All this.
You know, everything.

1429
01:35:37,294 --> 01:35:39,194
Oh.

1430
01:35:40,230 --> 01:35:43,097
Well, I guess
there comes a point,

1431
01:35:43,133 --> 01:35:46,728
you see, when you
reach a certain age

1432
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:50,069
and you're in Jersey,

1433
01:35:50,107 --> 01:35:52,075
or someplace just like it,

1434
01:35:52,109 --> 01:35:54,543
and...

1435
01:35:54,578 --> 01:35:57,138
you stop trying
to figure it all out.

1436
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:59,205
You just...

1437
01:36:01,985 --> 01:36:04,453
are glad
for what you have.

1438
01:36:04,488 --> 01:36:07,150
Oh.

1439
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:09,920
And that...
that... that...

1440
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:12,656
that just, like, happens
for everyone?

1441
01:36:12,696 --> 01:36:14,596
Yeah. Pretty much.

1442
01:36:16,533 --> 01:36:19,195
But you let me know if it
turns out different for you.

1443
01:36:19,236 --> 01:36:21,295
I'll do that.

1444
01:36:22,672 --> 01:36:24,799
I'll find...

1445
01:36:24,841 --> 01:36:27,435
a... a way... a g...

1446
01:36:27,477 --> 01:36:29,741
some good way

1447
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:31,805
of letting you know
how it all works out.
