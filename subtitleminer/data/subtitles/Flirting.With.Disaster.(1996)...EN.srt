00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:22,685
My mother could be rich.
She could be rich and smart.

2
00:00:24,287 --> 00:00:27,518
Or she could be rich and stupid.

3
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:31,122
On the other hand, she could be
just poor and good-hearted.

4
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:34,962
Or she could be poor and mean.

5
00:00:35,047 --> 00:00:39,006
I mean, I-I have no idea
what she's like. It's--

6
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:42,796
And there's my father, right?
I look at guys on the street every day--

7
00:00:42,887 --> 00:00:44,878
regular guys
walking down the street.

8
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:47,845
And depending on my mood, I imagine
that any one of them could be my father.

9
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:50,487
This guy.
How about this guy?

10
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:52,922
Hi, Dad.

11
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:56,196
Then I have to picture
these two people having sex.

12
00:00:56,287 --> 00:00:58,801
Okay, maybe they're not together now.
But at least 30 years ago...

13
00:00:58,887 --> 00:01:01,640
they had to hook up
in order to have me, right?

14
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:05,800
Mix and match, mix and match,
all these people together.

15
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:07,878
I can't help feeling...

16
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:11,039
that if I'd been raised
by at least one of my real parents...

17
00:01:11,127 --> 00:01:14,085
I wouldn't be
such a nervous person, you know?

18
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:18,558
I might be living a completely different
life in a totally different city.

19
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:21,525
I could be married to a totally
different person with a different job.

20
00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:24,679
I mean, how do I know? I don't.
Anything's possible.

21
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:31,718
Well, the mystery of your
unknown self is about to unfold.

22
00:01:31,807 --> 00:01:34,879
Your mother lives
in San Diego, California.

23
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:40,956
Her name is Valerie Swaney.

24
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:44,158
Valerie Swaney?

25
00:01:44,247 --> 00:01:46,886
I told you it wouldn't take long.

26
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:48,923
Can we arrange a meeting soon?

27
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:50,998
How's, um--
How's next month?

28
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:54,682
No, no. I told Nancy I'd do it sooner.
I-I've been driving her crazy.

29
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:56,678
Because you can't name your son?

30
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:59,804
I've just been distracted and tense
ever since the baby was born.

31
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:02,560
- A little unsteady?
- Preoccupied.

32
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:24,478
I heard a song 'bout
clouds and rainbows

33
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:28,765
I hum a tune
that sings like a dove

34
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:33,363
Found some words about anything

35
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:37,725
Anything but love

36
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:41,595
I paint a picture of my prison

37
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:46,556
With blue and grey
for the skies above

38
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:50,925
Framed and signed with a title

39
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:55,000
Anything but love

40
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:59,478
He had to go
but I won't miss him

41
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:03,799
I have got
better things to do

42
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:08,199
Like writing stories
and painting pictures

43
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:11,723
Of anything but love

44
00:03:12,847 --> 00:03:16,999
Oh, anything but love

45
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:21,000
Anything but love

46
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:25,796
Nancy?

47
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:29,838
I'm in the bedroom!

48
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,806
Big news.
I got big news.

49
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:38,038
Hi, sweetie. You look great.
Why are you dressed like that?

50
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:41,085
Did you forget about our date?

51
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:46,920
- No. It's okay, you're here now.
- No, no, no. I feel so bad.

53
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:49,043
We're not gonna fight about it.

54
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:51,721
Look at you.
You look so sexy.

55
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:55,802
But I want to tell you
what I forgot.

56
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:58,606
- Take your shoes off.
- No, no, wait, wait. We have to talk.

57
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:00,598
- We have to talk. Talk.
- No. No. Honey, no talking.

58
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:02,962
No, no, we have to talk
about wh-why I'm late.

59
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:06,323
- Control freak, huh?
- No. Yeah, maybe I am a control freak.
- Control freak.

60
00:04:06,407 --> 00:04:08,318
Don't!

61
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:19,963
- Nap time's over.
- Nap time's over.

62
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:22,356
Wait, wait. I'll get him.
I'll get him.

63
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:25,644
You don't have to put your pants on
to get the baby.

64
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:34,204
Honey, do you think
we're ever gonna have sex?

65
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:36,517
Definitely.

66
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:42,199
There, buddy, Yeah.
How ya doin'?

67
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:45,245
It's okay. Yeah, yeah.
You okay?

68
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,046
- We'll be out in one second.
- Oh.

69
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:50,004
I feel like I'm keeping you
from something.

70
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:52,237
No. No, no, no.
This is a priority.

71
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:55,239
Is this a bad time for your wife?
'Cause, you know, I could come back.

72
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:58,205
Not at all. We just need
a couple of minutes.

73
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:01,845
This is crazy.

74
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,999
I mean, all right, I feel guilty
'cause I missed the date.

75
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:08,841
I just gotta tell her. What am I
afraid of, right? This is stupid.

76
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:14,044
- Hey, here you go.
- No, no. This is good.

77
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:16,641
- What?
- This is good. You stay with Daddy.

78
00:05:16,727 --> 00:05:20,083
- Keep his hands occupied.
- Oh, Nancy. Nancy. No, no, no.

79
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:23,842
Honey. Honey.
Can't we make another date, please?

80
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:28,318
Thi-- Sweetie, this is--
Sweetie, he's looking right down at you.

81
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:32,116
This isn't-- Oh. Oh, no, no. No.

82
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,641
No. Oh, no, no, no.

83
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:38,726
My real mother lives in San Diego.

84
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:40,798
- What?
- That's what I was trying to tell you.

85
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:43,196
I went to the adoption agency,
and they found my real mother.

86
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:45,198
Just like that?
You walked in, they found her?

87
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:47,198
Well, it was the second
trip, actually.

88
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:49,482
- Ohh.
- I know, I know.

89
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,478
- Honey.
- I know. So listen...

90
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:54,035
why don't you put something on
and come over and say hello to Tina.

91
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:57,597
- Who?
- The woman who helped
arrange everything.

92
00:05:57,687 --> 00:06:00,360
This woman's in our apartment
right now? She's here?

93
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,325
Yeah. Well I-- You know,
I-I was trying to tell you before...

94
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:05,682
but you got all sexed up
and everything--

95
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:08,998
Well, I got sexed up
because we had a date, not because
I'm some kind of freak or something.

96
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:11,043
- I didn't say you were a freak.
Did I say you were a freak, honey?
- No.

97
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:13,925
- No, no. Come on, this is good, right?
- Hi. I'm Tina Kalb.

98
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,998
I'm sorry to burst in on you
like this...

99
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:18,362
but Mel said he didn't
want to waste any time.

100
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:21,086
That's all right. Nancy understands
how important this whole thing is.

101
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,886
- Great. The baby's gorgeous,
by the way. It looks just like Mel.
- Ohh.

102
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,039
Thanks. Really? You really think so?
Everybody always says he looks like me.

103
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:30,881
Well, what do I know?
I'm just another 30-year-old woman
desperate for a baby of her own.

104
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:33,083
Your husband
doesn't want to have kids?

105
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,158
Yeah, I'm in the middle
of a divorce, actually.

106
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:37,920
I just can't seem
to part with the ring.

107
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:41,841
- Sorry.
- Oh, no. You know, it was
one of those death marriages--

108
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:44,487
you know, the kind where you
have to start making dates to have sex.

109
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:50,280
Well, I'm sure it'll work out. I mean,
I'm sure you'll meet somebody else...

110
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,517
and you'll be happy
and you'll fall in love again...

111
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:55,326
- and things'll just be wonderful.
- Yeah, I don't know.

112
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:57,318
I think it might be easier
at this point...

113
00:06:57,407 --> 00:06:59,716
just to find an intelligent man
to impregnate me.

114
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:04,159
I'm sorry. I don't understand
exactly who you are.

115
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:06,397
Oh, didn't I tell you?
She's-She's doing the study.

116
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:08,955
I'm gonna be coming along
to San Diego next week...

117
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:10,958
to document the reunion.

118
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:13,845
In fact, Nancy, I've got
some waivers that I need you to sign.

119
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:17,044
You see, there's such a dearth
of in-depth documentation...

120
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:19,925
into the psychological impact
that these reunions have...

121
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:23,920
on, for instance, you, the spouse,
as well as Mel's adoptive family.

122
00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:26,362
- Ah, so you're a psychologist?
- Not quite.

123
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,722
I'm just finishing my doctorate.

124
00:07:28,807 --> 00:07:30,957
Tina used to be a dancer.

125
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:34,926
Oh, those days are long gone. I--
Listen, I've gotta call the office.

126
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:38,158
Oh, there's a phone in the kitchen.
It's right there on your left.

127
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:40,715
- Got one right here.
- Well, next week?

128
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:42,320
- Yeah, yeah.
- God, that's soon.

129
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:45,763
Well, they're gonna pay for everything.
Isn't that great, sweetie? Honey?

130
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:52,406
After I had my baby,
I wanted my husband to stay home...

131
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:54,398
and help with night feedings...

132
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:57,081
not drag me on some plane
for San Diego.

133
00:07:57,167 --> 00:08:00,204
I like travelling.
The baby's five months old.

134
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:02,960
I really think this is gonna get us
closer together.

135
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:07,723
Oh, honey, after you're married,
he feels like he's kissing his mother
half the time, anyway.

136
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:12,642
Our kissing is still nice, but he's
so controlling about the oral sex.

137
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:15,036
Well, have you tried
the warm water method?

138
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,118
- Are you kidding?
- No.
- You're kidding.

139
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:19,323
- No.Joe loves it.
- Hey.

140
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:21,398
- Oh, hi, Mel.
- Hi.
- Look what I found.

141
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:23,398
What did you find?

142
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,003
- What made you dig these out?
- Remember?

143
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:29,396
I don't know. I was just feeling
nostalgic for some reason.

144
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:33,480
That's so sweet. We found these
on our first field trip together.

145
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:37,355
Very sweet. Oh, congratulations
on finding your mother, Mel.

146
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:40,678
- Thank you.
- That oughta settle
some big issues for you, huh?

147
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:42,997
Definitely. Which issues
are you talking about?

148
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:47,524
- Starting with the whole sex thing.
- Sex. Baby's name. The baby's name.

149
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:49,962
- 'Cause you said Ethan--
- No, no, wait a minute.
She just said the sex thing.

150
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:52,197
- You said that Ethan was too feminine.
- Right.

151
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:55,563
- We were trying to think of a more
masculine baby name, right? So--
- Okay, but she said the sex thing.

152
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:57,877
- Didn't you just say the sex thing?
- But she meant that.

153
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:00,527
- Well, why don't you just let her
speak for herself? Wh-What did you mean?
- Well, tell him. Tell him. Go on.

154
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,326
Actually, it was oral sex
I was referring to.

155
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:05,637
Oral sex, really?
I think I just walked in...

156
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:08,082
- on a ladies' conversation
that guys aren't supposed to--
- No, you didn't.

157
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:10,476
- Yes, I-- I'm gonna go.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I'm gonna leave.
- No, stay.

158
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:13,320
- No. No. Leave.
- Don't go. Come on.
- Go. Stay? No.

159
00:09:13,407 --> 00:09:15,716
- Honey, we weren't talking about us.
- I-- What?

160
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:17,718
- We wouldn't-- I wouldn't--
- No. I know.
- You've gotta know that.

161
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,526
- I know that so much.
- Bye.
- So true.

162
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:23,121
Hey, I didn't go around telling my
friends you didn't want to make love...

163
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:25,482
for almost two months
after the baby was born, did I?

164
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:29,082
- Probably.
- Okay, but it didn't
get back to you, did it? Huh?

165
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:34,517
Are you sure you're okay
about this woman coming along?
It's not weird or anything?

166
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:38,520
Well, it's a little strange
to be travelling with a chaperone.

167
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:43,000
But if you're okay with it,
I'm okay with it.

168
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:47,717
Well, it's just, she's been through
the process so many times.
I think it's a good thing.

169
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:52,039
Honey, if this helps you
get what you need inside...

170
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,925
- then I'm all for it.
- Thanks, sweetie.

171
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,920
This cheese is disgusting.
Get it away from me.

172
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:02,043
- What's wrong with this cheese?
- It smells like vomit.

173
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:05,085
- Oh, stop being such a baby.
- Mom, Dad, this is Tina.
- I'm a baby who smells like vomit?

174
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:08,159
- Yes.
- You okay?
- Nancy, did you get
that support bra yet?

175
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:11,398
- Not yet.
- What are you waiting for?
- Hey, I want to introduce you
to somebody.

176
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:13,842
Please don't make
such a big deal out of it.

177
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,999
- It makes a real difference.
- All right, could we not talk
about this right now?

178
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:21,239
Uh, yes, we're gonna talk about this
because she's not listening to me.

179
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:24,319
- I want you to see something.
- Ohh.
- Very nice, Pearl.
- For God's sake.

180
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:28,446
- I want you to consider my age
and ask yourself how I maintain this.
- Mom, why are you doing this?

181
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,519
- How? I don't know. How?
- This is it. All right, can we
not deal with this right now, please?
- I couldn't have a baby.

182
00:10:31,607 --> 00:10:33,598
But I had to fight the laws
of gravity just the same...

183
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:36,201
and you need the help
of a good bra.

184
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:39,643
And believe you me, if you want
to keep your husband's attention,
you'll get one pronto.

185
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:42,525
You know, if my breasts drop, they drop,
and there's nothing I can do about that.

186
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:44,563
- Wrong!
- That's right. Good for you, honey.

187
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:47,081
- Wrong!
-Just back off, will ya?
- You've had five of these.

188
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,203
- I don't think--
- Don't monitor me.

189
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:52,757
- Your new friend is, uh,
very long-waisted, isn't she?
- Okay, that's it!

190
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:55,486
- We're not talking
about this any more, okay?
- It's a free country.

191
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:58,035
- Why can't I talk?
- Let him alone.

192
00:10:58,127 --> 00:11:00,561
You're making an ass
out of yourself again!

193
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:04,481
- Why don't you leave me alone!
Why don't you just have a little sniff?
- Don't do that. Hey, hey.

194
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:07,400
- The baby's crying.
- Get that away from me,
or I'll smack it off.

195
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:10,047
- Yeah, you're gonna beat me up
in front of all these people?
- Don't tempt me!

196
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,960
Would you stop acting like this?
That's it! All right?

197
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:17,199
- Don't yell in front of the baby.
- Don't yell in front of the baby.
It's not good.

198
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:19,596
Well, he wouldn't have to yell
if you'd listen to him for two seconds!

199
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:22,804
Well, what's gotten into my sweet
daughter-in-law all of a sudden?

200
00:11:22,887 --> 00:11:26,004
- Hormones. No mystery there.
- Does this baby have a name yet?

201
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:28,521
- Four months old, doesn't have a name.
- Well, don't blame me.

202
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:30,996
- I like the name Ethan.
- Oh, no, no. Ethan's too lame.

203
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:35,717
- Everything's too lame, too bold.
- This is becoming an embarrassing,
neurotic thing, Mel.

204
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,844
It's not an embarrassing, neurotic
thing. This is about my real identity.

205
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:41,282
- It's about my background, okay?
- Don't be ridiculous.

206
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,403
You're Mel Coplin.
That's who you are.

207
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,082
You know, this process will go
a long way towards clarifying
that identity issue.

208
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:50,443
What process? Who is this new friend
with the camera already?

209
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:52,882
I've only been trying to introduce
you to her for the last ten minutes.

210
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:55,879
- Her name is Tina Kalb, and she's here
for a very important reason.
- You're getting a divorce.

211
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:59,004
-She's a counsellor. No, she's a lawyer.
-Would you-- Would you just zip it?

212
00:11:59,087 --> 00:12:01,726
- Don't talk to your mother like that.
- We're not getting a divorce.

213
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:04,082
Maybe you should
if you can't name the baby.

214
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:07,204
- That is a terrible,
sick thing to say, Ed!
- You said it first!

215
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:10,165
- That's no excuse!
- If you say it, fine.
If I say it, I'm sick.

216
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:12,602
- Maybe.
- Tina is with the adoption agency.

217
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:16,566
- What adoption agency?
- The adoption agency
where you adopted me.

218
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:20,083
- When I was a little baby, remember?
- Oh, my God!

219
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:26,755
Oh, God. I have to have a cigarette
if we're gonna talk about this.

220
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:30,556
- Can I bum one of those?
- No, you can't smoke around the baby.

221
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:36,404
- Show a little compassion, will you?
- This might be a good time
to make an exception. For her.

222
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:40,366
- Pearl!
- I'd like to know what happened
to the Constitution in this country.

223
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:43,564
- Please, can you please put it out?
- Oh, all right, all right!

224
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:48,277
Why does he have to do this roots thing?
Aren't we good enough parents?

225
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:52,280
I think you probably
did the best that you could,
but psychic scars can't be helped.

226
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:55,677
Psychic scars?
What is she talking about?

227
00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:04,001
She's saying we failed completely.

228
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:08,126
- That's way too extreme.
- Yeah, maybe just 40 percent.

229
00:13:08,207 --> 00:13:10,960
Mom, you can't quantify it like that.
I mean, what difference does it make...

230
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:13,402
if it's 40 percent or 60 percent?

231
00:13:13,487 --> 00:13:15,398
Sixty percent?

232
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:18,081
Why is everybody getting
so serious all of a sudden?

233
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:20,158
I thought we were gonna talk
about buying new carpeting...

234
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:23,125
getting rid of this crap,
putting in the wall-to-wall.

235
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:25,675
Life is so rich, so full.

236
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:28,918
You have a wife,
a child, a good job.

237
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:31,396
Why are you doing this?

238
00:13:31,487 --> 00:13:36,163
If I could pop in here for a second,
I think that what Mel is trying
to communicate here...

239
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:40,320
is that no matter where we are in our
lives, especially if we're adopted...

240
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:43,240
we can't help but feel
that there's something missing--

241
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:47,445
that there's something out there
that's going to make us feel...

242
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:51,486
complete, give us a sense of belonging,
connectedness if you will.

243
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:55,196
This woman strikes me
as being very dangerous.

244
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:57,847
It's understandable
that you would find me threatening.

245
00:13:57,927 --> 00:14:00,521
Why don't you psychoanalyze me?
I'd love to hear this. Go ahead.

246
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:04,236
I'm, uh, abrasive,
pushy, defensive.

247
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:07,080
My husband is, uh, food-phobic,
passive-aggressive.

248
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:10,796
- Huh? Come on. Come on.
- Look, the point is, we're going
to San Diego in the morning, and--

249
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:12,923
What about your father's 60th birthday?

250
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:16,920
Well, if you'd let me finish what
I'm saying, I'd say that we have every
intention of coming back for it.

251
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:20,317
You are aware that they have a very big
car theft problem in San Diego.

252
00:14:20,407 --> 00:14:23,205
- No, I wasn't aware of that.
- Oh, yes, very big.

253
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:25,323
I hadn't heard anything
about that either.

254
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:28,080
They bump you,
and when you stop...

255
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,078
they mutilate you
and then take your car.

256
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,601
- It happened to Art Sackhein.
- What?

257
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:35,121
- They killed Art Sackhein?
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

258
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,085
They bumped him and took his car.
Nobody said anything about killing.

259
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:41,921
- You said mutilate.
- Anyway--
- Please.

260
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:45,636
Enjoy yourself. I understand
they have a lovely zoo in San Diego.

261
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:52,644
- Are you ready for San Diego?
- Yeah!
- Yes.

262
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:55,002
- God, you look beautiful.
- So do you.

263
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:56,998
Oh, thanks.
You know, maybe I'll just--

264
00:14:57,087 --> 00:14:59,123
I'll run upstairs really quickly
and change, 'cause I don't think--

265
00:14:59,207 --> 00:15:01,641
- Don't be silly. You look adorable.
- You look so elegant.
- Honey.

266
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:04,924
- I love that print. Come on.
- Honey, you look great. Come on.

267
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,039
Do you have the keys?

268
00:15:10,127 --> 00:15:13,722
I left with the feeling
this road was endless

269
00:15:13,807 --> 00:15:18,961
Now it seems there's three days
to heaven, it's okay

270
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:22,926
'Cause these wheels
are takin'me home again

271
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:25,396
It's all right

272
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:28,957
I've got three days to heaven
then I'm gonna make you mine

273
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,837
Boy, it's beautiful, here, isn't it?

274
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:39,680
Sweetie, I'm so happy
we're doing this together.

275
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:41,883
- Watch the road, please.
- Me too.

276
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:44,037
- How's the baby's diaper?
- He's fine.

277
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,085
- Good.
- What's that?

278
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:50,757
Oh, my God. It's happening. Shit!

279
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:52,644
- Oh, God, no.
- What's happening?

280
00:15:52,727 --> 00:15:55,924
It's the bump and rob.
This is it.

281
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:57,838
- Get down!
- What? What?
- Get down with the baby!

282
00:15:57,927 --> 00:15:59,963
- He's gaining on us!
- Yo, slow down!

283
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:02,481
- Back off, Jack!
- Pull over!

284
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:05,240
- How do you close this window?
- Wait. I've got some Mace in my bag.
- Damn it.

285
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:08,444
- It's not working!
- Listen to what he has to say.
- Here it is.

286
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:11,439
- Mace him!
- Yeah, get him!
- No!

287
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:13,438
Fucker!

288
00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:17,799
You left your jacket
in the parking lot.

289
00:16:17,887 --> 00:16:20,037
Asshole!

290
00:16:20,127 --> 00:16:23,039
Thank you for the jacket.
Sorry about the Mace.

291
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:24,719
Very sorry, sir.

292
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:31,841
''The Trinity Church Ministry of Hope.''
Oh, my God!

293
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,756
They bump you,
and when you stop...

294
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:41,317
they mutilate you
and take your car.

295
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:45,002
- I don't think it's funny at all.
I mean, his father created this fear--
- It is too funny.
- It's funny.

296
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,965
- Would you two, both of you,
just stop, please?
- And then--
- We're almost there.

297
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:53,041
- I'm getting nervous.
- Really, I'm not surprised
at his reaction or by my reaction.

298
00:17:05,247 --> 00:17:09,081
- Okay, just breathe.
- Ohh.

299
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:12,716
- Should I ring the doorbell?
- Okay.

300
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:15,196
- I mean, no. Wait, wait, wait.
I told you to wait.
- You said yes first.

301
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:17,517
- You didn't give me a chance to say no.
- Well, I would've, but--

302
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:20,075
- Hi!
- Hi.
- Hi.

303
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:24,285
Oh, what a pretty wife you have!
And I see you've brought your nanny.

304
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:27,996
- Oh, I'm not the nanny. I'm the wife.
- Oh, excuse me.

305
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:30,647
- What a terrible way to start.
- Oh, don't be silly.

306
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:33,400
I'm Tina Kalb from
the Maidstone Adoption Agency.

307
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:36,524
- Right.
- Hi.
- Hi.

308
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:39,121
- Valerie Swaney.
- Mel Coplin.

309
00:17:43,287 --> 00:17:45,517
- This is great.
I love the stained glass.
- Lovely.

310
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:49,441
- Thank you.
- Oh!
- Now, he was a great president.

311
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,882
You know, I always felt like
I should've appreciated him more.

312
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:55,243
I know just what you mean.
Come on, let's get something to drink.

313
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:01,998
Your daddy was short.

314
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:05,598
That would explain it.

315
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:08,645
And we have the same forehead,
don't we?

316
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:12,197
And the same eyes. Oh.

317
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:17,202
This is amazing. I never shared
physical traits with family before.

318
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,806
I'm a bad person
for what I did to you.

319
00:18:22,887 --> 00:18:25,321
- No, don't say that.
- It's true.

320
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,922
Look, Tina says that most women
who gave up their children
for adoption in the '60s...

321
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:33,523
were independent young women
acting against a conservative world.

322
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:38,560
- You're sayin' I was a slut?
- No.

323
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:42,003
- Oh, God!
- I didn't think-- You're not a slut.

324
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:45,045
I was tall,
and I developed earlier--

325
00:18:45,127 --> 00:18:48,836
If that's a crime, go ahead and sue me,
but I am not from trashy people.

326
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,602
- Really, I wasn't
suggesting that at all.
- Your daddy was poor.

327
00:18:52,687 --> 00:18:55,838
He worked in my father's
liquor warehouse in Baton Rouge.

328
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,760
- Really? Baton Rouge.
- That's where you were conceived.

329
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,486
In the liquor warehouse
on the cement floor...

330
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:05,606
- Wow!
- in Baton Rouge.
Oh, my parents hated Lars.

331
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:09,236
- Lars Waara was his name.
- Waara? Lars Waara!

332
00:19:09,327 --> 00:19:12,160
- What kind of name is that?
- Finnish.

333
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:14,715
- Finnish? I'm Finnish.
- I knew that.

334
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:17,002
I mean, look at your face.
Absolutely.

335
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:19,317
Finnish-American.
Half Scottish-American.

336
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:23,366
Scottish-Finnish. What is that?
I don't know how to do that. That's--

337
00:19:24,807 --> 00:19:27,367
I'm gonna help.
I'm gonna help you with that.

338
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:31,235
This belonged to my
great-great-grandmama
who was of the Clan Bucanon...

339
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:34,524
- Wow!
- married to the Confederate
General Beauregard.

340
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:37,360
- I want you to have it.
- A Confederate general?

341
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:40,359
Mm-hmm.
Expert boxer and marksman.

342
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:43,007
- Really? Wow!
- Wow!
- What an athletic family, huh?

343
00:19:43,087 --> 00:19:47,046
- I was on two championship
basketball teams myself.
- I'm not athletic at all.

344
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:50,915
- Look at this picture. This is--
Let's name the baby Beauregard, huh?
- Beauregard?

345
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:52,918
- Beau. Beau Coplin.
- Beau?
- I'm so touched.

346
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:54,998
- Beau Coplin. Ah, yeah!
- Oh, damn it!

347
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:58,238
- What?
- The camera just jammed.
- You didn't get that just now?

348
00:19:58,327 --> 00:20:01,399
- No, and that was a terrific moment.
- Let me see.
- Forget the camera.

349
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:03,921
- No, I can't.
- No, forget-- That's-- Forget about it.

350
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:06,999
- What? Don't you want
to get it on tape?
- I'd like to have it on tape.

351
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:09,760
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Uh, the light's better
in the living room.

352
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:12,680
- Look, honey, I'll be right back, okay?
- I-I don't know what happened.

353
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:17,921
- He's a very decisive man, isn't he?
- Well, actually he's not.
But today, for some reason--

354
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:21,158
Do you see that, that wheel in there?
There's like a glob of gunk.

355
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:24,205
- Yeah, I do.
- Tar.
- We need something to wipe it off with.

356
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:28,246
- If we could get like a--
- What? You know what? I don't--
Let's just use my skirt.

357
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,795
- Your skirt?
- I don't care about it. It's old.
- Really? Okay.

358
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:33,117
-Just hold this, okay?
- Okay. Here.

359
00:20:33,207 --> 00:20:36,643
-Just-- If you can--
- Hold still.
- Yeah. Okay.

360
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:39,605
I'm Beauregard from Dixie, hooray--

361
00:20:39,687 --> 00:20:41,723
Technically, he's from New York.
Right?

362
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,480
- I'm sorry. Oh. I'm sorry.
- Well--

363
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:47,001
- Uh, you got it, though. You got it.
- Good.

364
00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:49,885
- Yeah. So how long did you say
you were a dancer for?
- Oh, God, don't remind me.

365
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:52,879
- I haven't been to the gym in months.
- Well, you don't seem like
you need to go to the gym.

366
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:55,003
- I mean--
- Well, you're very generous.

367
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:59,080
- Yeah.
- But when I was dancing, you know,
my calves did not look like this.

368
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:01,920
- Those look like
very strong calves to me.
- Well, strong, yeah.

369
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:04,601
They've always been strong.
When I was a kid, you know...

370
00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:07,599
I used to beat my brothers
at Indian wrestling all the time.

371
00:21:07,687 --> 00:21:10,963
Away down south in Dixie

372
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:13,720
He's a little cracker.

373
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,718
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not a cracker.
- You can't deny--

374
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,126
- I'm not a cracker!
- Ohh.

375
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:20,277
You feel it in your legs?

376
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,562
It's really more about upper-body
strength, isn't it?

377
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:25,036
- No, it's all in the legs.
- How?

378
00:21:25,127 --> 00:21:27,357
You'll see
when you lose your balance.

379
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:33,806
- Oh!
- What in the world?

380
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:36,765
Oh, my Lord!

381
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:39,964
My Chinese zodiac is ruined!

382
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:43,323
- I am so sorry. I really feel badly.
- Oh, my goodness. My animals.
- What else happened?

383
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:46,638
- We were just in here,
and then, um, freak accident.
- I'm so sorry.

384
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:50,037
- Yeah.Just--
- The shelf--
- What happened to the tail
of my rooster?

385
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:52,436
- You mean-- Is this it, maybe?
- No.

386
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:54,722
- That's the dog's pillow.
Oh.

387
00:21:54,807 --> 00:21:57,037
Well, don't throw it!

388
00:21:57,127 --> 00:21:59,436
I want to pay for all this.
Can I do that, please?

389
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,643
- Absolutely not.
- Why not?

390
00:22:01,727 --> 00:22:04,321
All children break things,
and all children are forgiven.

391
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:07,399
Now, you have never had
that opportunity with me.

392
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:10,923
Let's take this
as a gift from God.

393
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:15,159
And look, here's
another gift from God.

394
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:18,364
Ohhh, well, why is that
a gift from God?

395
00:22:18,447 --> 00:22:22,520
The rabbit is still in one piece,
and both you and your daddy
were Year of the Rabbit.

396
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,963
I always thought it was
Year of the Dragon, at least in all
those Chinese restaurant place mats.

397
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:29,562
No, no, no. Lars is 1939.
You're 1963.

398
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:33,003
- Those are both rabbit years.
- Actually, I was born in '65.

399
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:39,924
- Don't you think I know
when my own son was born?
- 'Course you do, Valerie.

400
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:43,204
Wait, that would make me two years
older than I thought I was. Wow!

401
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:47,758
- How? How is that?
- You know what? I can clear this up
with one phone call to the office.

402
00:22:47,847 --> 00:22:52,125
- Yeah, why don't you make sure?
This really-- It kind of freaks me out.
- Mom, why are those cars here?

403
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:55,597
- Hey, girls, look who's here!
- What happened to your glass animals?

404
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:58,076
Oh, these are my twins
from my third marriage.

405
00:22:58,167 --> 00:23:00,965
- This is Jane, and this is Sandra.
- Hello.

406
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:04,676
- This is your half brother, Mel.
- He looks just like Uncle Freddie.
- Oh, man!

407
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:07,076
- Look at his nose.
- What's so funny?

408
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:10,204
- What's so funny?
- He looks just like Uncle Freddie.

409
00:23:10,287 --> 00:23:13,040
Yes, he does.
Why didn't I see that?

410
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:15,197
Oh, Uncle Freddie. I'm flattered.
What's he like?

411
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:17,926
He's really sweet-natured. He's just
that weird thing. What do you call it?

412
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:20,043
- ''Frateurist.''
- Yeah, he's a frateurist.

413
00:23:20,127 --> 00:23:24,405
- Frateurist? What's that?
- You rub up against people
in crowded public places.

414
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:26,717
- That's how I met Mel.
- Seriously?

415
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:29,241
- No, she's kidding.
- This is not something to kid about.

416
00:23:29,327 --> 00:23:32,603
- Yeah. He went to jail for it.
- Oh.
- Can he come to the beach?

417
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:35,360
- Oh, honey, I don't think
he's got time for that, Jane.
- Why not?

418
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,519
- We're in the volleyball finals.
- He can wear one of my shirts.
- Oh, yeah, give him a shirt.

419
00:23:38,607 --> 00:23:41,883
- We'll go down to the beach. This is--
- You girls!
- We're in the championship.

420
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:43,525
- Oh, man, you should've
been there yesterday.
- Wow. Uh-huh.

421
00:23:43,607 --> 00:23:45,916
- It was so amazing.
- It was match point.
- Match point.

422
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:49,044
- I went up for the spike.
- She went up for the spike.
- Shut up. Let me talk.

423
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,436
- So I went up for the spike.
- It was so intense.
She went up for the spike--
- Shut up!

424
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:55,156
- Girls, girls, calm down!
- Listen, I, I, I don't believe this...

425
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:58,000
but there's been
a terrible, terrible mistake.

426
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:00,521
And Valerie's
not your mother, Mel.

427
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,996
- What?
- What are you talking about?
Of course she's my mother.

428
00:24:03,087 --> 00:24:06,124
- We have the same forehead.
- And he looks like Uncle Freddie.
- Yeah, I look like Uncle Freddie.

429
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:09,165
Please, just don't make this any harder
on yourself than it already is.

430
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,158
- Are you positive?
- Yes.
- He's not our brother?

431
00:24:11,247 --> 00:24:13,363
How could you make
a mistake like that? I--

432
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:15,756
Well, our computer files
were in transition...

433
00:24:15,847 --> 00:24:18,805
and Valerie's son
is named Martin Coplin...

434
00:24:18,887 --> 00:24:22,675
- and he lives in Orlando, Florida--
- What? My son? Who is this man?

435
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:26,965
Not your son. Mel,
your father is named, uh...

436
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:29,641
Fritz Boudreau,
and he lives in Gundall, Michigan.

437
00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:33,561
- So I was thinking, maybe on our way
to New York, we could stop off or--
- Who are these people in my home?

438
00:24:33,647 --> 00:24:36,115
-I feel like a complete idiot. I'm so--
-Well, I take these people into my home.

439
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:39,438
- I know.
- We fly all the way out here,
we have this big, tearful reunion--
- Their child is here.

440
00:24:39,527 --> 00:24:42,200
Yeah, well, get it out, Nancy. It's
gonna make us all feel a lot better.

441
00:24:42,287 --> 00:24:44,596
- Are you humouring me?
- No, I am not humouring you.
- I don't think this is funny.

442
00:24:44,687 --> 00:24:47,679
- I'm very serious. I certainly don't--
- Excuse-- No, excuse me!
I expect you to pay for this damage.

443
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:51,885
Well, w-wait a minute. You said
it was a gift from God. Remember?

444
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:53,878
That's when you were my son.

445
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:57,039
- Well, don't you have
insurance or something?
- And raise my premiums?

446
00:24:57,127 --> 00:25:00,483
No, thank you. May I have
my pendant back, please?

447
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:04,401
- Can we have our shirt back?
- We'd let you keep it. It's just that
we don't have very many of them.

448
00:25:04,487 --> 00:25:07,399
- Yeah. There's only, like, ten left.
- Yeah. No, sure.
- I'm sorry.

449
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:11,036
- Sorry.
- I understand.
- Thanks.

450
00:25:11,127 --> 00:25:14,164
- Have a nice life.
- Yeah, good luck with this
whole family thing, you know.

451
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:16,886
- Thank you.
- I hope it works out for you.

452
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:19,276
You have my other knee pad?

453
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:27,118
How could you be related? How?

454
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:31,723
She is a six-foot blonde descendant
from the clan Bucanon.

455
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:34,526
We were only trying
to be open to them.

456
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:37,405
Well, we could be open with them,
but we don't have to become them.

457
00:25:37,487 --> 00:25:40,957
I thought she was my mother.
Come on, give me a break.

458
00:25:43,287 --> 00:25:46,962
How did you happen to knock down
those glass shelves, anyway?

459
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,358
I don't know. I just--

460
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:55,123
You know, we were trying to fix
the camera, and we bumped into them.

461
00:25:55,207 --> 00:25:58,961
It's strange you would just
happen to bump into them.

462
00:25:59,047 --> 00:26:02,039
Well, we were also
Indian wrestling.

463
00:26:03,487 --> 00:26:06,923
Indian wrestling?
What is that?

464
00:26:07,007 --> 00:26:11,398
It's just this game that kids play.
It's a very innocent little kids' game.

465
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,443
Why were you playing that?

466
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:18,602
Because we were talking
about athleticism in Tina's family...

467
00:26:18,687 --> 00:26:22,566
and then how Valerie's family
was athletic also, and-- I don't know.

468
00:26:32,527 --> 00:26:36,600
- You're attracted to her, aren't you?
- No.

469
00:26:36,687 --> 00:26:39,247
That's okay.
She's attractive.

470
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:42,876
Yeah, she's attractive,
but I'm, I'm married to you.

471
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:45,481
You know, she may be attractive,
but she's got a screw loose.

472
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:47,797
Yes, I agree with you.
She's very eccentric.

473
00:26:47,887 --> 00:26:51,880
But I'm definitely--
I'm in love with you, honey. Honey?

474
00:26:53,007 --> 00:26:56,124
The revolution
came and left today

475
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,564
Nobody knew it came and went

476
00:27:02,647 --> 00:27:05,525
And so did Judgement Day

477
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:09,645
In somebody else's body

478
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:11,683
With someone else's head

479
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:16,006
In somebody else's body

480
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:19,716
When I was someone else instead

481
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:22,924
In somebody else's body

482
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:25,202
With someone else's head

483
00:27:25,287 --> 00:27:29,565
When you're in somebody else's body

484
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:33,686
- In someone else's bed
- Hey, I think this is the place.

485
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:45,641
- This looks muy macho, doesn't it?
- Creepy to me.

486
00:27:45,727 --> 00:27:47,638
Oh, no, look.
Somebody's coming out, Mel.

487
00:27:47,727 --> 00:27:50,480
Hey! Hi!

488
00:27:51,687 --> 00:27:55,316
- Excuse me. Is one of you fellows
Fritz Boudreau?
- Hey!

489
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,524
- Did I invite you onto my property?
- Hey, take it easy! Take it easy!

490
00:27:58,607 --> 00:28:02,395
- Tina, don't go over there!
- Hey! Oh, my God!

491
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:06,036
Would you let me explain?
We can talk about--

492
00:28:06,127 --> 00:28:09,483
- Fuck! Run!
- What's happening?

493
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:11,637
Fuck! The car's this way!

494
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:16,441
Would you stay away!
Son of a bitch!

495
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:20,918
- Doesn't he want to see me?
- Well, I felt so bad about San Diego,
I bent the rules a little bit.

496
00:28:21,007 --> 00:28:23,760
- Did you-- Did he-- Did you call them?
- Yes, I tried to!

497
00:28:23,847 --> 00:28:26,122
- His phone isn't working.
- What the fuck you people
talking about?

498
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:29,836
We just wanted to know if one of you
is Fritz Boudreau, because they said
he was my father.

499
00:28:29,927 --> 00:28:33,158
What did they say?
Who said I'm your father?

500
00:28:33,247 --> 00:28:36,319
- She did.
- The Maidstone Adoption Agency.

501
00:28:36,407 --> 00:28:39,444
Why, you little shit!
Look at this turd face, Mitch!

502
00:28:39,527 --> 00:28:42,724
This turd is my son.
I'm sorry, man. Did we scare you?

503
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:45,719
- Yeah, a little.
- A little bit.
- We were scared too.

504
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,924
How did we know? I dropped
a lot of baby batter in my day.

505
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:52,124
- This is the first son I ever met.
- Wow.
- What a wonderful moment.

506
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:55,802
- I wish I had my camera.
- You picked a hell of a time
to drop by, turd face.

507
00:28:55,887 --> 00:29:01,519
- Well, your phone wasn't working.
- Nah, I don't need no son to give me
no guilt trip about a phone.

508
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:04,519
Fritzie, Fritzie,
we gotta get goin', pal.

509
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:06,325
- Remember?
- Shit.
- What?

510
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:08,363
- Come on.
- Goin' somewhere?
- Yeah.

511
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:12,360
- Where do you have to go?
- We gotta get the wheels balanced
for a big trip tomorrow.

512
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:15,359
- Where you goin'?
- After Eugene balances the wheels...

513
00:29:15,447 --> 00:29:19,122
- we're gonna be out
for about three weeks.
- Three weeks? Really?
- Damn.

514
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:22,517
- Bad timing.
- Why don't we bring 'em along?

515
00:29:22,607 --> 00:29:25,724
Huh? You know, it's only
20 minutes over to Eugene's.

516
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:28,480
- Yeah. Come on with us.
- What? In the truck?

517
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:31,035
- Hey, you ever been in a truck before?
- No, not really.

518
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:37,601
How do you like this?
First time in a rig, huh?

519
00:29:37,687 --> 00:29:40,759
- It's great.
- It's really fabulous, Mr Boudreau.

520
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:43,839
Some people look down on drivers,
like we're low class.

521
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:46,964
Not me. I always wanted to learn
how to drive a big rig.

522
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:49,720
- You never told me that.
- Well, I might not have voiced it
until now...

523
00:29:49,807 --> 00:29:52,924
-but it's always been a fantasy of mine.
-You want a lesson?

524
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:55,157
- You'd give me a lesson?
- Sure! Why not?

525
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:57,363
Let's not do this
while the baby's in the truck.

526
00:29:57,447 --> 00:30:00,086
- Don't you trust me?
- Of course I trust you.

527
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:04,001
- But he's never done this before.
- She's not gonna let you drive
the truck, so forget about it.

528
00:30:04,087 --> 00:30:06,885
- Are you sayin' my son's a bitch boy?
- I didn't say that!

529
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:09,606
- What's your name again?
- Mel.

530
00:30:09,687 --> 00:30:11,757
You ain't no bitch boy,
are ya, Mel?

531
00:30:11,847 --> 00:30:14,486
No, I don't believe
I'm a bitch boy.

532
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:16,797
Don't let him bait you
into doing something stupid, Mel.

533
00:30:16,887 --> 00:30:18,798
Nancy, Mel needs your support now.

534
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:21,162
- Yeah, I need your support, honey.
- Yeah.

535
00:30:21,247 --> 00:30:23,283
- I support you, Mel.
- Me too!

536
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:26,723
I wanna get out.
You're acting like a real asshole.

537
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:28,718
Pussy-whipped.

538
00:30:37,807 --> 00:30:40,605
We're comin' back in 15 minutes.
What's the big deal?

539
00:30:40,687 --> 00:30:44,396
Hey! Get away!
Have a great trip, okay?

540
00:30:44,487 --> 00:30:48,924
- We'll be supporting you from out here.
May I have my baby, please?
- Nancy.

541
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:53,603
Just send us a postcard,
'cause we'll be right here
at the Gundall Post Office, okay?

542
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:57,123
This isn't gonna take long, honey.
Just calm down.

543
00:30:57,207 --> 00:31:00,836
So remember,
it's like a butterfly's wings.
Use a little gas, a little clutch.

544
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:03,487
- A little gas, a little clutch.
- A little gas, a little clutch.
What happens if I hit this?

545
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:08,766
- What does that do? Is that okay?
- You know somethin'? You got a--
You got a kind of Jew look, don't you?

546
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:12,237
Well, the people who raised me
are Jewish. Maybe that's
what you're picking up on.

547
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:14,522
They-They gave you
a real ''Hebe'' look, kid.

548
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:17,280
- Mitch, don't say that.
That's not nice.
- Wait a second. Wait--

549
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:21,838
No, it's not a Jew face. It's--
It's a face like Old Needledick's!

550
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:24,885
Yeah! You're not in some kind
of science, are you, kid?

551
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,037
Science? Actually,
I'm an entomologist.

552
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:29,197
-Entomologist sounds like science to me.
-Wait, wait, wait.

553
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,323
Who's-Who's Old Needledick?
What are you talking about?

554
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:34,956
When I met your mother, I was ridin'
with the Angels in Oakland, Cal.

555
00:31:35,047 --> 00:31:36,958
- Uh-huh. The Hell's Angels? Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

556
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:39,356
And we got invited
to all these fancy parties...

557
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:42,200
because rich people liked
to hang around with the Angels...

558
00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:44,755
and musical bands and whatnot.

559
00:31:44,847 --> 00:31:49,159
And your mother
meets this guy, Richard Schlich--

560
00:31:49,247 --> 00:31:52,478
- I can never pronounce
that cocksucker's name.
- Schlichling.

561
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:55,400
Okay, okay. So she meets this guy,
Richard Schlich-- Schlichling.

562
00:31:55,487 --> 00:31:58,923
-And what? What? They went off together?
-They ran off together...

563
00:31:59,007 --> 00:32:01,601
to Antelope Wells.

564
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:05,283
- You're saying--
- This can't be happening.

565
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:07,722
You're saying you're not sure
if you're my father?

566
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:10,844
- I'm sorry to disappoint you.
- But the records show...

567
00:32:10,927 --> 00:32:13,487
that-that you're the one
who brought him into the agency.

568
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:18,402
I did a good deed as a favour, because
his mother and father were indisposed.

569
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:21,206
- Indisposed how?
- You'll have to ask your mother
about that.

570
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:24,085
But we don't know where she is.
So isn't it possible...

571
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:26,362
that you got her pregnant
before she left you?

572
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:29,883
- No, no, no! With this face,
this science thing--
- Hey, we're movin' backwards here.

573
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:32,481
- Where's the brake? Do I--
- Put it in first.

574
00:32:35,207 --> 00:32:37,846
Oh, my God! Mel!

575
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:44,837
I don't think it's wrong
to want to take a driving lesson
with your father, right?

576
00:32:44,927 --> 00:32:47,646
- I'm not speaking to you.
- Sweetie, I'm sorry about this.

577
00:32:47,727 --> 00:32:50,764
Give me a kiss.
Sweetie, give me--

578
00:32:50,847 --> 00:32:53,600
- Hey, Mr Boudreau,
where is Antelope Wells?
- Please step off.

579
00:32:53,687 --> 00:32:56,326
- Sorry, do you know
where Antelope Wells is?
- I have no idea.Just--

580
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,717
She doesn't know
what the hell she's doing.
That man was a lunatic, a stranger!

581
00:32:59,807 --> 00:33:03,356
- Okay, okay.
- Mr Boudreau, please, before you go...

582
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:06,166
- Tommy, get her off me! Move!
-just tell me where Antelope Wells is.

583
00:33:06,247 --> 00:33:10,001
- When I say step off, I mean step off!
- Hey! I am from New York, okay?

584
00:33:10,087 --> 00:33:14,239
On the upside, Antelope Wells
should be warmer than this place.

585
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:17,364
So we're just gonna jump on a plane
to New Mexico? Is that it?

586
00:33:17,447 --> 00:33:20,598
Well, I think that we should finish
what we started.

587
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:23,927
Agent Paul Harmon,
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

588
00:33:24,007 --> 00:33:26,680
This is Agent Tony Kent.
Now let's see.

589
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:30,885
You, uh, you thought this
Fritz Boudreau was your father,
but, in fact, he's not your father.

590
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:34,118
- Well, no, I--
- Tony. Tony Kent.

591
00:33:34,207 --> 00:33:37,597
- Nancy Curwin.
- This is unbelievable!

592
00:33:37,687 --> 00:33:39,598
We went to high school
together in Chicago.

593
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:42,520
- You look fantastic!
- Now--
- No!

594
00:33:42,607 --> 00:33:45,041
- God!
- What are you doing in this police job?

595
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:48,085
Oh, I need a health plan
while I'm writing my first book.
What are you doing now?

596
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:50,362
- I'm curating.
- Excuse me. Excuse me. There's
something here we gotta take care of.

597
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:53,996
- Okay?
- I'm sorry, Paul. Go ahead.

598
00:33:54,087 --> 00:33:57,796
You do know it's a Federal offence
to destroy a United States post office.

599
00:33:57,887 --> 00:34:00,276
Well, it wasn't like it was
some premeditated act of terrorism.

600
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:02,278
- You know what I mean?
- I'll be the judge of that.

601
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:05,325
Now, the ostensible purpose
for this truck ride was what exactly?

602
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:07,398
He was giving me a lesson.
It was very simple.

603
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:10,843
- He just wanted to teach me
how to drive the truck.
- This baby is beautiful.

604
00:34:10,927 --> 00:34:12,963
- Thanks.
- Oh, gorgeous blue eyes.

605
00:34:13,047 --> 00:34:15,845
- Tony, Tony, Tony.
- You know, he looks a lot like you.

606
00:34:15,927 --> 00:34:18,316
- Tony. Tony.
- Thank you.
-Just-- In a minute.

607
00:34:18,407 --> 00:34:21,399
- Give the baby back.
- Hey, feel his little grip.
It's so strong.

608
00:34:21,487 --> 00:34:24,081
- Feel it.
-Jesus Christ!

609
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:26,522
- Hey.
- I'm s-- I'm--

610
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:29,485
- You're under way too much stress.
- Listen, this man drove a semi
into a Federal building.

611
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,001
You were gonna give him a warning.
It's an accident, remember.

612
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:35,079
- There's certain procedures
that you have to follow.
- Right. He's got a valid licence.

613
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:37,601
- Not to drive a truck! He does not!
- It was the trucker's fault...

614
00:34:37,687 --> 00:34:41,202
- for letting him drive
in the first place.
- All right, okay.
Can I talk with you in private?

615
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:52,403
This is my investigation.

616
00:34:52,487 --> 00:34:55,206
- I just said you didn't
have to suspend his licence.
- Here, I'll take the baby.

617
00:34:55,287 --> 00:34:58,836
- You gotta start taking the job--
- So what's the deal with this guy, huh?

618
00:34:58,927 --> 00:35:02,476
- We went to high school together.
- You just went to high school together?

619
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,525
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you know him well, or is it--

620
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:08,679
- He was on the football team.
- Oh, the football team. Oh.

621
00:35:08,767 --> 00:35:13,477
- It's not a murder.
It's-It's not a bank robbery.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

622
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:16,604
-Just cut the baby crap.
- Oh, all right. I'm sorry.

623
00:35:27,367 --> 00:35:30,279
So it looks like
this Boudreau fellow...

624
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:33,518
is gonna take the rap
for you driving the truck, so...

625
00:35:33,607 --> 00:35:35,996
I'm just gonna give you a warning.

626
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:39,718
But I'm-- If you--

627
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:43,766
If you drive a truck again, they're
gonna take your licence away for sure.

628
00:35:43,847 --> 00:35:44,916
- Okay.
- You understand?

629
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:47,726
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

630
00:35:48,567 --> 00:35:51,320
- Is that it? Are we free to go now?
- You are free to go, yes.

631
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:54,558
- Great. Let's get out of here.
- Uh, hey, do you guys
have a place to stay tonight?

632
00:35:54,647 --> 00:35:56,877
- Probably check into a motel.
- No, don't do that.

633
00:35:56,967 --> 00:36:00,243
- There's so many wonderful B-and-B's
right here in Lake Michigan.
- Oh, I hate B-and-B's.

634
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:03,956
-Why do you hate B-and-B's?
-Well, first of all, there's no privacy.

635
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:07,039
- No privacy. Uh-huh.
- Yeah. And you have to,
you have to make chitchat...

636
00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:10,085
- with the boring old lady
who runs the place--
- That's kind of the fun, isn't it?

637
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:13,000
Yeah, there's always the little cat,
little cat-- You have to pretend
like you like the cat.

638
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,920
Yeah, well, whatever we do, we need
to eat first, 'cause I'm starving.

639
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,396
- Why don't we take you out to dinner?
- Are we apologizing for the arrest?

640
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:20,398
No, but it would be nice
to catch up with Nancy.

641
00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:22,955
- We could take them to Minetti's.
- Minetti's is great...

642
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,607
- but you're not gonna get a reservation
this time of night at Minetti's.
- You know what? Thanks. Thanks anyway.

643
00:36:25,687 --> 00:36:28,884
- But we'll be fine, really.
- See? We don't want to intrude, Tony.

644
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:32,437
No, no, no, no, no. Don't be silly.
We're getting sick of each other's
company anyways.

645
00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:34,245
- Oh.
- You see? I told you.

646
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,961
- Hey, stop that!
- I can't believe you're a writer now.

647
00:36:38,047 --> 00:36:43,485
Well, an aspiring writer.
I'm trying to get this whole book
together, this crime fiction thing.

648
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:46,957
You were such a jock in high school.
You were so wild.

649
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:50,119
I know. And you were
such an egghead, remember?

650
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:52,516
- No.
- You were an egghead.
- No!

651
00:36:52,607 --> 00:36:55,758
- So what I'm asking is, you fly
into Albuquerque and then rent a car...
- We're going to Texas tomorrow.

652
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:59,203
- and how far--
- It's way down. Way down at the
southeastern corner of the state.

653
00:36:59,287 --> 00:37:02,085
- Wait. Excuse me.
Have you been there before?
- It's almost in Mexico, in fact.
I've been near there.

654
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:06,445
- Antelope Wells is right near
the White Sands National Monument.
- Uh-huh.

655
00:37:06,527 --> 00:37:10,122
They've got this fantastic,
uh, hot springs nearby
that not many people know about.

656
00:37:10,207 --> 00:37:14,041
Oh, I wish you could come along and show
me around while Mel meets his family.

657
00:37:14,127 --> 00:37:17,881
- You have the personal days.
You should do it, Paul.
- I can't take time off work right now.

658
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:20,435
- Unbelievable line at the bathroom!
- I told 'em they gotta get
a bigger bathroom.

659
00:37:20,527 --> 00:37:24,042
Look at him. He loves you.
You're wonderful with children.

660
00:37:24,127 --> 00:37:28,200
Oh, I want one of these
so badly. I'm telling you.

661
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:31,882
Hey, could you help me out
with an adoption, Tina?

662
00:37:32,687 --> 00:37:36,157
Well, that depends on the specifics
of your situation.

663
00:37:36,247 --> 00:37:39,717
- Well, like what?
- Number one: Are you married?

664
00:37:39,807 --> 00:37:41,923
- Yes.
- Number two: Does your spouse work?

665
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:45,841
- Yeah.
- And is she willing to adopt?
- You see, that's where the snag is.

666
00:37:45,927 --> 00:37:47,883
Then you've got a real problem.

667
00:37:49,527 --> 00:37:52,121
What would my chances be
as a single parent?

668
00:37:52,207 --> 00:37:55,358
- Excuse me, please.
- Why can't you stay and discuss this?

669
00:37:57,207 --> 00:38:00,722
- 'Cause I believe in privacy,
that's why.
- Right. We have nothing
to be ashamed of, though.

670
00:38:00,807 --> 00:38:04,038
Because I don't want
to share my personal life
with everybody I meet, okay?

671
00:38:04,127 --> 00:38:06,322
She's not just anyone.
She works in an adoption agency.

672
00:38:06,407 --> 00:38:09,843
I thought that she
could be helpful. God!

673
00:38:09,927 --> 00:38:14,478
You know, I keep telling him
that having a baby will reduce stress
by taking his mind off work...

674
00:38:14,567 --> 00:38:17,764
but he just--
he doesn't listen, you know?

675
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:20,919
So where did you folks come down
on the big circumcision controversy?

676
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,237
'Cause, you know, there's a movement
afoot these days to keep the foreskin...

677
00:38:23,327 --> 00:38:28,162
and, personally, I think a boy's penis
should look just like his father's.

678
00:38:28,247 --> 00:38:31,080
- You know?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
- Can I have the baby?

679
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:35,877
Oh, sure. Yeah.
Here we go. Oh, so cute.

680
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:47,606
My late husband devised
his own anti-erosion system...

681
00:38:47,687 --> 00:38:52,886
that later on we had patented
on the advice of a dear friend...

682
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:57,722
who was in a law office
with Gerald Ford.

683
00:38:57,807 --> 00:39:02,278
My brother has the same birthday
as President Ford...

684
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:05,598
who is a very sweet man.

685
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:07,962
We met him twice.

686
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:14,517
Once at a political rally
and once at a golf tournament.

687
00:39:14,607 --> 00:39:17,804
And his wife
is such a sweet lady.

688
00:39:17,887 --> 00:39:20,765
Betty Ford is so pretty.

689
00:39:20,847 --> 00:39:23,315
And why couldn't we go to a motel?

690
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:26,683
Because at a motel
we don't have the bonus...

691
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:32,000
of someone related
to Gerald Ford's birthday.

692
00:39:32,087 --> 00:39:35,636
We forgot your father's birthday.

693
00:39:35,727 --> 00:39:37,877
Oh, fuck.

694
00:39:42,487 --> 00:39:45,285
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.

695
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:47,517
So, how's the psychic healing going?

696
00:39:47,607 --> 00:39:50,075
I am really sorry we didn't
get back for Dad's birthday.

697
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:52,840
It's all right. We'll try it again
when he turns 65...

698
00:39:52,927 --> 00:39:55,441
provided he lives that long
and you're not too busy.

699
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:57,802
- I said I was sorry.
- Why are you whispering?

700
00:39:57,887 --> 00:40:01,004
- Because I'm not supposed
to be using this phone.
- Are you all right?

701
00:40:01,087 --> 00:40:03,203
We're fine. It's just--
There was a big mix-up in San Diego...

702
00:40:03,287 --> 00:40:05,960
and then I ended up flattening
a post office with a truck.

703
00:40:06,047 --> 00:40:08,686
- What truck?
- Truck? What's happening with a truck?

704
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:11,839
We had the wrong information.
But we have the right information now,
and we're going to New Mexico.

705
00:40:11,927 --> 00:40:14,600
- New Mexico?
- Tell him they got uranium
in the water down there.

706
00:40:14,687 --> 00:40:16,723
Shush. He's in
some kind of trouble.

707
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:18,843
- Did your car get bumped in San Diego?
- No!

708
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:21,487
I mean, yes, there was
a minor incident. Nothing--

709
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:25,685
No, no! We don't do this here,
unless it's an emergency.

710
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:27,883
- What's the emergency?
- Is it the baby?

711
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,527
-Oh, my God! What's wrong with the baby?
-The baby is fine.

712
00:40:30,607 --> 00:40:32,643
- Good. Then hang up.
- Do you need help?

713
00:40:32,727 --> 00:40:35,525
- Things aren't--
- Do you see this sign?
''No phone calls after 8:00 p.m.

714
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:39,282
- Use gas station at corner.''
- All right. Could I, could I
just have 30 seconds, please?

715
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:41,676
No. Do you want to pay
my phone bills?

716
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:43,678
- Thirty seconds.
- Hang up!

717
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:46,076
- Is that tyrant your mother?
- No. I have to go, all right?

718
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:48,840
- We're gonna be with the Schlichtings.
- The ''Shitkings''?

719
00:40:48,927 --> 00:40:52,158
- What kind of a name is Shitking?
- Schlichting. Schlichting.
They're my parents.

720
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:54,681
- What kind of a name is Shitking?
- Verboten means verboten!
- I don't know.

721
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:57,725
I think it's German.
We're gonna be in Antelope Wells.

722
00:40:58,967 --> 00:41:01,879
Hello? Mel?

723
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:05,765
- I used my calling card.
- That's not the point!

724
00:41:19,527 --> 00:41:22,087
I think something terrible
is happening to him.

725
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,601
- Calm down, calm down.
- I can't calm down!

726
00:41:24,687 --> 00:41:27,759
- What did he say?
- We have to do something.

727
00:41:27,847 --> 00:41:30,281
- All right, well, we'll call back.
- We can't call back.

728
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:33,200
He's on his way
to New Mexico, for God's sake!

729
00:41:33,287 --> 00:41:36,484
Who knows what kind of people he's with?
Anything is possible.

730
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:38,797
Don't say that!
You're starting to scare me.

731
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:41,162
- I am not. You were already scared.
- I was not!

732
00:41:41,247 --> 00:41:44,045
- Yes, you were.
- Eddie, we have to do something!

733
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:46,800
Like what?
There's nothing we can do.

734
00:41:47,447 --> 00:41:51,281
- The kitchen's off-limits after 8:00.
- What are you, her spy?

735
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:55,155
- Why didn't you use Tina's phone?
- 'Cause Tina's phone isn't working.

736
00:41:55,247 --> 00:41:58,478
You know, it's starting to feel like
this whole thing is a big waste of time.

737
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:04,000
- You're feeling frustrated.
- Yes, I'm feeling very frustrated.

738
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:06,726
I was worried your expectations
were too high for all of this.

739
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:10,356
- You know, maybe we should just
forget everything and go home.
- Don't do that.

740
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:13,723
You always get so pessimistic
when you're close to finishing
something you've started.

741
00:42:13,807 --> 00:42:16,002
- I do not.
- Yes, you do.
You did it with the apartment.

742
00:42:16,087 --> 00:42:20,046
You loved it so much. The day we go to
sign the lease, you start freaking out.

743
00:42:20,127 --> 00:42:23,881
And the wedding.
How many times did you change the date?

744
00:42:24,567 --> 00:42:26,762
You're right. You're right.
I do this all the time.

745
00:42:26,847 --> 00:42:29,122
So stick to your plan
for once, okay?

746
00:42:29,207 --> 00:42:32,005
If you want to find your parents,
find your parents.

747
00:42:37,407 --> 00:42:39,762
- Oh!
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

748
00:42:39,847 --> 00:42:44,477
- Are you okay? You seem upset.
- I owe you a big apology.

749
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:48,560
I mean, this was--
this is not the way I planned this trip,
not the way I wanted it to turn out.

750
00:42:48,647 --> 00:42:51,764
Look, look, it's been kind of difficult,
but I think we've gotten past the bumps.

751
00:42:51,847 --> 00:42:54,281
You know, I feel, I feel really good
about, about where we're going.

752
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:57,325
I really think it's gonna be great.

753
00:42:58,527 --> 00:43:01,644
You're such an optimist.
Where does that come from?

754
00:43:04,687 --> 00:43:08,077
Well, you know, I've always said it's
a mistake to let pessimism take over...

755
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:10,965
right before you're
about to finish something.

756
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:15,643
That's the complete
opposite of my ex-husband.
He was such a pessimistic pig.

757
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:20,879
Well, I think you're doing
a great job. Really.

758
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:23,117
- Really.
- Thanks.

759
00:43:23,207 --> 00:43:25,516
- Good night.
- Good night. Good night.

760
00:43:46,567 --> 00:43:48,478
Thanks.

761
00:43:50,367 --> 00:43:52,278
Shit.

762
00:44:02,127 --> 00:44:05,085
What was that noise?
Did you drop something?

763
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:09,126
Goddam cat flew out of nowhere.
Scared the hell out of me.

764
00:44:09,207 --> 00:44:11,960
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

765
00:44:12,047 --> 00:44:15,084
- Where'd you get the pup tent?
- I--

766
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:18,045
I'm feeling very sexual.
I don't know.

767
00:44:18,127 --> 00:44:20,197
I'm just feeling like I want to--

768
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:26,283
Wait. Let me just
take my glasses off.

769
00:44:27,647 --> 00:44:31,720
Wait a second. Wait, Mel!
Mel, look at me.

770
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:36,401
Just slow down for a second.
Let's take our time.

771
00:44:36,487 --> 00:44:38,876
- Look at me.
- Huh? Why?

772
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,197
- Why aren't you looking at me?
- What? What? I'm looking at you!

773
00:44:41,287 --> 00:44:44,882
- Why do I have to look at you? I mean--
- Well, why can't you look at me?

774
00:44:52,127 --> 00:44:54,925
I don't know.
I don't know what's going on.

775
00:44:55,007 --> 00:44:57,521
I mean, don't you ever think
that maybe it's not natural...

776
00:44:57,607 --> 00:44:59,643
for two people to be together
their entire lives?

777
00:44:59,727 --> 00:45:03,276
- Do you ever think that?
- Oh, I get it.

778
00:45:04,727 --> 00:45:06,922
Your parents
weren't good enough for you...

779
00:45:07,007 --> 00:45:11,842
and now I'm not good enough for you
because Tina's a skinny dancer, right?

780
00:45:11,927 --> 00:45:13,883
- No. What?
- You know, it takes some women...

781
00:45:13,967 --> 00:45:17,118
more than a year to get back to their
normal weight after having a baby.

782
00:45:17,207 --> 00:45:22,679
- You are not good B-and-B people!
- Yeah, well, that's because
we hate B-and-B's!

783
00:45:22,927 --> 00:45:26,044
- Thanks.
- Look, we need to talk.

784
00:45:26,127 --> 00:45:31,599
- Okay.
- I'm, I'm not sure I'm ready for
an affair with a married man right now.

785
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:35,566
I'm feeling just as confused as you are,
okay? About the whole thing, all right?

786
00:45:35,647 --> 00:45:38,081
I'm in the middle of a divorce.
I'm going to school at night.

787
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:40,317
You know, I need to be taken
seriously as a woman.

788
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:43,285
I want to have my own children.
I want to have my own life, you know?

789
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:47,246
Not just some sort of vicarious
semblance of like somebody else's life.

790
00:45:49,727 --> 00:45:52,241
Shit.

791
00:45:52,327 --> 00:45:54,238
- What's the matter with her?
- Hi.

792
00:45:54,327 --> 00:45:58,115
She's upset about the way everything's
going. She's really-- Yeah.

793
00:45:58,207 --> 00:46:01,995
Listen, I feel like I owe you
an apology about last night.

794
00:46:02,087 --> 00:46:04,203
- Okay.
- Well, I mean, I think
we should discuss it...

795
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,357
- because, you know,
there's two sides to everything.
- Hey, you guys!

796
00:46:06,447 --> 00:46:09,200
That doesn't sound
like an apology.

797
00:46:09,287 --> 00:46:11,278
What the hell?

798
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:13,403
- Hey!
- Hello again, strangers.

799
00:46:13,487 --> 00:46:17,162
- Hey. Hi.
- I'm sorry that I stormed out
like that last night.

800
00:46:17,247 --> 00:46:19,886
But I suffer from hypertension.
You probably already knew that.

801
00:46:19,967 --> 00:46:24,245
The whole thing was a blessing, really,
because it finally made Paul realize
how much he needs some R-and-R.

802
00:46:24,327 --> 00:46:27,364
- Sometimes you gotta be zonked
on the head. What can I say?
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

803
00:46:27,447 --> 00:46:30,086
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You guys are going to New Mexico?
- We're goin', yeah.

804
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:33,045
Nothing like a cruel acceptance
of a casual invitation, right?

805
00:46:33,127 --> 00:46:36,199
- Invitation? What invitation?
- I think you were in the bathroom.

806
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:39,199
- Oops. Did we jump the gun here?
- No, this'll be fine.

807
00:46:39,287 --> 00:46:41,403
No, wait. What do you mean
it's fine? It's fine?

808
00:46:41,487 --> 00:46:44,081
- We're sightseeing.
We're not gonna get in your way.
- I'm glad to have the company.

809
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:47,284
- It's gonna be fun.
- Look, we already checked in. Why don't
I find a row for the baby, okay?

810
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:49,278
- Terrific!
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Thanks.

811
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:51,881
- Bye.
- We'll see you on board, Mel.

812
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:54,879
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't expect them to show up, honey.

813
00:46:54,967 --> 00:46:58,004
- So what? You just had
a little extra hostility to work out?
- It isn't hostility.

814
00:46:58,087 --> 00:47:00,999
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- I just barely mentioned it to them.
- Right, great, great.
- Right?

815
00:47:01,087 --> 00:47:03,476
- Great, great.
- Right?
- Whatever, okay?

816
00:47:03,567 --> 00:47:06,798
I wasn't circumcised
until I was a year old.

817
00:47:06,887 --> 00:47:09,447
- Wow! Why?
- I had hypospadias.

818
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:13,725
- What is that?
- Here you are, sir.
- Well, hypospadias is like
a curvature of the penis that--

819
00:47:13,807 --> 00:47:16,196
- They have to adjust it
with a whole operation.
- Really?

820
00:47:16,287 --> 00:47:18,517
- Yeah. I had it done when I was young.
I mean, it's fine now.
- Oh, wow.

821
00:47:18,607 --> 00:47:22,202
- Here you go. Honey?
- What?
- Why don't you cover yourself, hmm?

822
00:47:22,287 --> 00:47:25,324
I just finished nursing him, okay?

823
00:47:27,767 --> 00:47:30,679
Ever heard of hypospadias?

824
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:33,486
Is there something wrong
with the plane?

825
00:47:35,487 --> 00:47:39,605
- How, how is the nipple irritation?
- It's really bad, actually.

826
00:47:39,687 --> 00:47:41,598
You know why?
'Cause I, I was watching you...

827
00:47:41,687 --> 00:47:45,316
and I think you might be holding him
at the wrong angle. Hey, I meant--

828
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:48,205
- I've been doing this for a while now.
- Oh, I know you have.

829
00:47:48,287 --> 00:47:51,916
But, but, you see, when he's under,
when he's under your breast like this...

830
00:47:52,007 --> 00:47:56,444
- Mm-hmm.
- and, see, he pulls down on the nipple
which obviously causes more irritation.

831
00:47:56,527 --> 00:48:00,361
- But if you're out here and bring him
straight into the breasts--
- Uh-huh.

832
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:05,521
- You know? I mean--
- How'd you get to be
such an expert on all this?

833
00:48:05,607 --> 00:48:08,121
- I went out with a woman
who was a midwife.
- Really?

834
00:48:08,207 --> 00:48:11,517
- Yeah. You have very beautiful
breasts, by the way.
- Thank you.

835
00:48:11,607 --> 00:48:13,518
I re--
I remember them from high school.

836
00:48:13,607 --> 00:48:16,565
- Do you?
- Yeah. No, not that I was
like looking at them...

837
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:18,797
but, I mean,
I just saw them in passing.

838
00:48:18,887 --> 00:48:22,118
- Hey, Paul?
- Yes, here.
- Do you mind finding another seat?

839
00:48:22,207 --> 00:48:26,758
- I won't look.
- No, no, no, no. We need it
for the baby to stretch out.

840
00:48:26,847 --> 00:48:29,759
- It would really help us out.
- Oh. Another seat, huh?

841
00:48:29,847 --> 00:48:32,122
- Yeah.
- Oh, ok-- Yeah.

842
00:48:32,207 --> 00:48:35,563
- Yeah? Great.
- Thanks a million. Thanks.
- No, that's--

843
00:48:35,647 --> 00:48:37,797
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- All right.

844
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,879
- Hey, thanks for the water.
- Yeah.
- That's the headache pressure point.

845
00:48:40,967 --> 00:48:44,403
- Mmm.
- Can you feel it?
- Yeah.

846
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:48,082
Is there something happening here
that I haven't been clued into yet?

847
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:51,364
Paul, would you mind
finding another seat?

848
00:48:51,447 --> 00:48:55,838
This is wonderful. This is great.
I just-- I can't believe how naive I am.

849
00:48:55,927 --> 00:48:58,885
Sir, I can't have you moving around.
Please sit in your assigned seat, okay?

850
00:48:58,967 --> 00:49:02,642
Okay, okay.
Is anybody sitting here?

851
00:49:02,727 --> 00:49:06,037
Does anybody actually own a white
Taurus, or are they all just rentals?

852
00:49:06,127 --> 00:49:09,642
Are you kidding me? This is
the most reliable mid-size in America,
according to all the big reports.

853
00:49:09,727 --> 00:49:12,525
I'm feeling very depressed,
and I would like to talk about
what's happening here.

854
00:49:12,607 --> 00:49:15,838
- What are you feeling depressed about?
- I feel like there's an agenda
and it's not what I had in mind.

855
00:49:15,927 --> 00:49:18,805
- What agenda?
- Well, do I have to spell it out?
I'm the fifth wheel here.

856
00:49:18,887 --> 00:49:22,436
- How do you think that makes me feel?
- We're riding in two cars until we get
to the B-and-B, Paul.

857
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:25,087
- That's not an agenda.
- Let's just hit the road, okay?

858
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:27,761
You don't mind
if he rides with you, right?

859
00:49:27,847 --> 00:49:30,566
- Why can't he ride with you?
- See what you're doing to me?

860
00:49:30,647 --> 00:49:34,322
- Ride with us.
I don't care. Ride with us.
- Oh, that's so generous of you, Tony.

861
00:49:34,407 --> 00:49:37,126
You know, I think I'll ride
with illicit couple number two.

862
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:42,879
Oh, no. He does this to me
every eight months.

863
00:49:42,967 --> 00:49:46,357
-I ought to get used to it by now, but--
-What? What does he do?

864
00:49:46,447 --> 00:49:49,439
He gets antsy and he runs off
with somebody else.

865
00:49:49,527 --> 00:49:52,758
Well, I think that that's common,
you know, among certain types
of married men.

866
00:49:52,847 --> 00:49:55,077
I'm the rock, he's the flake.
So that's life.

867
00:49:55,167 --> 00:49:59,285
That's exactly what my ex-husband
used to say when he was trying
to feel superior to me.

868
00:49:59,367 --> 00:50:01,437
- Tony's flights of terror
from his own life...
- Ex.

869
00:50:01,527 --> 00:50:03,438
have nothing to do
with my superiority.

870
00:50:03,527 --> 00:50:05,882
- Well, it's not terror
that makes people wander.
- I know.

871
00:50:05,967 --> 00:50:10,358
- It's vitality.
- I see. Is it vitality that led Mel
to leave his wife for you?

872
00:50:10,447 --> 00:50:12,961
- Paul, would you mind
riding in the other car?
- I don't know. I don't mind.

873
00:50:13,047 --> 00:50:15,322
- Good. Could we just pull over here?
- Yeah. I think--

874
00:50:15,407 --> 00:50:17,557
So what happened
in the other car anyway?

875
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,115
Oh, Paul was probably
lecturing them, right?

876
00:50:20,207 --> 00:50:23,517
No, I wasn't lecturing them.
I was asking questions. That's all.
I wasn't lecturing.

877
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:25,802
Oh, my God. Is that--
You brought your gun.

878
00:50:25,887 --> 00:50:28,606
Absolutely I brought it. You never--
You get beeped for an emergency.

879
00:50:28,687 --> 00:50:31,724
You know, you're such
a hopeless workaholic.
We're on vacation, for God's sake.

880
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,560
- Oh, yeah, such a good time.
- No, Mel's like that too.
He cannot enjoy anything.
- You know, if you--

881
00:50:34,647 --> 00:50:38,276
If you can't commit
to our marriage now, what are you
gonna do when we have a baby? Huh?

882
00:50:42,652 --> 00:50:45,120
Why can't he ride with you, huh? Hey,
you invited them in the first place.

883
00:50:45,212 --> 00:50:47,601
- Could you pass me the Baby Wipes?
- Where are you going?

884
00:50:47,692 --> 00:50:50,365
- To pee.
- You're just gonna-- Right here?

885
00:50:50,452 --> 00:50:53,683
You're just gonna squat?

886
00:50:55,972 --> 00:50:59,601
- Why do you have to take your keys
with you to pee anyway?
- I just wasn't thinking, okay?

887
00:50:59,692 --> 00:51:01,887
It's-- I don't know how many times
I've told you to keep your keys...

888
00:51:01,972 --> 00:51:04,691
- in one place.
-Just shut up! Fuck.

889
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:19,490
Nancy was saying you guys were having
some tension around oral sex?

890
00:51:19,572 --> 00:51:21,210
- Oh, was she?
- Yeah.
- Really?

891
00:51:21,292 --> 00:51:23,522
- Yeah. Uh-- Hey.
- Oh.
- It happens to me too, but...

892
00:51:23,612 --> 00:51:27,321
you know, a technique that I find
useful-- humming to myself.

893
00:51:27,412 --> 00:51:29,323
- Humming to yourself?
- Yep, humming.
- Really?

894
00:51:29,412 --> 00:51:32,290
- Seems to release the tension so I
can enjoy the fellatio. It's great.
- Great. Great.

895
00:51:32,372 --> 00:51:34,567
- Thank you. Thanks for the tip.
- You bet.
- All right.

896
00:51:34,652 --> 00:51:37,450
Do you worry about the risk factor
involved in gay sex?

897
00:51:37,532 --> 00:51:40,968
You know, it may be news to you, but
not every gay man has, uh, anal sex.

898
00:51:41,052 --> 00:51:42,963
That's where a lot
of the HIV risk lies.

899
00:51:43,052 --> 00:51:46,010
For example, I'm very anal. Uh, I--
I mean, in, uh, in the sense...

900
00:51:46,092 --> 00:51:49,402
that I'm compulsively careful
and clean about what touches my body.

901
00:51:49,492 --> 00:51:52,802
- Not into penetration, at all.
- To a fault.

902
00:51:52,892 --> 00:51:55,406
- Okay, do we have to talk
about this right now?
- Well, why not?

903
00:51:55,492 --> 00:51:57,687
- Are you a homophobic?
- No, I--
- I think it's interesting.

904
00:51:57,772 --> 00:51:59,728
- Really? Well, I think maybe--
maybe we shouldn't.
- No, I think it's very-- Oh, God.
- Well-- Uh, no-- Uh--

905
00:51:59,812 --> 00:52:03,487
- Nancy's just testing the risk
factor for sex with Tony, Mel.
- How primeval. What?

906
00:52:03,572 --> 00:52:06,086
- Paul, don't patronize her.
- I'm not patronizing her.

907
00:52:06,172 --> 00:52:08,208
She knows that I came of age
in the era of AIDS...

908
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:11,887
and even though I'm bisexual
I've been incredibly careful, okay?

909
00:52:11,972 --> 00:52:15,009
- Tested negative three times
in the last seven months.
- Really?

910
00:52:15,092 --> 00:52:17,560
- If I remember correctly.
Yeah, three times.
- What does that mean?

911
00:52:26,492 --> 00:52:29,928
I'm sorry. Uh, maybe we should've
sprung for an updated edition, huh?

912
00:52:30,012 --> 00:52:33,527
Hmm. I mean, uh, the picture's
right here. It was a nice B-and-B.

913
00:52:33,612 --> 00:52:37,810
Yeah, they probably had something
about the uranium contamination
in the new edition. Yeah.

914
00:52:37,892 --> 00:52:40,850
Did it ever occur to you
to call first? Or--

915
00:52:40,932 --> 00:52:43,890
Without spontaneity, the world
of B-and-B's is fairly meaningless.

916
00:52:43,972 --> 00:52:47,169
Oh. Well, then, I hope you have
a tent because that's the only way
that you can be spontaneous...

917
00:52:47,252 --> 00:52:48,765
in the middle of the desert
at this hour.

918
00:52:48,852 --> 00:52:51,127
Maybe Mel's parents
can suggest a place.

919
00:52:51,212 --> 00:52:53,123
Oh, right, I'm just going to,
uh, show up with 50 people.

920
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,521
''Hi. I haven't seen you for
about 30 years. This is my posse.

921
00:52:55,612 --> 00:52:57,807
And, by the way, Nancy invited along
these two gay guys just for fun...

922
00:52:57,892 --> 00:52:59,803
and, you know, we're gonna
be here for a while.''

923
00:52:59,892 --> 00:53:02,087
Wh-Wh-What does gay guys
have to do with anything?

924
00:53:02,172 --> 00:53:04,527
Nothing. It has nothing
to do with anything, okay?
I didn't mean to be insulting.

925
00:53:04,612 --> 00:53:06,728
Then why'd you say it, neurotic guy?

926
00:53:08,412 --> 00:53:10,926
- Th-That's my designation?
I'm ''neurotic guy''?
- Mm-hmm.

927
00:53:11,012 --> 00:53:13,526
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
- Yeah.
- I don't think you know me well
enough to call me ''neurotic guy.''

928
00:53:13,612 --> 00:53:15,682
Oh, really?
''Gay guy'' isn't intimate?

929
00:53:15,772 --> 00:53:18,411
- Look, do you wanna file
an anti-defamation suit...
- There's no intimacy happening here.

930
00:53:18,492 --> 00:53:20,403
or do you want to get to the
''Schwingkings''' before midnight? Okay?

931
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:23,211
Is this another surprise visit,
or did you call first this time?

932
00:53:23,292 --> 00:53:26,921
- You know, I spoke with them
already. I told you that, Nancy.
- What? What?

933
00:53:27,012 --> 00:53:29,367
- What?
- What, do you want to get intimate?
Is that what you're saying?

934
00:53:29,452 --> 00:53:31,602
- Hey, the baby's going to sleep.
- Huh? No?

935
00:53:36,612 --> 00:53:40,571
- You hear that?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Lend me your comb

936
00:53:40,652 --> 00:53:43,291
It's time to go home

937
00:53:43,372 --> 00:53:46,011
Gotta confess

938
00:53:46,092 --> 00:53:48,401
My hair is a mess

939
00:53:50,012 --> 00:53:53,243
Your mama will scold you

940
00:53:53,332 --> 00:53:55,892
Your daddy will shout

941
00:53:55,972 --> 00:53:58,566
As we come in

942
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:01,371
The way we went out

943
00:54:03,132 --> 00:54:06,522
Kissin'you was fun
Honey bun

944
00:54:06,612 --> 00:54:09,331
Thanks for the date

945
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,529
Time has come
Honey, honey bun

946
00:54:12,612 --> 00:54:15,809
You know, baby, it's a-gettin'late

947
00:54:15,892 --> 00:54:18,804
Just wait till I

948
00:54:18,892 --> 00:54:20,928
Straighten my tie

949
00:54:21,012 --> 00:54:23,526
Lend me your comb

950
00:54:23,612 --> 00:54:26,206
We've got to go home

951
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:30,808
- This is a long porch.
- It's a beautiful house, though.

952
00:54:35,092 --> 00:54:37,731
- Sorry.
- Do you think you can wait
back in the car?

953
00:54:37,812 --> 00:54:39,803
- Gotta go to the bathroom.
- Hi!
- Hi!

954
00:54:39,892 --> 00:54:42,486
- It's so late. We were
getting worried about you.
- I hope my directions were all right.

955
00:54:42,572 --> 00:54:46,247
- Oh, they were great.
This place is so isolated.
- Oh, that's what we love about it too.

956
00:54:46,332 --> 00:54:48,527
- I'm Tina Kalb.
We spoke on the phone.
- Tina.

957
00:54:48,612 --> 00:54:50,603
- Oh, yeah, right. Hi. Oh.
- We were shocked to get
your call yesterday.

958
00:54:50,692 --> 00:54:54,605
- Yeah. I'm, I'm just amazed
that you ran into Fritz Boudreau
after all these years.
- Nice to meet you.

959
00:54:54,692 --> 00:54:59,208
- He's something.
- Yeah. Well, he never got over
the fact that Mary left him for me.

960
00:54:59,292 --> 00:55:01,522
Which one of you is Mel?

961
00:55:01,612 --> 00:55:03,921
That's me.

962
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:07,448
- Mary Schlichting.
- Oh, so that's how you pronounce it.
- Oh!

963
00:55:07,532 --> 00:55:10,171
- Nobody ever gets it right. Hi.
- Hi.
- And this must be your wife.

964
00:55:10,252 --> 00:55:13,767
- Nancy.
- Nancy, hi. Welcome to our family.
- Hi. Look at the baby.

965
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,605
- Well, he's sleeping.
- These are our friends.

966
00:55:16,692 --> 00:55:19,206
- Uh, Tony and Paul.
- Tony.
- Paul. Mr Schlichting.

967
00:55:19,292 --> 00:55:21,487
- Hello, uh, Paul. Hi.
Hello. How you doing?
- I'm Tony.

968
00:55:21,572 --> 00:55:23,528
They were going to stay
at Rancho Arroyo.

969
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:27,730
- Oh, my goodness. You can't stay there.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, no. They, they
found that-- We read about that.

970
00:55:27,812 --> 00:55:29,928
- Uranium, yeah.
- Uranium, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Highly toxic.

971
00:55:30,012 --> 00:55:32,287
Thank God that's far away from here.
You don't have to worry about that.

972
00:55:32,372 --> 00:55:35,330
- Well, could you recommend a motel?
- Oh, no! No, no, no.
- Oh, no need to go to a motel.

973
00:55:35,412 --> 00:55:39,041
- There isn't a decent motel
for a hundred miles.
- And we have plenty of room
here for all of you.

974
00:55:39,132 --> 00:55:40,724
- Oh, thank you.
- Great.
- Sure, sure.

975
00:55:40,812 --> 00:55:44,122
- I-I-I don't want everyone
to stay here with you. It's--
- Why can't everyone stay here?

976
00:55:44,212 --> 00:55:47,682
- Because this is a private thing.
- You know, if I could just lay down.
I'd like to go right to bed
and put the baby to sleep.

977
00:55:47,772 --> 00:55:50,684
Sure. Let me help you. Don't you want
to eat something before you--

978
00:55:50,772 --> 00:55:55,084
- No. Thanks. I'm not hungry.
- Nancy, come on. You're always hungry.

979
00:55:55,172 --> 00:55:58,084
- Fuck you.
- What? I'm, I'm sorry?

980
00:55:58,172 --> 00:56:00,561
It's just-- You know, this isn't
the time or the place for this, okay?

981
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:03,644
Oh, but it was the time and place
to wrestle with her...

982
00:56:03,732 --> 00:56:06,200
in San Diego, right, and break
a bunch of glass animals?

983
00:56:06,292 --> 00:56:09,409
That's i-- That's fine?
That was a perfect time?

984
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:13,804
-I'm sorry, is this inappropriate?
-Nothing in this house is inappropriate.
We'll be upstairs.

985
00:56:13,892 --> 00:56:17,202
You know, I-I'll get the, the bags.
I think I want to lay down too.

986
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:20,090
I bet you would.

987
00:56:20,172 --> 00:56:23,687
- Hmm. Hmm.
- Having some problems, huh?

988
00:56:23,772 --> 00:56:26,286
Yeah, we're kind of having
a little bit of a--

989
00:56:26,372 --> 00:56:29,489
- Yeah. It's, uh--
- This, uh, some kind of
a swapping thing you got here?

990
00:56:29,572 --> 00:56:33,008
- That what it is?
- No. No, no, no, no.Just, you know,
there's a little friction, that's all.

991
00:56:33,092 --> 00:56:36,050
- I mean, you know--
- And then, and, and
these guys came along with us.
- Well, you know, you know--

992
00:56:36,132 --> 00:56:40,011
- You know, marriage is tough.
You just got-- You gotta be
flexible in marriage, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

993
00:56:40,092 --> 00:56:42,526
- This thing is wonderful,
by the way. Who made this?
- That's my work.

994
00:56:42,612 --> 00:56:44,284
- Really? You did this? Wow.
- Yeah.

995
00:56:44,372 --> 00:56:47,091
- Yeah, I got a blacksmith shop
out in the barn, and I do
my sculptures there...
- Oh.

996
00:56:47,172 --> 00:56:49,402
- and Mary throws her pots.
- Great.

997
00:56:49,492 --> 00:56:53,007
- Really? She's into,
into pottery? Pottery?
- Oh, she's gonna love showing you
her pottery. Yeah, look at this.

998
00:56:53,092 --> 00:56:56,129
- See, this, this is slab construction.
If you can see the--
- Yeah.

999
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:58,772
Uh, when I roll it out, then I have
weeds in with the rolling pin.

1000
00:56:58,852 --> 00:57:01,366
- I press them right into the surface.
- You know, just ordinary weeds.
- You put the weeds in the clay, yeah.

1001
00:57:01,452 --> 00:57:03,761
And then when you fire it, the weed--
the weeds burn off. Here, just stick--

1002
00:57:03,852 --> 00:57:06,241
- See, so where
the weeds were, you get the--
- Stick your fingers in here, you know.

1003
00:57:06,332 --> 00:57:08,892
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah--
- Now, stick two fingers inside...

1004
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:11,088
- and just caress the-- That's it. Now--
- Oh, okay. There you go. Yeah.

1005
00:57:11,172 --> 00:57:14,687
- Uh-huh. Now feel the texture
on the out-- No, against your face.
- Yeah, so it's much-- Up here.

1006
00:57:14,772 --> 00:57:16,683
- That texture is--
- Oh, it's kind of--
Yeah, it's very rough.

1007
00:57:16,772 --> 00:57:18,683
- That texture is really amazing.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's great.
- It looks rough...

1008
00:57:18,772 --> 00:57:20,888
- but it's very smooth, isn't it?
- Doesn't that feel good?
Isn't it something?
- Right, right, it's smooth.

1009
00:57:20,972 --> 00:57:23,202
- Smoother than you would think,
but, but still, still really--
- Yeah.

1010
00:57:23,292 --> 00:57:26,921
This is wonderful. Great stu--
I mean, and you guys, you guys are
making a living through the arts, huh?

1011
00:57:27,012 --> 00:57:29,321
- Well, we try. We--
Sometimes you have to supplement.
- We try to, but, you know, sometimes--

1012
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:32,051
- Yeah, you have to supplement
with other things.
- These are all mine.

1013
00:57:32,132 --> 00:57:35,568
Every one of them, I made-- Oh, let--
I want to show you a big one I love.

1014
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,768
This environment is so much more
creative than the one I grew up in.

1015
00:57:37,852 --> 00:57:41,208
- Oh, thanks. That's nice.
- It's really--
- This is a wood fire process.

1016
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:43,681
- Uh-huh. Uh, is this--
- See how this-- Hmm?

1017
00:57:43,772 --> 00:57:47,401
- Who's that?
- That's our other son.

1018
00:57:47,492 --> 00:57:50,290
- You mean I have a brother?
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- You wanna say hello to Lonnie?

1019
00:57:50,372 --> 00:57:54,001
- Yes. He's been feeling a little
threatened about meeting you,
so be patient.
- Uh-huh.

1020
00:57:54,092 --> 00:57:58,005
Hi. How you doing? That's
a beautiful song you're playing there.

1021
00:58:00,212 --> 00:58:04,444
- Is supper almost ready? Lonnie?
- Yeah, we better--
We better go in and, and eat.

1022
00:58:04,532 --> 00:58:07,968
He's been cooking all day.
Bagged the quail himself this morning.

1023
00:58:08,052 --> 00:58:10,486
Ooh, wild quail. That's terrific.

1024
00:58:10,572 --> 00:58:12,881
Oh, you're in for a great treat.
Lonnie's a really good cook.

1025
00:58:16,052 --> 00:58:20,921
Ooh, the special son
is here tonight

1026
00:58:21,012 --> 00:58:23,003
Little Cinderella oughta cook up

1027
00:58:23,092 --> 00:58:26,368
Something special for him

1028
00:58:26,452 --> 00:58:28,363
Lonnie, can you make

1029
00:58:28,452 --> 00:58:31,967
Your quail tonight

1030
00:58:34,412 --> 00:58:36,448
Okay.

1031
00:58:37,772 --> 00:58:40,161
You know-- You know what I want,
I want to have happen? I want Mel--

1032
00:58:40,252 --> 00:58:42,561
I want you to sit over there
next to your father.

1033
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:44,370
- Oh, it's okay.
- Oh, it's no problem.

1034
00:58:44,452 --> 00:58:46,647
Then I have all three
of my fellows in a row.

1035
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:48,609
All right. Come on.
Come on. Come around.

1036
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:51,286
- Um, maybe you should take
your, your plate with you.
- You don't mind, do you, Paul?
- That's all right. I didn't touch it.

1037
00:58:51,372 --> 00:58:53,806
Come on, come on. Sit down.
You like quail?

1038
00:58:53,892 --> 00:58:56,850
- See?
- No, I never had quail.
- Where are you?

1039
00:58:56,932 --> 00:58:59,207
You all right?

1040
00:58:59,292 --> 00:59:01,283
- I just don't wanna talk about it.
I need to calm down.
- All right.

1041
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:04,011
Well, if you do wanna talk about it,
you know, I, I wanna be here for you.

1042
00:59:04,092 --> 00:59:06,606
- Thank you.
- Want me to take care of the baby?

1043
00:59:06,692 --> 00:59:09,604
He's fine. He's sleeping.

1044
00:59:09,692 --> 00:59:13,685
- Um, do you mind if I take a shower?
- No, I don't care, but could I--

1045
00:59:13,772 --> 00:59:16,081
- Could I just have a second?
- Okay.

1046
00:59:16,612 --> 00:59:19,410
So, um, Fritz said you were
a scientist, Richard.

1047
00:59:19,492 --> 00:59:23,531
Yeah, I was a-- I was a chemist
for Maple Brothers in the Bay Area
before we came out here.

1048
00:59:23,612 --> 00:59:25,887
- Right, the aspirin company.
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

1049
00:59:25,972 --> 00:59:30,250
Decongestants, nasal sprays, all that,
uh, you know, that consumer crap.
I couldn't wait to quit.

1050
00:59:30,332 --> 00:59:32,800
- Oh, he hated it.
- Mm-hmm. I'm a scientist too.

1051
00:59:32,892 --> 00:59:34,325
- No, you're kidding!
- Yeah.
- Oh, you're kidding!

1052
00:59:34,412 --> 00:59:36,926
- Oh, my God! What are you--
What's, what's your specialty?
What, what's your field?
- Entomology.

1053
00:59:37,012 --> 00:59:38,923
- No! Isn't that incredible?
- I love it.
- Yeah.

1054
00:59:39,012 --> 00:59:42,925
- A genetic connection!
- Yeah. See, that is wonderful.
- Oh, my God! That's incredible!

1055
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:46,209
- That is wonderful.
- Oh, that's amazing.
- For some reason, Lonnie never seemed
to have an interest in science.

1056
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:49,204
- Mm, what does that mean?
- Hey, she doesn't mean anything.

1057
00:59:49,292 --> 00:59:53,331
It means something that you never
had-- an interest in science.
Look at the other things you do.

1058
00:59:53,412 --> 00:59:56,370
Yeah, well, who knows? I might
have had an interest in sculpture
if these guys didn't give me away.

1059
00:59:56,452 --> 00:59:58,363
- Yeah, who knows
what might have happened?
- Yeah, I know.

1060
00:59:58,452 --> 01:00:02,331
- Give me a kiss.
- Yeah, wh-wh-wh-what did happen?

1061
01:00:02,412 --> 01:00:06,610
- About what?
- Well, why did you guys give me up?

1062
01:00:06,692 --> 01:00:08,808
Why did we give him away?

1063
01:00:08,892 --> 01:00:10,883
- The big question.
- That's the question.

1064
01:00:10,972 --> 01:00:13,008
Well, Fritz Boudreau said
that you were indisposed...

1065
01:00:13,092 --> 01:00:15,526
and so that's how he came
to bring Mel to the agency.

1066
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,728
- ''Indisposed''? Is that what he said?
- Yeah, indisp--

1067
01:00:17,812 --> 01:00:21,043
- That's the word Fritz used?
- That's-- That would have been nice.
- Big word for the fellow, huh?

1068
01:00:21,132 --> 01:00:24,204
- I wouldn't mind being indisposed.
- Okay, I'm gonna tell the story.

1069
01:00:24,292 --> 01:00:28,604
Um, how, how much detail
do you have to go into here?

1070
01:00:28,692 --> 01:00:31,411
I want Mel to know what happened, or
he'll never believe we cared about him.

1071
01:00:31,492 --> 01:00:34,802
- What are you hanging onto that for?
- You're holding onto it.

1072
01:00:34,892 --> 01:00:37,884
- I'm not holding onto anything.
- I'm letting it go.
- Uh, you're holding onto these things.

1073
01:00:37,972 --> 01:00:40,088
Uh, tell him. Go ahead, tell him.
I don't care. Go ahead.

1074
01:00:40,172 --> 01:00:43,608
So, Mel, you know we were
living in San Francisco,
and it was the mid '60s, right?

1075
01:00:43,692 --> 01:00:47,401
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- And we were part of a very
progressive group of artists...

1076
01:00:47,492 --> 01:00:52,008
- and there was one band
at the centre of it.
- A band? Wh-Wh-What band?

1077
01:00:52,092 --> 01:00:54,925
Jerry Garcia, blah, blah, blah.

1078
01:00:55,012 --> 01:00:57,606
I am so sick of this fucking story!

1079
01:00:57,692 --> 01:01:01,002
It's so boring! You've been
telling it for years! Give it up!

1080
01:01:06,492 --> 01:01:09,086
- He doesn't like it
when I tell this story.
- What happened with Jerry Garcia?

1081
01:01:09,172 --> 01:01:12,005
- Nothing.
- Nothing happened with Jerry Garcia,
but Richard and I went to prison--

1082
01:01:12,092 --> 01:01:14,481
-Right-- Right after you were born.
-And that's why we had to give you away.

1083
01:01:14,572 --> 01:01:17,962
- You went to prison?
- Oh, don't be stigmatized by it.

1084
01:01:18,052 --> 01:01:20,168
- It wasn't a serious crime.
- Oh, God, it was nothing.

1085
01:01:20,252 --> 01:01:22,561
- Not even a crime.
- It was absolutely nothing.

1086
01:01:22,652 --> 01:01:24,768
- Next to nothing, really.
- Less than nothing. Have you
ever, you know, like, driven...

1087
01:01:24,852 --> 01:01:27,161
a few miles over the speed limit,
or something like that?

1088
01:01:27,252 --> 01:01:29,368
- Yeah, sure.
- It was less than that.

1089
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:31,488
If you speed, y-you know,
you could hurt somebody.

1090
01:01:31,572 --> 01:01:33,563
- This is--
- So, were you-- you
were jailed for driving?

1091
01:01:33,652 --> 01:01:36,610
- No, no, no. No, there
was no driving. I tried--
- How did they get that?

1092
01:01:36,692 --> 01:01:39,809
I'm, I'm, I'm, uh--
I'm sorry, I'm totally lost here.

1093
01:01:45,812 --> 01:01:47,882
- Hi.
- Hi.

1094
01:01:47,972 --> 01:01:50,202
- Here, I'll get out of your way. Aah!
- Ooh.

1095
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:52,487
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I don't know. What did I do?

1096
01:01:52,572 --> 01:01:55,006
- Oh, no, no. It's okay. Relax. Relax.
- No, watch out. You--

1097
01:01:55,092 --> 01:01:57,731
- I-- You could hurt your fingers.
- Watch how you--

1098
01:01:57,812 --> 01:02:00,406
- Whoops.
- Sh--

1099
01:02:00,492 --> 01:02:02,801
- I'm so clumsy.
- No, you're not.

1100
01:02:02,892 --> 01:02:05,008
You know, I have these,
uh, these, these--

1101
01:02:05,092 --> 01:02:07,560
- three Italian prints
at home that I keep, uh--
- Mm-hmm.

1102
01:02:07,652 --> 01:02:09,563
I don't know what to do--
if I should frame them myself...

1103
01:02:09,652 --> 01:02:12,530
- or maybe I should
take them to somebody else.
- I, uh-- I would-- I would
take them to the framer.

1104
01:02:12,612 --> 01:02:14,921
- Yeah?
- Yeah, well--

1105
01:02:15,012 --> 01:02:18,129
- So maybe that's what I'll do.
I think that-- Yeah.
- Do you want to take a shower?

1106
01:02:18,212 --> 01:02:21,921
- No, go ahead.
- No, I mean together?

1107
01:02:22,012 --> 01:02:26,608
Your husband's been taking you for
granted a little bit, don't you think?

1108
01:02:26,692 --> 01:02:29,684
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1109
01:02:29,772 --> 01:02:32,002
Here. Let me go get
my shower cap.

1110
01:02:32,092 --> 01:02:34,811
- You made LSD? Is that--
That's what you're saying?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah, but--

1111
01:02:34,892 --> 01:02:38,680
- We made LSD.
- Yes, yes. We made acid.
- And we gave it out
to people who needed it.

1112
01:02:38,772 --> 01:02:42,128
You know that there are
hundreds of pharmaceutical
executives in this country...

1113
01:02:42,212 --> 01:02:46,046
- Oh!
- that are selling drugs,
FDA approved drugs?

1114
01:02:46,132 --> 01:02:49,886
- Oh!
- On the open market.
- Oh, on the-- Over the counter
with incredible side--

1115
01:02:49,972 --> 01:02:51,963
- Horrible side effects.
- Terrible side effects.

1116
01:02:52,052 --> 01:02:53,963
- And these people are not in jail.
- They're not in prison anywhere.

1117
01:02:54,052 --> 01:02:56,691
They're, they're, they're in
country clubs or playing golf.
They're having drinks.

1118
01:02:56,772 --> 01:02:58,683
- They're running the country.
- They're not--
- They're running the country, Mel.

1119
01:02:58,772 --> 01:03:01,923
- Y-You know, LSD shouldn't be
a felony in the first place.
- It's not addictive.

1120
01:03:02,012 --> 01:03:04,003
- It doesn't lead to violent crime.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1121
01:03:04,092 --> 01:03:06,652
- It's really the only hope
for the species.
- Yeah.

1122
01:03:06,732 --> 01:03:08,962
D-Did you take acid while
you were pregnant with me?

1123
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:11,088
You're not gonna bring
that thing up, are you?

1124
01:03:11,172 --> 01:03:13,970
You know the stuff
they tell you about, you know,
chromosome damage and all that stuff?

1125
01:03:14,052 --> 01:03:16,168
- Yeah, I do!
- That's government propaganda.

1126
01:03:16,252 --> 01:03:19,210
- Total propaganda.
- They just want to get a hold
of your head, that's all.

1127
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:24,082
I was relieved, though,
when you came out in the hospital
and you only had one head.

1128
01:03:26,212 --> 01:03:29,329
- Very funny.
- She-- She kills me!

1129
01:03:29,412 --> 01:03:31,721
- Oh, he was such a cute baby.
- It would've been kinda nice...

1130
01:03:31,812 --> 01:03:35,771
- if he had, like, a third eye
right there, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

1131
01:03:35,852 --> 01:03:38,366
- I-- M-Mel--
- You know, you know, a third eye
is a symbol of enlightenment.

1132
01:03:38,452 --> 01:03:40,488
- You kn-- You know, he's not--
he's not, he's not getting it. He's--
- Mel.

1133
01:03:40,572 --> 01:03:44,281
- Identity is nothing
but a mental construct.
- Mental construct?

1134
01:03:44,372 --> 01:03:48,684
- You mustn't fixate on it.
- Have you ever read any Tibetan
Buddhism, like Chaos theory?

1135
01:03:48,772 --> 01:03:52,003
- Oh, Geez.
- Paul?

1136
01:03:52,092 --> 01:03:55,323
- Is he okay?
- Oh!
- Are you okay there, Paul?

1137
01:03:55,412 --> 01:03:58,927
- Is this a musical table?
- ''Is this a musical table''?
- Paul, can I get you something?

1138
01:03:59,012 --> 01:04:02,163
- I'm not feeling very well.
- What, what do you mean?
What is it? What, what is it?
- Let me help you. What is it?

1139
01:04:02,252 --> 01:04:04,812
- What are you going through?
- Do you want-- Do you want to lie down?
- I don't know.

1140
01:04:04,892 --> 01:04:08,601
- Can, can I get you something, Paul?
- How do you feel?
- Vivid.

1141
01:04:08,692 --> 01:04:12,526
- Paul? Here.
- What?
- I'm seeing colours
that I don't want to see.

1142
01:04:12,612 --> 01:04:15,570
-Did you hear that? He's seeing colours.
-Just go with it. That's all right.
He needs to lie down.

1143
01:04:15,652 --> 01:04:18,928
- Wait, let me move this.
You're gonna have to help me.
- Everything's moving.

1144
01:04:19,012 --> 01:04:22,607
- Paul, can you hear me?
- Goddam it! Lonnie!

1145
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:26,401
- Lonnie!
- Don't fly off the handle.
- Come in here. Come here.

1146
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:28,881
- What did you do to Paul's quail?
- Nothing. Why?

1147
01:04:28,972 --> 01:04:31,884
Come on. Don't give me that
fake innocence. What did you do?

1148
01:04:31,972 --> 01:04:34,611
I dosed Mel's dish. I meant it
for Mel, and then he ate it.

1149
01:04:34,692 --> 01:04:37,809
- Oh, my God. How much?
- Two and a half tabs.

1150
01:04:37,892 --> 01:04:41,202
Two and a half tabs?
Are you crazy? Are you nuts?

1151
01:04:41,292 --> 01:04:43,248
Doesn't your mother have
enough to worry about tonight?

1152
01:04:43,332 --> 01:04:46,210
- I just don't understand this.
- Why do you ha-- Now, why do you
have to talk to me like that?

1153
01:04:46,292 --> 01:04:48,089
- Am I-- Am I talking
to him in some special way?
- It's really embarrassing to me...

1154
01:04:48,172 --> 01:04:50,083
and I really don't
appreciate it in front of him.

1155
01:04:50,172 --> 01:04:52,527
- I mean, who is he?
- What-- What's wrong with him? What--
- You got the whole
science thing going...

1156
01:04:52,612 --> 01:04:55,763
and the next thing I, I know,
you like him better than me
because he's more like you than I am.

1157
01:04:55,852 --> 01:04:59,765
- We love you very much. Even if you
were Jeffrey Dahmer, we would love you.
- Yeah, sure!

1158
01:04:59,852 --> 01:05:02,161
- Oh, you know, Mom spare me the hyp--
- Wait, I'm not here to take your place.

1159
01:05:02,252 --> 01:05:04,368
- Please, Mel, please!
- Where do you get this insecurity from?

1160
01:05:04,452 --> 01:05:06,488
- I don't understand it.
This drives me nuts!
- Uh, honey?

1161
01:05:06,572 --> 01:05:08,642
- Richard, you're criticizing.
- All right, all right.

1162
01:05:08,732 --> 01:05:13,089
I want you to apologize to Mel
and to Paul right now. C'mon. C'mon.

1163
01:05:13,172 --> 01:05:15,891
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry for what?
- I'm sorry...

1164
01:05:15,972 --> 01:05:19,885
that I put windowpane in Mel's quail,
and I'm sorry that you ate it.

1165
01:05:19,972 --> 01:05:22,691
All right. All right. Go sit down.
I can't believe he--

1166
01:05:22,772 --> 01:05:27,163
Let's not blow this out
of proportion, everyone. Paul's
gonna come down in about ten hours.

1167
01:05:27,252 --> 01:05:29,368
- Ten hours?
- I-- It's-- I-- It's--

1168
01:05:29,452 --> 01:05:33,240
I can't believe you-- you're
actually keeping acid in the house
after you went to prison for it.

1169
01:05:33,332 --> 01:05:36,165
- Wait till your son is 19. See if he
does everything you want him to do.
- Tina.

1170
01:05:36,252 --> 01:05:40,165
- This is classic!
Yeah, just keep, uh-- keep blaming
it all on me, all your crap.
- Ah, just go with it.

1171
01:05:40,252 --> 01:05:44,450
You just simmer down, you.
And you take a little responsibility
for what you've done.

1172
01:05:44,532 --> 01:05:47,490
- Thank you, Mrs Cleaver.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- All there is.

1173
01:05:47,572 --> 01:05:51,087
- This is a non-smoking house.
- You're gonna be all right.
- Are you kidding?
-Just go with it.

1174
01:05:51,172 --> 01:05:53,481
- We're gonna take quite a trip.
- You know, it's been a long day...

1175
01:05:53,572 --> 01:05:55,563
and, uh, I'm really, really tired.

1176
01:05:55,652 --> 01:05:58,450
So, uh, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna hit the hay.

1177
01:05:58,532 --> 01:06:00,682
Thank you very much for, um, dinner.
It was wonderful.

1178
01:06:00,772 --> 01:06:03,161
- My love in Paris
- Shh!

1179
01:06:03,252 --> 01:06:06,369
- Knows my secret
-Just go with it.Just go with it.
- He's gonna be fine.

1180
01:06:06,452 --> 01:06:09,171
- She's a great guide.
- I'm, I'm sure you are
an excellent guide.

1181
01:06:09,252 --> 01:06:13,768
And I would like to thank you again
for this wonderful evening.
It was really great.

1182
01:06:13,852 --> 01:06:16,491
- It was great seeing you. Yeah.
- Yeah. Thanks.
- I mean, I loved meeting you.

1183
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:18,847
I loved meeting you too,
and I'm just gonna hit the hay.

1184
01:06:18,932 --> 01:06:21,127
- Now, you're sure
that you don't want dessert?
- Really feel awful.
- No.

1185
01:06:21,212 --> 01:06:24,010
- Um, I think I'm gonna
lay off the food, yeah.
- Close.

1186
01:06:24,092 --> 01:06:26,003
- If you get hungry later,
it's in the fridge, okay?
- Okay, good night.
Nighty-night, you two. Uh, night.

1187
01:06:26,092 --> 01:06:29,084
- Will do. Yum! Good night.
- Chocolate mousse. You're gonna
love it. You're gonna-- Yeah.

1188
01:06:29,172 --> 01:06:31,481
- Very nice to meet you.
It was really great.
- See ya, Tina.
- Tina! Good night, Tina.

1189
01:06:31,572 --> 01:06:34,962
- Go with it, Paul.
- I guess it's just
one of those ex-felon...

1190
01:06:35,052 --> 01:06:37,088
pro-acid kind of non-smoking homes.

1191
01:06:37,172 --> 01:06:40,403
It's a weird, weird home.
And where's Nancy? Where is she?

1192
01:06:40,492 --> 01:06:44,485
- She's somewhere in one of these
rooms with Tony. They're in there--
- You know what, Mel?

1193
01:06:44,572 --> 01:06:47,484
You need to settle down.
This is overwhelming.
This is hitting you all at once.

1194
01:06:47,572 --> 01:06:50,370
You know what, sweetheart? Just--
Just come in here for a second.

1195
01:06:50,452 --> 01:06:53,012
We'll just sit down, cool off a bit.

1196
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:55,083
Boy!

1197
01:06:55,172 --> 01:06:57,732
Oh, boy.

1198
01:06:57,812 --> 01:07:01,327
Well, you know,
what did I expect, right?

1199
01:07:05,852 --> 01:07:08,207
I'm sorry this is all
hitting you at the same time...

1200
01:07:08,292 --> 01:07:12,808
but after it passes and things settle
down, you can think about starting over.

1201
01:07:16,292 --> 01:07:19,329
- Why can't you just use soap?
- You know, soap dries your skin out.

1202
01:07:19,412 --> 01:07:24,202
Not that I'm one of those women
who obsesses about old-looking
skin after pregnancy.

1203
01:07:24,292 --> 01:07:27,170
- I just happen to be obsessing
about it right now.
- Well--

1204
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:30,642
- Wait, wait, wait.
- You know, you're absolutely right.
We don't need to rush into this.

1205
01:07:30,732 --> 01:07:33,007
- I haven't even
finalized my divorce yet.
- No, I could've kissed you just now...

1206
01:07:33,092 --> 01:07:36,801
and felt okay about it, but I didn't,
and I felt really wrong.

1207
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:40,886
Don't take this personally,
but with all your nervous energy...

1208
01:07:40,972 --> 01:07:43,930
you kinda remind me
of my mother. Ow!

1209
01:07:44,012 --> 01:07:47,004
- Do you mind if I look at your armpit?
- My armpit?

1210
01:07:47,092 --> 01:07:50,209
Yeah, it's my favourite part of
a woman's body. I mean, it-- May I?

1211
01:07:50,292 --> 01:07:52,601
- What's attractive about an armpit?
- Are you kidding? Lots of things.

1212
01:07:52,692 --> 01:07:56,446
Look at this, the definition.
Look at the contours here.

1213
01:07:56,532 --> 01:07:59,842
The depth of the pocket.
Feel that? So nice.

1214
01:07:59,932 --> 01:08:02,605
- Of course I feel rejected.
- I'm sorry.

1215
01:08:02,692 --> 01:08:05,889
But I shouldn't. You're not
an appropriate partner for me.

1216
01:08:05,972 --> 01:08:09,328
Your life's a mess, and you
don't make enough money anyway.

1217
01:08:09,412 --> 01:08:11,721
That's a really nasty thing to say.

1218
01:08:11,812 --> 01:08:14,326
You just told me
I reminded you of your mother.

1219
01:08:14,412 --> 01:08:17,449
Well, she's-- I mean,
she's a good person.
She's got a lot of great qualities.

1220
01:08:17,532 --> 01:08:19,568
Uh, uh--

1221
01:08:22,252 --> 01:08:26,723
I don't want to wreck your marriage.
I know how painful that that can be.

1222
01:08:26,812 --> 01:08:30,009
My marriage is obviously
vulnerable at this point.

1223
01:08:30,092 --> 01:08:32,401
Every marriage is vulnerable,
otherwise being married...

1224
01:08:32,492 --> 01:08:35,006
wouldn't mean anything, would it?

1225
01:08:38,732 --> 01:08:40,723
- Paul.
- Tony. I need to see Tony.
- No, I want you to--

1226
01:08:40,812 --> 01:08:43,326
- I want you to tell me if
you have a favourite animal.
- Oh, that's so stupid.

1227
01:08:43,412 --> 01:08:46,529
Listen to what Mary says. She's
a great guide, okay? Just listen to her.

1228
01:08:46,612 --> 01:08:48,409
- Okay.
- What's your--
- A dog.

1229
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:51,529
- A dog. Uh, what is your favourite dog?
- A coll-- St Bernard. St Bernard.

1230
01:08:51,612 --> 01:08:55,605
St Bernard. Good. I want you
to picture a big, furry St Bernard
curled up by the fireplace.

1231
01:08:55,692 --> 01:08:58,411
- Can I change my mind? Yeah.
- No, no, we're-- we're gonna
stick with the St Bernard.

1232
01:08:58,492 --> 01:09:00,801
- I want to do a Springer Spaniel.
- No, it doesn't have to be
the perfect dog.

1233
01:09:00,892 --> 01:09:03,725
- Uh, Dalmatian. Dal--
- No, no, no. D--

1234
01:09:03,812 --> 01:09:07,930
- Okay, Dalmatian. Now,
this dog represents security--
- Schnauzer.

1235
01:09:08,012 --> 01:09:10,207
- What?
- Schnauzer.
- Shut the fuck up!

1236
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:13,489
- I am trying to help you.
Do you understand me?
- Hey, come on, sweetheart.

1237
01:09:13,572 --> 01:09:17,451
- You're so good.Just relax, okay?
Just take it easy now. Take it easy.
- Okay. Okay, okay. Paul! Paul!

1238
01:09:17,532 --> 01:09:20,968
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

1239
01:09:21,052 --> 01:09:23,441
Can we stop
all this craziness, huh?

1240
01:09:23,532 --> 01:09:26,968
- Yes! I wasn't even enjoying that.
- It seems like you were enjoying it.

1241
01:09:27,052 --> 01:09:30,761
- The attention, maybe, but--
- Okay. All right.
Time for you to go, okay?

1242
01:09:30,852 --> 01:09:33,286
You haven't been treating her very well.
Do you know that?

1243
01:09:33,372 --> 01:09:36,205
Oh, uh-- You know what? You know what,
buddy? You know, you got a lot of nerve.

1244
01:09:36,292 --> 01:09:38,601
You come in here,
you lick my wife's armpit.

1245
01:09:38,692 --> 01:09:41,684
You know, you-- I, uh, uh, uh--
I'm gonna have that image in my head...

1246
01:09:41,772 --> 01:09:46,004
- for the rest of my life of your tongue
in there. I-- It's, it's, it's--
- You deserve it.

1247
01:09:46,092 --> 01:09:48,003
- This is felonious,
and I want to make an arrest.
- Warm him up.

1248
01:09:48,092 --> 01:09:50,686
- Shh!
- What? What he say?
- He's tripping his brains out.

1249
01:09:50,772 --> 01:09:53,764
- He doesn't know who he is.
- Did he say-- he say-- He said
arrest. What do you mean he--
We don't know who he is.

1250
01:09:53,852 --> 01:09:57,765
- He's Mel's friend Paul.
- I know exactly who I am.
I'm Paul Harmon.

1251
01:09:57,852 --> 01:10:00,764
- Good.
- Bureau of Tobacco, Tobacco,
and Tobacco.

1252
01:10:00,852 --> 01:10:03,491
- Good. What is this, Paul?
- It is a badge.

1253
01:10:03,572 --> 01:10:05,642
- What kind of badge?
- I'm a Special Agent man.

1254
01:10:05,732 --> 01:10:10,328
Twenty years in the service.
Graduated fourth in my class.

1255
01:10:10,412 --> 01:10:13,085
- Is this a-- Is this a joke?
- I don't joke about those things.
- Goddam it.

1256
01:10:13,172 --> 01:10:16,403
- I knew it was weird.
I knew it. When they called up
out of the blue like that, I knew.
- He's--

1257
01:10:16,492 --> 01:10:20,121
- No, you had to see your son.
- He's kidding. He's making a joke.
He's just-- Oh.

1258
01:10:20,212 --> 01:10:22,965
- You're not kidding. Shit.
- I am not kidding.
Everything is under control.
- Okay. All right.

1259
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:26,886
All right. I want you to both move over
against that wall. This is an arrest.

1260
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:29,361
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.

1261
01:10:29,452 --> 01:10:31,886
If you cannot afford an attorney,
we will provide an attorney for you...

1262
01:10:31,972 --> 01:10:34,884
because we provide things
for you people all the--

1263
01:10:34,972 --> 01:10:37,281
Oh! That really hurt.

1264
01:10:39,332 --> 01:10:42,404
I can't follow your fickle
little moods all over the place.

1265
01:10:42,492 --> 01:10:44,528
- That has got to change.
- Okay, I will. I promise.

1266
01:10:44,612 --> 01:10:46,807
If you just give me a chance,
let me show you I can be less selfish.

1267
01:10:46,892 --> 01:10:49,565
I-- I-I will show you.
You will get concrete results.

1268
01:10:49,652 --> 01:10:52,769
You have got to earn that back
with some consistent behaviour, pal.

1269
01:10:52,852 --> 01:10:55,969
Look, I'm sorry I acted this way.
I'm sorry I've treated you this way.

1270
01:10:56,052 --> 01:10:58,520
I-- I've got to be out of my mind
to risk losing you.

1271
01:10:58,612 --> 01:11:00,807
- You don't hit another human being!
- Will you be quiet!
- My-- Goddam it!

1272
01:11:00,892 --> 01:11:03,725
Just shut the hell up!
Just be quiet.

1273
01:11:03,812 --> 01:11:07,009
All right, nobody heard us
upstairs. We're all right.

1274
01:11:07,092 --> 01:11:09,208
- We have to get him to a doctor.
- Oh, no. There's no doctor.
Forget the doctor.

1275
01:11:09,292 --> 01:11:12,090
- What, no doctor? He's hurt. Paul.
- I've gotta think of what
we're gonna do.Just give me a minute.

1276
01:11:12,172 --> 01:11:14,527
- Paul, wake up. Wake up, Paul.
- I'm not-- I'm not goin' back to jail.
I'm not going back to jail.

1277
01:11:14,612 --> 01:11:17,251
- Paul, wake up.
- You know where I'm goin'? I'm goin'
to Mexico. We're all goin' to Mexico.

1278
01:11:17,332 --> 01:11:19,926
- And we're taking him as a hostage.
- A hostage?

1279
01:11:20,012 --> 01:11:23,049
- Cool!
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not going to jail again.

1280
01:11:23,132 --> 01:11:25,327
- You understand me?
I'm not going to jail!
- Oh, my God.

1281
01:11:25,412 --> 01:11:28,051
This has to be a mistake.
Mel wouldn't do this to us.

1282
01:11:28,132 --> 01:11:31,442
- How do you know it's Mel?
How do you know who Mel is?
Mel is probably in on this. Mel--
- He's a-- He's a pig!

1283
01:11:31,532 --> 01:11:34,569
How do you know it's our son?
It's not our son. It's some
fucking Federal Agent!

1284
01:11:34,652 --> 01:11:36,643
- Goddam it.
- I know it's our son. I can tell.

1285
01:11:36,732 --> 01:11:39,804
- Uh, w--
- You think a mother
doesn't know these things?
-Just shut up for a minute and listen.

1286
01:11:39,892 --> 01:11:42,452
We're gonna take him in the car,
then we go down to San Miguel
to Stuart's place.

1287
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:44,921
- We can be there by morning.
Grab his foot. This guy is--
- Paul, wake-- No!

1288
01:11:45,012 --> 01:11:48,721
No. I am not walking away from a home
that took us 20 years to put together.

1289
01:11:48,812 --> 01:11:51,770
- This guy is--
- No!
- The wheel barrow.
- This is insane.

1290
01:11:51,852 --> 01:11:55,765
We can't take him hostage.
This is a much bigger crime.

1291
01:11:55,852 --> 01:11:58,446
- Well, what'll we do?
What'll-- What'll we do with him?
- Dump-- Dump him in the brush.

1292
01:11:58,532 --> 01:12:00,921
- Brush! Good, good.
- Leave him and get outta here.

1293
01:12:01,012 --> 01:12:04,482
- Lonnie.
- Yeah.
- Go clean out the lab.
- Right.

1294
01:12:04,572 --> 01:12:07,211
Don't break anything!

1295
01:12:27,532 --> 01:12:29,568
No, no, no.
Wai-- Wait a minute.

1296
01:12:29,652 --> 01:12:32,644
Shit! This truck is not going
to make it to Mexico.

1297
01:12:32,732 --> 01:12:35,485
- So what are we--
- Oh, shit!

1298
01:12:40,292 --> 01:12:42,408
Put it in here.

1299
01:13:01,972 --> 01:13:04,770
My sciatica is killing me.

1300
01:13:04,852 --> 01:13:06,763
Would've been here an hour ago
if you'd listened to me.

1301
01:13:06,852 --> 01:13:09,889
It took two hours to find
that there's no place to get
a good sandwich around here.

1302
01:13:09,972 --> 01:13:13,009
You can't keep making U-turns
in the middle of a highway, Eddie...

1303
01:13:13,092 --> 01:13:15,890
- even if you see what
looks like a sandwich shop.
- Let's get this over with.

1304
01:13:15,972 --> 01:13:19,362
Eddie-- Eddie, wait. Don't.

1305
01:13:19,452 --> 01:13:22,091
What's the matter?
Come on!

1306
01:13:22,172 --> 01:13:26,370
- I can't go in there.
- Why not?

1307
01:13:26,452 --> 01:13:28,966
- Look at this house.
- What's the matter with it?

1308
01:13:29,052 --> 01:13:32,931
Well, it's so all-American. It's--

1309
01:13:33,012 --> 01:13:35,810
- What are you talking about?
- Well, they're probably...

1310
01:13:35,892 --> 01:13:38,406
quiet, reasonable,
sensible people...

1311
01:13:38,492 --> 01:13:40,960
and Mel loves them,
and, you know, we're neur--

1312
01:13:41,052 --> 01:13:43,964
- And he-- We're a source
of embarrassment to him.
- But he's in trouble...

1313
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:46,885
and that's why we came!

1314
01:13:46,972 --> 01:13:51,045
- It's possible I overreacted.
- Now you think you overreacted?

1315
01:13:51,132 --> 01:13:52,884
- Yeah. We--
- We just got off an aeroplane.

1316
01:13:52,972 --> 01:13:54,690
- We drove five and a half
hours in the desert...
- Listen, Eddie...

1317
01:13:54,772 --> 01:13:57,570
- and you're telling me
that you overreacted?
- I am not going in there to be
rejected in front of his new parents!

1318
01:13:57,652 --> 01:14:00,086
- Yes, you are! Come on. Pearl.
- No, I'm not. Let go of me.

1319
01:14:00,172 --> 01:14:01,605
- Come on, Pearl.
- You're hurting my arm.

1320
01:14:01,692 --> 01:14:03,603
- You feel that?
- Get in the car before they hear us.

1321
01:14:03,692 --> 01:14:06,570
- I thought we were gonna eat here.
I'm starving.
- We'll go back to the taco place.

1322
01:14:06,652 --> 01:14:10,088
- Tacos have cheese in them.
- Not all tacos have
cheese in them, Eddie.

1323
01:14:10,172 --> 01:14:12,606
- Wait, is this our car?
- Of course it's our car.

1324
01:14:12,692 --> 01:14:17,925
- Do you remember this truck?
- What, do you have early Alzheimer's?
It's a white rental car--

1325
01:14:32,612 --> 01:14:34,807
- Where's the car?
- It's over here.
What's the matter with you?

1326
01:14:34,892 --> 01:14:36,962
- Why did you move it?
- I thought you moved it.

1327
01:14:37,052 --> 01:14:40,089
- Why would I move it?
- I don't know, Dad.
- What are we taking that car for?

1328
01:14:40,172 --> 01:14:42,083
- I wanna take the blue truck.
- No, no, we can't take the truck.

1329
01:14:42,172 --> 01:14:45,448
- The truck can't make an 800-mile trip.
- Oh, no. My blue truck.
I want my blue truck.

1330
01:14:45,532 --> 01:14:48,285
- Mom, come o-- come on!
- But my water broke in this truck.

1331
01:14:48,372 --> 01:14:51,967
Get in the car.
I love you. Get in the car.

1332
01:14:52,052 --> 01:14:56,125
Are you sure
all your doubting is over?

1333
01:14:56,212 --> 01:14:59,807
I'm sorry I took you for granted.
I'm sorry I hurt you.

1334
01:15:03,412 --> 01:15:05,403
I want to go home tomorrow.

1335
01:15:05,492 --> 01:15:09,485
So do I.
I want to get out of here.

1336
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:32,125
- Slow down. There's the taco place.
- Why didn't you tell me you saw it?

1337
01:15:32,212 --> 01:15:34,567
I did tell you.
You were driving too fast.

1338
01:15:34,652 --> 01:15:37,212
You can't make U-turns
like this, Eddie.

1339
01:15:37,292 --> 01:15:40,250
- Relax. We're in the middle of nowhere.
- The, the sign!

1340
01:15:40,332 --> 01:15:43,768
The sign, the sign! The--
Aah! The car!

1341
01:15:45,292 --> 01:15:47,362
Goddam tourists! Shit!

1342
01:15:47,452 --> 01:15:50,808
- What did I just tell you
about the U-turns?
- He was in my blind spot.

1343
01:15:50,892 --> 01:15:54,521
You could fit the state
of Wisconsin in your blind spot.

1344
01:15:54,612 --> 01:15:57,604
-It's their fault. They're in the wrong.
-Doesn't matter. I don't want
some sheriff to come by here.

1345
01:15:57,692 --> 01:16:00,525
- Wh-Where's the-- Where's the acid?
- It's in the trunk, Dad. Yeah.
- It's in the trunk?

1346
01:16:00,612 --> 01:16:04,685
Look. Look, if things
get tight, I want you to do
that spastic colon thing you do.

1347
01:16:04,772 --> 01:16:06,967
-No, no, I'm not gonna do spastic colon.
-Okay, now, do-- something.

1348
01:16:07,052 --> 01:16:11,489
That thing you did when the cops
stopped us in Albuquerque, you know?
That, that, what, that ulcer thing.

1349
01:16:11,572 --> 01:16:15,611
- Um-- Uh, okay, I-- I'll do reflux.
- All right. That's good. Okay.

1350
01:16:21,052 --> 01:16:23,930
- I am so sorry!
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, we're fine.

1351
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:25,968
You can't just make
a blind U-turn like that.

1352
01:16:26,052 --> 01:16:28,691
I've got a sizable blind spot,
is my problem.

1353
01:16:28,772 --> 01:16:31,605
- Well, I don't see much damage here.
- No, it looks mostly cosmetic.

1354
01:16:31,692 --> 01:16:34,081
- Yeah. It's nothing. Why don't we
just forget about it, all right?
- No, no.

1355
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:37,323
Well, I don't know. We shouldn't
leave the scene of an accident. I'll
call the police from the taco place.

1356
01:16:37,412 --> 01:16:39,368
Well, you can call the police
if you want to, but, I mean...

1357
01:16:39,452 --> 01:16:41,761
I-I'll tell you right now,
this, this is your fault here.

1358
01:16:41,852 --> 01:16:45,891
I mean, if we make a report, y-your
insurance rates are gonna go sky-high.

1359
01:16:45,972 --> 01:16:49,487
- I mean, it's up to you, but, I mean,
I don't, I don't see the point of it.
- Uh, Pearl, he's making sense.

1360
01:16:49,572 --> 01:16:53,406
No! I have never broken the law.
I am not going to be irresponsible now.

1361
01:16:53,492 --> 01:16:56,802
- Yeah, there's nothing
irresponsible about this.
- No, absolutely. We're all fine.

1362
01:16:56,892 --> 01:16:59,008
There's-- You can see
that we're perfectly okay.

1363
01:16:59,092 --> 01:17:02,368
I, uh, I, I just have this
preexisting medical condition.

1364
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:05,728
My ileocecal valve is, uh--
doesn't work as it should.

1365
01:17:05,812 --> 01:17:08,280
And it allows c-corrosive juices--

1366
01:17:08,372 --> 01:17:11,205
They seem to rise up
into my oesophagus, and I--

1367
01:17:11,292 --> 01:17:14,602
I, I, I need to get home
so that I can lie down and--

1368
01:17:14,692 --> 01:17:18,810
- We, we really have to go.
- With my head elevated.

1369
01:17:18,892 --> 01:17:21,929
- Ileocecal valve?
- It's chronic.
- Nice meeting you.

1370
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:24,924
Why did you let them get away?

1371
01:17:25,012 --> 01:17:27,606
We're better off.
Who knows what our liability is?

1372
01:17:27,692 --> 01:17:32,447
Y-Yes! What, what exactly is
our deductible damage waiver?

1373
01:17:32,532 --> 01:17:35,000
Here-- Oh, my God!

1374
01:17:35,092 --> 01:17:38,482
- The car-- it's registered to Mel!
- What?

1375
01:17:38,572 --> 01:17:42,611
Look at the-- Check and see
if our luggage is in the trunk.

1376
01:17:49,092 --> 01:17:51,128
Huh?

1377
01:17:52,972 --> 01:17:55,281
What the hell is this?

1378
01:18:03,652 --> 01:18:07,725
Sometimes the light's
all shining on me

1379
01:18:09,972 --> 01:18:14,090
Other times, I can barely see

1380
01:18:14,172 --> 01:18:16,527
- So then what happened?
- I don't know--
I don't know where anybody is.

1381
01:18:16,612 --> 01:18:18,807
- I mean, I assume-- I mean,
look at this place. It's a wreck.
- Well, I see the place.

1382
01:18:18,892 --> 01:18:21,087
- I-I guess they probably-- Well, then--
- And I'm looking for him,
and I can't find him.

1383
01:18:21,172 --> 01:18:25,404
- So where--
- They probably took him to
the hospital, Tony. I mean, he, he was--

1384
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:29,041
They didn't take him
to the hospital. Look. Paul!

1385
01:18:29,132 --> 01:18:31,487
Oh, my God!

1386
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:36,807
- Truckin', I'm a-going home
- You can't catch the wind!

1387
01:18:36,892 --> 01:18:39,326
Whoa, whoa, baby
back where I belong

1388
01:18:39,412 --> 01:18:41,721
-Jerry? W--
- Mm-hmm.

1389
01:18:41,812 --> 01:18:43,723
-Jerry Garcia Jerry?
- Yeah!

1390
01:18:43,812 --> 01:18:46,690
I mean, it's in the family.
It's got a whole history to it.

1391
01:18:46,772 --> 01:18:49,161
You don't even like
the Grateful Dead.

1392
01:18:49,252 --> 01:18:52,449
I never said I don't like them.
I just haven't ever listened to
that much of their music.

1393
01:18:52,532 --> 01:18:54,488
Unless you still like Ethan.

1394
01:18:54,572 --> 01:18:58,451
This is obviously much more important
to you than it is to me.

1395
01:18:58,532 --> 01:19:01,604
Okay? So you pick the name.
But I'll just say one thing.

1396
01:19:01,692 --> 01:19:03,967
- What?
- I think Jerry is very pedestrian.

1397
01:19:04,052 --> 01:19:06,361
How 'bout Garcia?

1398
01:19:06,452 --> 01:19:09,046
- Garcia?
- Garcia Coplin.

1399
01:19:09,132 --> 01:19:12,363
Garcia! Garcia Coplin.

1400
01:19:12,452 --> 01:19:14,682
- Look. Look, he likes it.
- I like it too.

1401
01:19:14,772 --> 01:19:17,366
- Garcia Coplin.
- Yeah.

1402
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,568
- Garcia.
- Yeah.

1403
01:19:21,852 --> 01:19:24,650
- You think I should get that?
- Sure.

1404
01:19:27,252 --> 01:19:29,641
Hello? Shit-- Shitkings--

1405
01:19:29,732 --> 01:19:32,565
- Schlichting.
- Schlichtings' residence.

1406
01:19:32,812 --> 01:19:35,406
- What kind of trouble are you in?
- Us? We're not in trouble.
You're the ones who're in jail.

1407
01:19:35,492 --> 01:19:38,211
There were drugs in the trunk
of your car. Why are there
drugs in the trunk of your car?

1408
01:19:38,292 --> 01:19:40,681
- How did you get our car?
- We tracked you to the ''Shitkings''...

1409
01:19:40,772 --> 01:19:42,967
-Will you-- Will you hurry.
-because we thought you were in trouble.

1410
01:19:43,052 --> 01:19:45,520
- Well, why did you think
we were in trouble?
- Because of the phone call.

1411
01:19:45,612 --> 01:19:50,322
- The truck and the baby.
- Oh, no-- No, Ma, I was talking to that
evil little dwarf woman at the B-and-B.

1412
01:19:50,412 --> 01:19:53,370
- We wer-- We weren't in trouble.
- Oh.
- Your mother as usual has overreacted.

1413
01:19:53,452 --> 01:19:56,046
- I did not overreact, Eddie!
If I overreacted...
- Well, you said in front of--

1414
01:19:56,132 --> 01:19:59,329
why am I wearing handcuffs
in the middle of a jail?

1415
01:19:59,412 --> 01:20:03,007
Th-There's obviously
been some mishap, sir.
These people are not drug runners.

1416
01:20:03,092 --> 01:20:06,004
I mean, look at them.
They're, they're from New York.
They're, they're my parents.

1417
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:08,208
You hear that, Eddie?
He called us his parents.

1418
01:20:08,292 --> 01:20:10,806
Of course you're
my parents. Mom--

1419
01:20:10,892 --> 01:20:13,281
Oh, Mel.

1420
01:20:13,372 --> 01:20:15,806
- Ow, Ma, your chain's
pulling on my hair.
- Wait a minute. Wait.

1421
01:20:15,892 --> 01:20:18,122
Sorry, darling.

1422
01:20:18,212 --> 01:20:21,124
Bobby, take these forms back
to the office, these release forms.

1423
01:20:21,212 --> 01:20:24,522
And get these nice people their
car keys. This is all over here.

1424
01:20:24,612 --> 01:20:27,843
This is a Federal agent here,
and he just told me the whole story
about the ''Shlytings.''

1425
01:20:27,932 --> 01:20:30,446
- ''Schlitinooks.''
- ''Shitkings.''
- No, Schlichtings.

1426
01:20:30,532 --> 01:20:33,330
Well, anyway, it's clear
that we have the wrong people here.

1427
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:37,200
- They found--
- That's what I've been trying to tell
this guy for the last half hour.
- Thank God for this Federal agent.

1428
01:20:37,292 --> 01:20:41,046
And by the way, w-w-why
are you not wearing pants?

1429
01:20:41,132 --> 01:20:43,771
- I had an experience, that's why.
- What do you mean?

1430
01:20:43,852 --> 01:20:49,006
I resisted at first, and then it evolved
and it continues to evolve for me.

1431
01:20:49,092 --> 01:20:52,562
I don't know what the hell
he's talking about, but I got some
jewellery somewhere, if you please.

1432
01:20:52,652 --> 01:20:55,325
- A diamond and some turquoise.
- Yes, ma'am. Sure, just let me
get those cuffs for you.

1433
01:20:55,572 --> 01:20:59,565
I don't know. We may be able
to work out a private adoption
through some people I know in Colorado.

1434
01:20:59,652 --> 01:21:02,883
- How long will that take?
- Usually six to-- months
to a year. I don't know.

1435
01:21:02,972 --> 01:21:05,930
But if you're willing to wait,
you know, I may be able to find
a couple of lesbians...

1436
01:21:06,012 --> 01:21:08,207
- who would be willing to conceive...
- That's good. Lesbians are good.

1437
01:21:08,292 --> 01:21:11,443
- and then you could share
the baby with them.
- No way. I'm not gonna do that.
- No? Why?

1438
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:15,445
- I think these two are homosexuals.
- They want to adopt a kid.
That's so sick.

1439
01:21:15,532 --> 01:21:19,047
Can you imagine the neurosis
that child would be exposed to?

1440
01:21:19,132 --> 01:21:21,202
- Okay. Okay, here we go.
- Okay.

1441
01:21:21,292 --> 01:21:23,601
- Everyone, pull together. Paul, smile.
- Are we ready? Okay.

1442
01:21:23,692 --> 01:21:26,001
One, two!

1443
01:21:51,492 --> 01:21:55,326
- Yo, ye pharaohs, let us walk
- Are you okay?

1444
01:21:55,412 --> 01:21:58,324
Through this barren desert
in search of truth

1445
01:21:58,412 --> 01:22:02,485
And some pointy boots
and maybe a few snack crackers

1446
01:22:05,412 --> 01:22:08,961
Baby, you make me wanna walk

1447
01:22:09,052 --> 01:22:11,168
- All right. All right.
- Like a camel

1448
01:22:11,252 --> 01:22:14,164
- Why do we have to baby-sit tonight?
- Oh, sweetie.

1449
01:22:14,252 --> 01:22:17,961
- Come on, come on. Ahh, yes.
- All right. Shh.

1450
01:22:18,052 --> 01:22:20,282
Okay. Here. That's-- Oh, I know--

1451
01:22:20,372 --> 01:22:23,330
- Because the kids need some time alone.
- The kids need time alone?

1452
01:22:23,412 --> 01:22:27,849
Yes! God, Eddie,
where's your sense of romance?

1453
01:22:33,132 --> 01:22:34,929
Who's in charge here

1454
01:22:35,012 --> 01:22:37,651
- Where's my captain's wafers
- I can't, I can't.
It's making me too nervous.

1455
01:22:37,732 --> 01:22:41,407
- Oh, it made you nervous when he
was in the other room. Come on.
- Okay.

1456
01:22:41,492 --> 01:22:43,881
- Maybe next--
- Will you relax, please?

1457
01:22:43,972 --> 01:22:45,928
- Is that my beeper?
- No, that's not your beeper.

1458
01:22:46,012 --> 01:22:48,765
- Let's get this beeper
and this gun out of here.
- No, my gun--

1459
01:22:48,852 --> 01:22:51,446
Wanna walk

1460
01:22:51,532 --> 01:22:53,682
Like a camel

1461
01:22:55,772 --> 01:22:58,605
It's a blind date. I don't know.
Some benefit or something.

1462
01:22:58,692 --> 01:23:01,570
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1463
01:23:01,652 --> 01:23:04,212
No, I am not smoking, Mother.
Look, I gotta go.

1464
01:23:04,292 --> 01:23:08,331
He's here.
Yeah, he knows. Mm-hmm.

1465
01:23:08,412 --> 01:23:11,882
Yeah, I know.
I'll call you tomorrow. Uh-- Uh-huh.

1466
01:23:11,972 --> 01:23:15,169
Pain in my ass.
I'm coming!

1467
01:23:15,252 --> 01:23:19,131
Say, you don't think there's, uh
any way I can get that quarter

1468
01:23:19,212 --> 01:23:22,887
From underneath
of your pointy boot, do you
All I want--

1469
01:23:22,972 --> 01:23:26,169
- Shalom, shalom.
- Shalom, shalom.

1470
01:23:26,252 --> 01:23:28,766
Shalom. Deeper.

1471
01:23:28,852 --> 01:23:32,288
You guys, this place sucks.
Everybody speaks Spanish.

1472
01:23:32,372 --> 01:23:34,886
- Did you ever hear of knocking?
- What are you looking for?

1473
01:23:34,972 --> 01:23:37,088
- I'm looking for some weed.
- No, you find your own weed.

1474
01:23:37,172 --> 01:23:39,811
- Get out of that drawer.
- You guys, I'm totally bored here.

1475
01:23:39,892 --> 01:23:43,726
Honey-- Honey, it takes time
to make new friends. Be patient.

1476
01:23:45,692 --> 01:23:48,331
Say, you don't think
there's, uh, any way

1477
01:23:48,412 --> 01:23:53,122
I could get that quarter from underneath
of your pointy boot, do you

1478
01:23:53,212 --> 01:23:56,488
All I want is
just one more oatmeal pie

1479
01:23:59,452 --> 01:24:03,127
Little Debbie, Little Debbie
I'm a-comin'on home, baby

1480
01:24:03,212 --> 01:24:06,443
'Cause you make me wanna walk

1481
01:24:06,532 --> 01:24:08,443
Like a camel

1482
01:24:30,132 --> 01:24:34,489
I sing a song 'bout
clouds and rainbows

1483
01:24:34,572 --> 01:24:38,884
I hum a tune
that sings like a dove

1484
01:24:38,972 --> 01:24:43,568
Found some words 'bout anything

1485
01:24:43,652 --> 01:24:47,770
Anything but love

1486
01:24:47,852 --> 01:24:52,084
I paint a picture of my prison

1487
01:24:52,172 --> 01:24:56,882
With blue and grey
from the sky above

1488
01:24:56,972 --> 01:25:01,284
Framed and signed
with the title

1489
01:25:01,372 --> 01:25:04,444
Anything but love

1490
01:25:05,652 --> 01:25:09,930
He had to go
But I won't miss him

1491
01:25:10,012 --> 01:25:14,403
I've got better things to do

1492
01:25:14,492 --> 01:25:18,804
Like writing stories
and painting pictures

1493
01:25:18,892 --> 01:25:21,929
Of anything but love

1494
01:25:23,532 --> 01:25:26,410
Anything but love

1495
01:25:28,012 --> 01:25:31,448
Anything but love

1496
01:25:42,972 --> 01:25:47,602
It's a terrible predicament

1497
01:25:47,692 --> 01:25:50,923
That we're in again

1498
01:25:52,772 --> 01:25:57,402
Goin'down faster and faster

1499
01:25:57,492 --> 01:25:59,403
Feel like we're fallin'

1500
01:25:59,492 --> 01:26:01,801
With the ceiling plaster

1501
01:26:06,212 --> 01:26:09,170
Flirting with disaster

1502
01:26:13,012 --> 01:26:15,480
It's a revoltin'development

1503
01:26:15,572 --> 01:26:20,009
-Amen
-Amen

1504
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:23,129
Say it again

1505
01:26:23,212 --> 01:26:27,922
This old world
is tryin'to trash us

1506
01:26:28,012 --> 01:26:33,006
Love is here
if it don't gas us

1507
01:26:36,292 --> 01:26:39,409
We're flirting with disaster

1508
01:26:43,092 --> 01:26:45,083
Caught in a whirlpool

1509
01:26:45,172 --> 01:26:47,732
My thinkin's too heady

1510
01:26:47,812 --> 01:26:50,087
Life is going by

1511
01:26:50,172 --> 01:26:53,130
And I'm not ready

1512
01:26:53,212 --> 01:26:57,922
Tryin'to find out who I am

1513
01:26:58,012 --> 01:27:00,606
Roarin'like a lion

1514
01:27:00,692 --> 01:27:04,128
Gentle as a lamb

1515
01:27:04,212 --> 01:27:08,728
- I'm gettin'a bad reputation
- You bet

1516
01:27:08,812 --> 01:27:11,724
For not knowing my mind

1517
01:27:13,772 --> 01:27:15,888
That's what I heard

1518
01:27:15,972 --> 01:27:18,725
From the schoolmaster

1519
01:27:18,812 --> 01:27:22,600
Rabbi, I ain't a bastard

1520
01:27:27,692 --> 01:27:30,604
Flirting with disaster

1521
01:27:34,132 --> 01:27:37,920
It's a terrible predicament

1522
01:27:38,012 --> 01:27:42,324
Oh, that we're in again

1523
01:27:44,252 --> 01:27:48,484
Goin'down faster and faster

1524
01:27:48,572 --> 01:27:52,121
I feel like I'm fallin'

1525
01:27:52,212 --> 01:27:54,601
With the ceiling plaster

1526
01:27:58,212 --> 01:28:00,726
Flirting with disaster

1527
01:28:03,772 --> 01:28:06,491
It's a revoltin'development

1528
01:28:06,572 --> 01:28:09,609
-Amen
-Amen

1529
01:28:09,692 --> 01:28:11,762
Amen

1530
01:28:11,852 --> 01:28:14,685
Say it again

1531
01:28:14,772 --> 01:28:18,481
This old world's
tryin'to trash us

1532
01:28:18,572 --> 01:28:21,803
Our love is here, babe

1533
01:28:21,892 --> 01:28:24,406
If it don't gas us

1534
01:28:24,492 --> 01:28:28,280
Oh, yeah, we're

1535
01:28:28,372 --> 01:28:32,604
Flirting with disaster, baby

1536
01:28:34,052 --> 01:28:37,965
Oh, we're flirting with disaster

1537
01:28:43,972 --> 01:28:47,885
Flirting with disaster

1538
01:28:52,892 --> 01:28:57,010
Amen

1539
