Ah, what the hell. Guys like
me shouldn't dream anyway

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,501

7
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:40,171

00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:43,091

12

00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:05,905

15
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,450
<i>Lost in another world far away</i>

16
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:13,079
<i>Never another world from today</i>

17
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:15,915

18
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,002

21
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:53,494
<i>Suddenly I was born unto light</i>

22
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:57,081

What the...

39
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:04,375
Hey, Sonny... Never thought
we'd see you back here again

40
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,627
I'm not exactly thrilled about it

41
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:09,172
You said this place made you crazy

42
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:11,966
I decided I'd rather
be crazy than hungry

43
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:17,263
<i>"The calculation is sensitive to

<i>The factor increases if you pay
off your mortgage in five years"</i>

45
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:23,519
Five years?

46
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:25,730
He'd be lucky if he
paid off the movers

47
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,941
Who could pay off a
house in only five years?

48
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:31,069
Rock stars don't even need
that long. They pay cash

49
00:08:31,152 --> 00:08:34,338
A million dollars, man? See
my manager. I'm busy, you know?

50
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:37,075
- Last one in, first one home
- Hey, it's Sonny

51
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,243
It's Michelangelo Malone

52
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:42,163
Michelangelo,
the ceiling needs painting

53
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,915
All right, that's enough

54
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,688
The great Sonny Malone
returns to AirFlo Records

55
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:49,337
welcomed by cheering
throngs of thousands

News at 11:00

57
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:56,469
Cut it out. You know I wouldn't
come back unless I had to

58
00:08:56,552 --> 00:09:00,598
- We were all really pulling for you
- Yeah, like one of us breaking away

59
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:03,142
Really doing it

60
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:06,145
Yeah, no paint by numbers, no
assembly line art. What happened?

61
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,273
It's what didn't happen. No bread

62
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,694
- I fought it, that's for sure
- Don't worry

63
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:16,364
I spend my whole life paintin'
what other people want

64
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,804
I paint his van...
I paint somebody else's mural...

65
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:21,119
I paint Simpson's album covers

66
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:23,979
Then when I finally
quit to freelance

67
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,915
not only do I almost starve to death

68
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,917
but I can't figure
out what I wanna do

69
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:30,670
- You can try again
- You will, won't you?

70
00:09:30,795 --> 00:09:35,133
Ah, look who decided to drop in.
Where's your white flag?

71
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:38,219
You have a way with words,
Simpson. You know that?

72
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:42,098
Same old wiseass attitude. I thought
we discussed this on the phone

73
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:44,767
when I decided to take you back

74
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:49,355
We did. But I have one question...
Why the hell did you take me back?

75
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,734
Simple. You're good. And you're
the fastest painter around

76
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:56,487
But this time no more artsy-craftsy
Sonny Malone touches, huh?

77
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:59,240
Just enlarge the album cover
the way I give it to you

78
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,409
Am I coming in loud and clear?

79
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,411
- Yeah
- Good. Here

80
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,956
You're on your way to your
next masterpiece. Get started

81
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:13,129
That's great, isn't it? Picasso
only gets to be called a genius

82
00:10:13,254 --> 00:10:16,466
I get to be called the
fastest painter around

83
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:19,177
Hey, Sonny, I have this
terrific friend. You interested?

84
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:21,637
Not right now. Hey

85
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:23,739
Ooh, she's great lookin'

86
00:10:23,865 --> 00:10:25,841
I think that's this crazy
girl. I just ran into

87
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:27,727
- Yeah?
- I was walkin' through the park

88
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:30,313
She nearly ran over me.
Then she kissed me

89
00:10:30,438 --> 00:10:32,415
Let's hear the X-rated version

90
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,610
- What did you do?
- Nothing. She took off

91
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,841
She took off? Come on! Is
this the same Sonny Malone

92
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:39,947
that drives women crazy?

93
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:42,825
I'm gonna find out who she is

94
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,245
- You mean right now?
- You're gonna be a successful artist

95
00:10:46,371 --> 00:10:49,707
- You're nuts!
- Simpson's gonna kill him

96
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:53,252
Listen, Sonny, I told ya.
I don't know who she is

97
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:56,381
She never filed a W-2
and she never got a cheque

98
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:58,925
If I never paid her,
she doesn't exist

99
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,011
What do you mean? I'm lookin' at
her. She's on the Nine Sisters' album

100
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:04,681
Not if I didn't pay her she isn't!

101
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,600
Down here at me.
Now look to your right

102
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:11,104
Yeah, that's good. Listen,
Sonny, I don't know who she is

103
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:14,524
How can you not know?
You took the picture

104
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:17,402
Listen, this sounds strange

105
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:20,321
but there wasn't supposed
to be a model on this cover

106
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,823
I snapped maybe 100 shots

107
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:25,201
In one of them this girl
just jumped into frame

108
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:27,578
The next time I saw her
was on the contact sheets

109
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:30,707
I liked it, so I used it.
That's the whole story

110
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,751
- She just appeared?
- No, appeared then disappeared

111
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:38,047
Don't go spreading this around.
This is one of my best covers

112
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:40,466
Why do you want to know 
who she is, anyway?

113
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,386
I like her

114
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,974
Hey, Lou... 
You seen her around here?

115
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:52,395
No. Pretty Hey, you're single, right?
Let me show you my daughters

116
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,982
That's great. I'm gonna go look
where. I saw her this morning

117
00:11:56,107 --> 00:11:59,110
<i>Get a balloon</i>

118
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,237
<i>Seventy-five cents</i>

119
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:05,408

- All right</i>

120
00:12:06,451 --> 00:12:09,495

- Hi

121
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,748
- There you go
- See ya

122
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,375
<i>All right, come on now</i>

123
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:41,027
Hey, mister. What are
you doin' up there?

124
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,529
Hope you don't mind a
little noontime music, kid

125
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,948
A little lunchtime serenade?

126
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,992
I don't mind. It's kinda nice

127
00:12:47,993 --> 00:12:49,952
I'm just wondering where
they laid out the body

128
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:52,267
I mean, you got something
a little more upbeat?

129
00:12:52,268 --> 00:12:53,457
Sure

130
00:12:57,627 --> 00:13:01,005
- Better?
- At least it's faster

131
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,549
- Here, give me a hand
- Sure

132
00:13:03,674 --> 00:13:06,260
Boy, they sure don't make
rocks like they used to

133
00:13:06,344 --> 00:13:08,346
- Want some popcorn?
- Yeah, thanks

134
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:12,475
- You work around here, kid?
- Pretty near. I'm at AirFlo Records

135
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,521
You in the music business? Are you
a record producer? A sound engineer?

136
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:19,065
No. I'm sort of a painter

137
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,859
You, you paint at a record business?

138
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:26,695
Not exactly. What I do is a...
I duplicate record covers

139
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:27,407
Why?

140
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:28,883
I make album covers bigger

141
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:31,035
so you can hang them
outside of record stores

142
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,830
Promotion. Sounds like
an interesting job, huh?

143
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:36,541
Yeah. Sounds like you should
take real long lunch hours

144
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:39,685
- You got it
- I used to be in the music business

145
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,963
Now I'm retired

146
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:44,841
It's a refined name for "bum"

147
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:47,927
I don't believe it

148
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:49,929
Hey, wait a minute!

149
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,293
- Hey, kid, wait up!
Where are you goin'?

150
00:13:53,294 --> 00:13:53,933
Hey you!

151
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:56,060
Come on! Hold on!

152
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,856
I gotta borrow this.
I'll bring it back

153
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:01,899
- Sure
- If you bring it back in person

154
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:04,068
You got it

155
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:19,208
Hey!

156
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:27,050
Hey, wait a minute!
Where are you going?

157
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:39,103
<i>Take that bike off the pier!</i>

158
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,195
Holy shit!

159
00:14:57,622 --> 00:14:59,499
Whoo!

160
00:14:59,624 --> 00:15:01,626
You're a real Errol Flynn, kid

161
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:03,628
What other stunts do you do?

162
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:05,630
Man, this whole thing
is screwin' me up

163
00:15:05,713 --> 00:15:07,590
- What whole thing?
- Ah, nothin'

164
00:15:07,715 --> 00:15:10,051
Come on, have a cup of coffee

165
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:15,014
Sometimes the best person
to tell something to is a stranger

166
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:17,892
Go on. What's on your mind?

167
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,894
Okay

168
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,564
I run into this girl this morning.
Never saw her before in my life

169
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,692
She kisses me and disappears

170
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:29,070
- So what's so weird about that?
- What's weird about that is

171
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:32,990
ten minutes later I see her on an
album cover I'm supposed to paint

172
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:35,493
I mean, that's crazy, right?

173
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:39,664
If I said it sounded crazy,
would you stop looking for her?

174
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:42,709
- No
- Then why ask?

175
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:44,919
So I'll keep lookin' for her

176
00:15:46,003 --> 00:15:48,256
Okay, but take a tip from me

177
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,216
What's that?

178
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:53,094
Don't look underwater any more

179
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,807
Thanks a lot

180
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,439
- Hey, Al, where you goin'?
- Sonny,

181
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,150
- it's good to see you, man
- How you doin'?

182
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:09,861
How could I go wrong with
the paint job you did on my van?

183
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:11,946
And the chicks love it

184
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,115
It's one of the finer
examples of my work

185
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,992
- It's beautiful, man
- Where you headed?

186
00:16:16,117 --> 00:16:17,910
- Eas. Where you goin'?
- West

187
00:16:17,994 --> 00:16:19,787
- I'll give you a ride
- No, that's cool

188
00:16:19,871 --> 00:16:23,624
- Forget it. I owe you one
- All right. Okay, hit it

189
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,130
Relax and enjoy it.
We're taking the scenic route

190
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:32,341
Yeah, just don't forget
I'm back here

191
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:38,660
Hey, that's the place
on the album cover!

192
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:40,600
Slow down, I wanna get off here

193
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:42,810
- Here?
- Thanks for the ride

194
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,854
Anytime, Sonny

195
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:42,120
<i>I've always been in your mind</i>

196
00:17:42,245 --> 00:17:45,581
<i>You know I will be kind</i>

197
00:17:45,707 --> 00:17:48,626
<i>I'll be guiding you</i>

198
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,546
<i>Building your dream</i>

199
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,799
<i>Has to start now</i>

200
00:17:54,924 --> 00:18:00,697
<i>There's no other road to take</i>

201
00:18:00,822 --> 00:18:03,182
<i>You won't make a mistake</i>

202
00:18:03,307 --> 00:18:08,980
<i>I'll be guiding you</i>

203
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:10,982
Wow

204
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:15,570
<i>We have to believe we are magic</i>

205
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:20,199
<i>Nothin' can stand in our way</i>

206
00:18:20,324 --> 00:18:24,829
<i>We have to believe we are magic</i>

207
00:18:24,912 --> 00:18:29,459
<i>Don't let your aim ever stray</i>

208
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:34,088
<i>And if all your hopes survive</i>

209
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,800
<i>Destiny will arrive</i>

210
00:18:39,927 --> 00:18:44,932
<i>Bring all your dreams alive</i>

211
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:49,020
<i>For you</i>

212
00:18:49,145 --> 00:18:54,150
<i>Bring all your dreams alive</i>

213
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:57,737
<i>For you</i>

214
00:18:57,862 --> 00:19:00,656
You

215
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:03,493
Me

216
00:19:03,618 --> 00:19:07,080
Hey, I've been askin'
about you all day

217
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:09,791
You may not believe this,
but I'm paintin' an album cover

218
00:19:09,874 --> 00:19:12,627
- and you're on it
- Why shouldn't I believe it?

219
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,129
Because before today,
I never laid eyes on you

220
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,298
Now I've seen you
three times in one day

221
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:21,427
- That's too coincidental
- Sounds like you don't believe it

222
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:23,617
With all that's happened to me today

223
00:19:23,618 --> 00:19:25,723
to tell you the truth,
I don't believe it

224
00:19:25,848 --> 00:19:29,519
You're right. It's too coincidental.
Someone must be setting us up

225
00:19:29,644 --> 00:19:31,625
What do you mean?
Hey, wait a minute!

226
00:19:31,626 --> 00:19:33,606
I didn't have anything
to do with this!

227
00:19:33,731 --> 00:19:37,402
- Really?
- Yeah, really, I didn't

228
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:39,404
Hey!

229
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:46,869
Who said I was talking about you?

230
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:49,872
You come here often?

231
00:19:49,997 --> 00:19:53,501
Yes. I can practise my
skating and no one bothers me

232
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:57,630
- You must live around here then
- Sometimes

233
00:19:57,755 --> 00:20:01,050
- Say, you think we could, uh
- See each other again?

234
00:20:01,175 --> 00:20:04,178
- Yeah. Would you like that?
- Why?

235
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:07,077
I don't know... I don't
have a very good reason

236
00:20:07,078 --> 00:20:09,051
I'd just like to see you again

237
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:14,731
Where are you? I don't know
where I'm supposed to look

238
00:20:14,856 --> 00:20:19,819
<i>Bring all your dreams alive</i>

239
00:20:19,944 --> 00:20:23,614
<i>For you</i>

240
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,701
We'll see each other again.
Bye, Sonny

241
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:31,581
How'd you know my name?

242
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,210
Hey, wait a minute!
I don't know your name

243
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,713
Kira

244
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:42,258
Kira

245
00:20:48,973 --> 00:20:52,101
- I was in big trouble
- What did you do?

246
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:54,145
- Nothing
- Hi, Sonny

247
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,942
What are you doin' here?
It's early

248
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:56,914
Yeah, it's really early

249
00:20:56,939 --> 00:20:59,025
I'm workin'

250
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,904
- Well, that's wonderful
- Oh, hello there

251
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,989
Do you know you bear
a strong resemblance

252
00:21:05,073 --> 00:21:07,033
to a fellow by the name of Sonny?

253
00:21:07,158 --> 00:21:08,367
He works here

254
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:12,955
Always comes in late, though.
Say, that's pretty damn good

255
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:17,460
It is. It's too good.
That's what's wrong with it

256
00:21:17,585 --> 00:21:21,047
It is supposed to look exactly
like the album cover I gave you

257
00:21:21,172 --> 00:21:25,259
- Is that too difficult?
- If you want me to work, I'll work

258
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:28,054
If you want to argue,
I can get into that too

259
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:30,681
Don't be a wiseass, Malone

260
00:21:30,682 --> 00:21:33,184
What are you wasting all
this time on a girl for?

261
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:35,603
Because that's how she really looks

262
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,855
I don't give a damn

263
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,567
Just get it finished. 
When are you gonna have it done?

264
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:45,363
Well, I'd say it
probably will be done...

265
00:21:46,823 --> 00:21:48,700
when it's done

266
00:21:48,825 --> 00:21:50,952
But that's only an approximate guess

267
00:21:52,704 --> 00:21:57,291
Five minutes, my office.
If it's six, keep walking

268
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:02,380
Sonny, what did you do?

269
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,135
Nobody likes it, but we all
say "yes" and then forget it

270
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,013
- It goes with the job
- Four minutes

271
00:22:10,138 --> 00:22:11,535
What difference does it make?

272
00:22:11,536 --> 00:22:13,032
I'll say it's Tuesday,
he'll say it's Wednesday

273
00:22:13,057 --> 00:22:15,893
Big deal. Tell him it's Wednesday. 
What does it cost?

274
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:18,563
Oh, nothin'.
Maybe just the truth

275
00:22:18,688 --> 00:22:21,315
Just go in there and agree
with him. That's all he wants

276
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,276
You want me to say
Tuesday's Wednesday?

277
00:22:23,401 --> 00:22:26,487
- Uh-huh
- Three and a half minutes

278
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,531
All right!

279
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,535
I'll be right back

280
00:22:34,662 --> 00:22:36,873
Sit down

281
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:42,754
You think you're pretty
special around here, don't ya?

282
00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:45,715
- I never said I was special
- Well, you're not

283
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,810
I mean, you didn't discover art.
Who do you think did that?

284
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:54,807
- I did. Surprises you, doesn't it?
- No, not really

285
00:22:54,932 --> 00:22:57,143
Now I've got an office

286
00:22:57,268 --> 00:23:01,230
I make a lot of money.
People respond when I call

287
00:23:01,356 --> 00:23:04,441
That's because I smartened
up and I gave up art

288
00:23:04,965 --> 00:23:07,904
I think you made the right decision

289
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:11,824
I want you to smarten up too.
Start doing things the company way

290
00:23:11,949 --> 00:23:15,328
Sometimes I see more in these
covers than what's really there

291
00:23:15,453 --> 00:23:19,791
That's art. Just paint
what you're told to paint

292
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:22,752
If you start making changes, then
other people start making changes

293
00:23:22,877 --> 00:23:25,971
Before you know it, you got
people doing what they want to do

294
00:23:25,997 --> 00:23:28,549
That's not a company.
That's chaos

295
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:32,845
Now, I want you to hang
some of your precious covers

296
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,474
Pick up the van and hustle your
butt over to the Platinum Palace

297
00:23:39,894 --> 00:23:41,771
Tuesday's Wednesday

298
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:07,922
Hey, clarinet. How you doin'?

299
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:10,258
Hey, kid. What're
you doin' up there?

300
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:12,176
Trying to get down.
Grab ahold of the ladder

301
00:24:12,301 --> 00:24:13,074
Sure

302
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,847
We might as well
introduce ourselves

303
00:24:15,972 --> 00:24:18,516
- Sonny Malone
- Danny McGuire

304
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:21,436
Malone and McGuire.
Sounds like a vaudeville team

305
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,438
- What you got there?
- A real gem

306
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,982
- I've been waiting months for it
- Ah, Glenn Miller

307
00:24:26,107 --> 00:24:28,568
You wouldn't know about him.
He was before your time

308
00:24:28,693 --> 00:24:30,778
So was Beethoven,
but I know who he is

309
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:32,864
You like Glenn Miller?

310
00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:35,324
- You like rock'n roll?
- I love rock'n roll

311
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,744
I love Glenn Miller

312
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,418
This place is incredible

313
00:24:45,543 --> 00:24:51,257
It belonged to a silent movie star.
They did things big in those days

314
00:24:51,382 --> 00:24:53,426
What do you do with
all this space?

315
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:55,470
Nothing really

316
00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:58,389
This room makes
my records sound great

317
00:24:58,473 --> 00:25:01,809
I've only got one thing to say:
Remember, I gave you some popcorn

318
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:06,230
Okay. But you came here
to listen to Glenn Miller

319
00:25:06,356 --> 00:25:09,150
All set up. There he goes

320
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:13,780
Nothing like that sound.
That sound was a miracle

321
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:16,574
- Hey, Danny, that's you
- Yeah

322
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:20,244
This girl. Danny, there's this girl

323
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,246
Shh, listen

324
00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:25,583
That's me

325
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:29,087
Hey, that's all right.
You got any more surprises?

326
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,633
This is what I call my
memorabilia room

327
00:25:33,634 --> 00:25:36,386
The story of Danny McGuire

328
00:25:36,511 --> 00:25:38,971
Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman...
You really knew those guys?

329
00:25:39,097 --> 00:25:41,307
We used to hang out together

330
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:42,885
After I toured with Miller

331
00:25:42,886 --> 00:25:46,979
I got my own band and my
own club. West 51 st Street

332
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:49,816
It was small and jam-packed

333
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:52,235
Everybody in town would drop by

334
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,321
Sometimes they'd sit in
for a set or two

335
00:25:55,446 --> 00:25:58,074
Now it's a parking lot

336
00:26:00,368 --> 00:26:02,912
- Why did you give it up?
- Oh, it was one of those

337
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:06,874
turning points where you
turn in the wrong direction

338
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:09,877
- It was a girl
- The girl in the album

339
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,797
Yeah

340
00:26:14,465 --> 00:26:16,634
The singer with the band

341
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:20,805
When she left,
I figured she'd be back

342
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,933
I wasn't about to run
after her, right?

343
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:28,771
Hmm! Boy, did I teach her a lesson

344
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:31,524
Never saw her again

345
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:34,902
After that, the heart
went outta my music

346
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:36,904
I went into the family
construction business

347
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,991
and became what
they call "comfortable"

348
00:26:40,116 --> 00:26:41,993
Three cheers for comfort

349
00:26:42,118 --> 00:26:43,995
You ever think about
going back into music?

350
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:49,459
Oh, only about 20
or 30 times a day

351
00:26:49,584 --> 00:26:51,586
So, you gonna do it?

352
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:54,505
Well, I can't play clarinet
like I did in the old days

353
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,549
But you know something?

354
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,468
I'd love to open up
another joint again

355
00:26:58,551 --> 00:27:00,470
Why don't you?

356
00:27:00,553 --> 00:27:02,513
I've had real estate agents
looking for two years

357
00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:04,515
They can't find the right place

358
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,769
If it's just a place you want,
that seems pretty easy

359
00:27:07,894 --> 00:27:09,812
No, it's not easy.
It's like falling in love

360
00:27:09,937 --> 00:27:13,399
You gotta feel a special attachment

361
00:27:13,524 --> 00:27:15,735
- Like you and your friend
- Kira

362
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,989
Kira Hey, why don't you
help me look?

363
00:27:20,114 --> 00:27:22,075
Maybe you can
come up with something

364
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,786
- Me?
- Sure. You've got a good eye

365
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:28,748
- Stranger things have happened
- Yeah, I guess they have

366
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:31,959
- Listen, I gotta go
- I understand

367
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:35,088
- I'll let myself out?
- Sure

368
00:27:35,213 --> 00:27:38,466
So long. See you around

369
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,723
Now how'd that kid
figure out about us?

370
00:27:45,848 --> 00:27:49,185
<i>You made me feel so bad</i>

371
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,896
I guess it still shows on me

372
00:27:53,898 --> 00:27:59,529
<i>You made me sigh for you</i>

373
00:27:59,654 --> 00:28:02,073
<i>I didn't wanna tell ya</i>

374
00:28:02,198 --> 00:28:03,984
You're gettin' old, boy

375
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:07,370
<i>Didn't wanna tell ya</i>

376
00:28:07,495 --> 00:28:08,225
I'm gettin' old, babe

377
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:09,956
<i>I want some love</i>

378
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:11,428
You wouldn't even know me now

379
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:13,376
<i>That's true</i>

380
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:15,211
<i>Yes, I do, indeed I do</i>

381
00:28:15,212 --> 00:28:16,921
But I'd know you

382
00:28:17,046 --> 00:28:20,508
<i>You know I do</i>

383
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:22,718
<i>Gimme, gimme</i>

384
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:23,845
Yes

385
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,042
<i>What I cry for</i>

386
00:28:25,043 --> 00:28:26,514
I'd certainly know you

387
00:28:26,597 --> 00:28:28,516
<i>You know you've got</i>

388
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:29,630
I remember

389
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:31,019
<i>The kind of kisses</i>

390
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:32,216
<i>That I'd die for</i>

391
00:28:32,217 --> 00:28:33,688
everything

392
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:36,336
Oh-ho

393
00:28:36,337 --> 00:28:37,358
<i>You know</i>

394
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:39,239
How I remember it

395
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,196
<i>You made me</i>

396
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:48,453
<i>Love you</i>

397
00:28:57,712 --> 00:29:04,719
<i>No other face could
take you off my mind</i>

398
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:09,474
<i>You're so refined</i>

399
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,478
<i>You're much too kind</i>

400
00:29:13,603 --> 00:29:16,731
<i>I have to warn you</i>

401
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:21,402
<i>I'm never gonna set you free</i>

402
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:24,572
<i>'Cause I was born to</i>

403
00:29:24,697 --> 00:29:30,453
<i>Love you for eternity</i>

404
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:37,585
<i>Whenever you're away from me</i>

405
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,547
<i>Wherever you go</i>

406
00:29:41,631 --> 00:29:45,510
<i>You're never far away from me</i>

407
00:29:45,635 --> 00:29:50,306
<i>I want you to know</i>

408
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:54,352
<i>I only have to close
my eyes, dear</i>

409
00:29:54,477 --> 00:29:58,272
<i>And suddenly I'm where you are</i>

410
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:00,274
<i>You better never stray</i>

411
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,445
<i>'Cause I'll never be far away</i>

412
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:22,505
<i>On every breeze I seem
to hear your name</i>

413
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,968
<i>My heart's to blame</i>

414
00:30:28,845 --> 00:30:32,557
<i>I feel the same</i>

415
00:30:32,682 --> 00:30:35,810
<i>I'd fall apart, dear</i>

416
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:40,523
<i>If you'd let the feelin' end</i>

417
00:30:40,648 --> 00:30:43,818
<i>Don't break a heart, dear</i>

418
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:48,540
<i>Nobody else could mend</i>

419
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:52,660
<i>Whenever you're away from me</i>

420
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:56,706
<i>Wherever you go</i>

421
00:30:56,789 --> 00:31:00,668
<i>You're never far away from me</i>

422
00:31:00,752 --> 00:31:05,673
<i>I want you to know</i>

423
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:09,594
<i>I only have to close
my eyes, dear</i>

424
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:13,598
<i>And suddenly I'm where you are</i>

425
00:31:13,723 --> 00:31:15,600
<i>You better never stray</i>

426
00:31:15,725 --> 00:31:20,772
<i>'Cause I'll never be far away</i>

427
00:32:51,112 --> 00:32:53,031
<i>You better never stray</i>

428
00:32:53,114 --> 00:32:59,120
<i>'Cause I'll never be far</i>

429
00:32:59,245 --> 00:33:08,838
<i>A way</i>

430
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:11,401
- Hello. Oh, I'm sorry
- Hey! You scared the hell outta me

431
00:34:11,526 --> 00:34:15,029
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I tried to be quiet

432
00:34:15,113 --> 00:34:17,990
- How long you been standin' there?
- Just a few seconds

433
00:34:18,074 --> 00:34:20,076
- Should I go?
- No, stay

434
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:22,120
You paint beautifully

435
00:34:22,245 --> 00:34:24,038
This is the first time
I've cared about

436
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:25,832
what I've painted in a long time

437
00:34:25,957 --> 00:34:29,627
It's a shame. It must be frustrating
to waste your talents on things

438
00:34:29,711 --> 00:34:33,047
- that don't really matter to you
- Yeah

439
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:36,467
I met a guy. He told me
I should take long lunch hours

440
00:34:36,551 --> 00:34:40,805
- A guy?
- Someone I met at the beach

441
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:43,474
He's got this crazy
idea to build a club

442
00:34:43,558 --> 00:34:45,601
He asked me if
I'd help him find a place

443
00:34:45,727 --> 00:34:47,979
All the real estate agents
in this town, he asks me

444
00:34:48,104 --> 00:34:51,315
That's not a crazy idea.
You've got a good eye

445
00:34:51,441 --> 00:34:53,484
That's what he said

446
00:34:54,527 --> 00:34:59,157
If it's a place you want, what about
this one? My place, where we met

447
00:34:59,282 --> 00:35:01,200
That? Forget it

448
00:35:01,325 --> 00:35:04,120
I think it has a very
special aura about it

449
00:35:04,245 --> 00:35:06,789
It's a dump!

450
00:35:06,914 --> 00:35:09,208
You're supposed to be an
artist. Use your imagination

451
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,627
Thanks, I'm all out

452
00:35:11,711 --> 00:35:14,213
You know, I really think
you believe that

453
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:17,258
I've had enough for tonight

454
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:20,219
- Come on, let's get out of here
- Okay

455
00:35:24,307 --> 00:35:26,309
- What's this?
- Shh, be quiet

456
00:35:26,392 --> 00:35:28,311
I thought we were going skating

457
00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:30,980
I wanna show you
the special studio first

458
00:35:31,105 --> 00:35:35,026
Only the biggest groups
get to record here

459
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:37,820
- It's really kinda magic
- Hmm?

460
00:35:37,945 --> 00:35:40,239
They flash all sorts
of pictures on screens

461
00:35:40,365 --> 00:35:42,283
Really? Can we see it?

462
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:45,286
Straight ahead

463
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:48,790
But pictures in a
recording studio? Why?

464
00:35:48,915 --> 00:35:52,794
- For inspiration
- Oh, inspiration. Sounds perfect

465
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:55,580
I've only watched them do this
a couple of times before

466
00:35:55,615 --> 00:35:58,549
Let's see. Turn on
that one. And this

467
00:35:58,633 --> 00:36:00,510
I don't know how to make
the whole thing work

468
00:36:00,635 --> 00:36:02,637
- Press 'em all
- I don't wanna break it

469
00:36:02,762 --> 00:36:04,806
- Press them carefully!
- What the hell

470
00:36:04,931 --> 00:36:07,016
I didn't like the job anyway

471
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:09,018
Let's see

472
00:36:09,143 --> 00:36:11,187
Now will we see the magic?

473
00:36:11,437 --> 00:36:13,606
Sure. Come on

474
00:36:13,731 --> 00:36:15,608
Careful

475
00:36:21,948 --> 00:36:24,951
<i>She walks in</i>

476
00:36:25,034 --> 00:36:29,789
<i>And I'm suddenly a hero</i>

477
00:36:29,872 --> 00:36:32,250
<i>I'm taken in</i>

478
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:37,630
<i>My hopes begin to rise</i>

479
00:36:41,426 --> 00:36:44,887
<i>Look at me</i>

480
00:36:45,013 --> 00:36:52,145
<i>Can't you tell I'd be
so thrilled to see</i>

481
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,439
<i>- The message in your eyes
- You make it seem</i>

482
00:36:54,564 --> 00:36:56,482
<i>I'm so close to my dream</i>

483
00:36:56,607 --> 00:36:59,402
<i>And then suddenly it's all right</i>

484
00:36:59,527 --> 00:37:04,282
<i>Suddenly the wheels
are in motion</i>

485
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:06,951
<i>And I</i>

486
00:37:07,035 --> 00:37:11,664
<i>I'm ready to sail any ocean</i>

487
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:16,377
<i>Suddenly I don't
need the answers</i>

488
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:19,088
<i>'Cause I</i>

489
00:37:19,213 --> 00:37:26,596
<i>I'm ready to take
all my chances with you</i>

490
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:43,404
<i>And how can I</i>

491
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:46,908
<i>Feel you're all that matters</i>

492
00:37:46,991 --> 00:37:55,458
<i>I'd rely on anything you say</i>

493
00:37:59,045 --> 00:38:02,674
<i>I'll take care</i>

494
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:06,386
<i>That no illusions shatter</i>

495
00:38:06,511 --> 00:38:11,182
<i>If you dare say
what you should say</i>

496
00:38:11,307 --> 00:38:14,060
<i>You make it seem
I'm so close to my dream</i>

497
00:38:14,185 --> 00:38:17,405
<i>And then suddenly it's all right</i>

498
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:21,567
<i>Suddenly the wheels
are in motion</i>

499
00:38:21,693 --> 00:38:24,237
<i>And I</i>

500
00:38:24,362 --> 00:38:29,200
<i>I'm ready to sail any ocean</i>

501
00:38:29,325 --> 00:38:33,871
<i>Suddenly I don't
need the answers</i>

502
00:38:33,996 --> 00:38:36,582
<i>'Cause I</i>

503
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:44,799
<i>I'm ready to take
all my chances with you</i>

504
00:38:58,896 --> 00:39:03,359
<i>Why do I feel so alive</i>

505
00:39:03,484 --> 00:39:05,361
<i>When you're near</i>

506
00:39:05,486 --> 00:39:08,614
<i>There's no way any hurt</i>

507
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,869
<i>Can get through</i>

508
00:39:12,952 --> 00:39:19,250
<i>Longin' to spend
every moment of the day</i>

509
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:23,046
<i>With you</i>

510
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:27,342
<i>With you</i>

511
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:31,971
<i>Suddenly the wheels
are in motion</i>

512
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,766
<i>And I</i>

513
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:39,645
<i>I'm ready to sail any ocean</i>

514
00:39:39,771 --> 00:39:44,275
<i>Suddenly I don't
need the answers</i>

515
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,070
<i>'Cause I</i>

516
00:39:47,195 --> 00:39:55,161
<i>I'm ready to take
all my chances with you</i>

517
00:39:55,286 --> 00:39:59,707
<i>Ah-ah-ah-ah</i>

518
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:03,002
Hey! What the hell's
goin' on in here?

519
00:40:03,127 --> 00:40:05,004
Malone! Is that you?

520
00:40:05,129 --> 00:40:06,039
Yes!

521
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,549
No, it's not me.
It's somebody else

522
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:12,136
Do you have any idea how much
this equipment costs? Huh?

523
00:40:12,261 --> 00:40:14,347
- Oh, shit!

524
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,432
- That was great
- You were great

525
00:40:16,557 --> 00:40:18,935
Our first dance together

526
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,646
Followed by our first
being-kicked-out together

527
00:40:21,771 --> 00:40:23,815
- Now I want to go somewhere else
- Where?

528
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,817
Find out more about you

529
00:40:27,193 --> 00:40:30,196
You know enough about me.
I wanna know about you

530
00:40:30,321 --> 00:40:34,242
- I'm serious
- So am I

531
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:37,328
After all that, do you think you'd
let your imagination roam a little?

532
00:40:37,453 --> 00:40:40,873
I won't even
start in on that one

533
00:40:40,998 --> 00:40:43,292
What are you doin'?

534
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:46,045
- What do you think you're doin'?
- Oh, nothing

535
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:51,884
Oh, ha. Well, well, well.
What a coincidence

536
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:54,053
Look where we
just happened to end up

537
00:40:55,555 --> 00:40:57,682
- You think you're
clever, don't you?

538
00:40:57,807 --> 00:41:03,187
I just didn't want you to close
your eyes to any possibilities

539
00:41:03,271 --> 00:41:05,481
You really think this
could work out for Danny?

540
00:41:05,606 --> 00:41:10,111
I think this place could be
anything you want it to be

541
00:41:10,236 --> 00:41:14,198
See, it's simple.
Your friend has a dream

542
00:41:14,323 --> 00:41:18,286
and you want to be involved in
something you really believe in

543
00:41:18,411 --> 00:41:22,498
Maybe his dream is big
enough for the both of you

544
00:41:22,623 --> 00:41:26,169
So here we are. Someone who believes
that dreams come easy, and...

545
00:41:26,294 --> 00:41:29,756
Someone who doesn't know
what they believe in

546
00:41:29,881 --> 00:41:33,593
So just think about it, okay?
Just think about it

547
00:41:46,606 --> 00:41:50,818
You gotta be kidding. This place?
They used to have wrestling here

548
00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:53,154
It's got a history of success

549
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:55,990
It needs some fixin' up.
It could look terrific

550
00:41:56,115 --> 00:41:58,117
So could the Titanic

551
00:41:58,242 --> 00:42:01,829
Kid, you don't need a builder.
You need a demolition team

552
00:42:01,913 --> 00:42:04,624
I know it's a wreck now, but I
can see it coming to life again

553
00:42:04,749 --> 00:42:06,751
Just check it out, Danny

554
00:42:06,876 --> 00:42:09,671
- What put you onto this?
- A girl

555
00:42:09,796 --> 00:42:13,174
Oh, that explains everything

556
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:16,064
Hey, Danny, don't you think
there's a certain kind of...

557
00:42:16,365 --> 00:42:18,429
aura about this place?

558
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:21,474
Well, if that's what you call it,
it's got it all right

559
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,935
Let's see the rest of it

560
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:27,271
Course, it's not small and
intimate like my club in New York

561
00:42:27,397 --> 00:42:32,777
But then again, that was back
in 1945 and things are bigger now

562
00:42:32,902 --> 00:42:36,531
And this place. Whoo! Sure is big

563
00:42:36,656 --> 00:42:40,326
- Yeah, it is
- Well, I don't know

564
00:42:40,451 --> 00:42:44,122
Naturally, I can't take
all this too seriously

565
00:42:44,247 --> 00:42:48,418
But if I were going to do
something. And I can't say I am

566
00:42:48,543 --> 00:42:53,548
I'm a builder and a builder has to
take his time deciding these things

567
00:42:53,631 --> 00:42:56,634
If I were going to do
something about it

568
00:42:56,759 --> 00:43:01,055
speaking hypothetically,
it just might work

569
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:05,893
- You think so?
- Might. If I planned it right

570
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:08,980
Let's see, uh.
Stage over there

571
00:43:09,105 --> 00:43:12,692
Stairs there and there
and back there

572
00:43:12,817 --> 00:43:14,944
- Can you imagine it?
- Imagine what?

573
00:43:15,069 --> 00:43:17,030
A bandstand right over
there in that corner

574
00:43:17,155 --> 00:43:19,615
<i>And a big band,
like in the '40s</i>

575
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:29,542
No. Bandstands went out
with running boards. Over there

576
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:33,046
<i>A great rock 'n' roll band.
This is the '80s</i>

577
00:43:39,344 --> 00:43:42,513
Real smooth dancers...
Wild trombone

578
00:43:42,638 --> 00:43:46,142
The band decked out in tuxedos

579
00:43:51,647 --> 00:43:53,365
Six guys wearin' electric orange...

580
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,944
Synthesizer, heavy
percussion, electric guitar...

581
00:44:04,702 --> 00:44:08,289
Lots of glamour. Everybody
dressed in elegance and style

582
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,240
<i>Do it, Daddy, do it</i>

583
00:45:24,282 --> 00:45:26,534
<i>Anybody blue</i>

584
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:31,622
<i>Anybody needin' someone too</i>

585
00:45:31,748 --> 00:45:36,544
<i>Anyone feelin' cold</i>

586
00:45:36,669 --> 00:45:42,550
<i>No one there you can hold</i>

587
00:45:42,633 --> 00:45:44,510
<i>Don't wait to get old and grey</i>

588
00:45:44,635 --> 00:45:47,138
<i>I'm gonna blow
all the clouds away</i>

589
00:45:47,263 --> 00:45:50,892
<i>'Cause there is nothing
I would rather do</i>

590
00:45:51,017 --> 00:45:54,062
<i>Ooo-ooo-ooo</i>

591
00:45:54,187 --> 00:45:58,900
<i>Forget about the blues
tonight. Sweet thing</i>

592
00:45:59,025 --> 00:46:04,781
<i>Forget about the rules tonight.
Sweet thing</i>

593
00:46:04,906 --> 00:46:06,783
<i>I want to dance with you</i>

594
00:46:06,908 --> 00:46:09,160
<i>Until the sun comes
creepin' through</i>

595
00:46:09,285 --> 00:46:12,080
<i>I want to dance with you</i>

596
00:46:12,205 --> 00:46:14,666
<i>I won't stop pleasin' you</i>

597
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:19,003
<i>Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh</i>

598
00:46:19,128 --> 00:46:21,464
<i>Honey, for a while</i>

599
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:26,135
<i>Give a girl a chance
to show some style</i>

600
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:31,474
<i>If you've got no love to spare</i>

601
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,976
<i>Tell me lies</i>

602
00:46:34,102 --> 00:46:36,729
<i>I don't care</i>

603
00:46:36,854 --> 00:46:39,941
<i>You better believe that I</i>

604
00:46:40,066 --> 00:46:42,068
<i>Know some moves
that we've gotta try</i>

605
00:46:42,151 --> 00:46:45,738
<i>'Cause there is nothing
I would rather do</i>

606
00:46:45,863 --> 00:46:49,242
<i>Ooo-ooo-hey</i>

607
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:53,871
<i>Forget about the blues tonight.
Sweet thing</i>

608
00:46:53,996 --> 00:46:59,168
<i>Forget about the rules tonight.
Sweet thing</i>

609
00:46:59,293 --> 00:47:01,671
<i>I want to dance with you</i>

610
00:47:01,796 --> 00:47:04,215
<i>Until the sun comes
creepin' through</i>

611
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,884
<i>I want to dance with you</i>

612
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:09,429
<i>I won't stop pleasin' you</i>

613
00:47:09,512 --> 00:47:14,350
<i>Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh</i>

614
00:47:24,902 --> 00:47:27,780
<i>Lover, I wanna let you know</i>

615
00:47:27,905 --> 00:47:29,782
<i>I won't take a backseat</i>

616
00:47:29,907 --> 00:47:33,036
<i>Ain't willin' to let you go</i>

617
00:47:33,161 --> 00:47:35,288
<i>I won't take a backseat</i>

618
00:47:35,413 --> 00:47:37,373
<i>Don't wanna hear what you want</i>

619
00:47:37,498 --> 00:47:39,834
<i>It's gotta be all my way</i>

620
00:47:39,959 --> 00:47:42,712
<i>And I'm makin' sure
you stay to see</i>

621
00:47:44,797 --> 00:47:47,425
<i>I'm really a selfish man</i>

622
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:49,969
<i>I gotta get right to it</i>

623
00:47:50,094 --> 00:47:53,973
<i>Lover, tonight
I'm thinkin' of me</i>

624
00:47:54,098 --> 00:47:59,645
<i>Lover, I won't take a
backseat tonight. Ooo-ooo-ooo</i>

625
00:47:59,771 --> 00:48:05,526
<i>Lover, gettin' on my
two feet tonight. Ooo-ooo-ooo</i>

626
00:48:05,651 --> 00:48:07,570
<i>Got some dancin' to do</i>

627
00:48:07,695 --> 00:48:09,739
<i>Got some dancin' to do</i>

628
00:48:09,864 --> 00:48:12,700
<i>Got some dancin' to do</i>

629
00:48:12,825 --> 00:48:15,036
<i>Got some dancin' to do</i>

630
00:48:25,213 --> 00:48:27,882
<i>Can't let anyone dance with you</i>

631
00:48:28,007 --> 00:48:29,884
<i>I won't take a backseat</i>

632
00:48:30,009 --> 00:48:32,929
<i>Let me show you what I can do</i>

633
00:48:33,054 --> 00:48:34,931
<i>I won't take a backseat</i>

634
00:48:35,056 --> 00:48:37,350
<i>Ain't funny to fool with me</i>

635
00:48:37,475 --> 00:48:39,852
<i>I'll be a bad loser</i>

636
00:48:39,977 --> 00:48:44,065
<i>You're gettin' me mad.
Usin' me</i>

637
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:47,694
<i>Tried puttin' a spell on me</i>

638
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:49,570
<i>'Cause I had a strange feelin'</i>

639
00:48:49,696 --> 00:48:54,283
<i>You better get down
to healin' me</i>

640
00:48:54,409 --> 00:49:00,039
<i>Lover, I won't take a
backseat tonight. Ooo-ooo-ooo</i>

641
00:49:00,164 --> 00:49:05,211

two feet tonight. Ooo-ooo-ooo</i>

642
00:49:05,336 --> 00:49:06,921
<i>Got some dancin' to do</i>

643
00:49:07,046 --> 00:49:09,716
<i>- Got some dancin' to do

644
00:49:09,841 --> 00:49:12,885

646
00:49:19,851 --> 00:49:23,396
<i>Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh</i>

647
00:49:23,521 --> 00:49:25,481
<i>- Forget about the blues
- Lover</i>

648
00:49:25,606 --> 00:49:28,568
<i>I won't take a backseat tonight</i>

649
00:49:28,693 --> 00:49:30,611
<i>- Forget about the blues

650
00:49:30,737 --> 00:49:34,115
<i>Gettin' on my two feet tonight</i>

651
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,492
<i>- I want to dance with you

652
00:49:36,617 --> 00:49:38,828
<i>Until the sun comes
creepin' through</i>

653
00:49:38,911 --> 00:49:41,622
<i>- I want to dance with you
- Got some dancin' to do</i>

654
00:49:41,748 --> 00:49:43,624
<i>- I won't stop pleasin' you
- Got some dancin' to do</i>

655
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,626
<i>- Forget about the blues
- Lover</i>

656
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,546
<i>I won't take a backseat tonight</i>

657
00:49:48,629 --> 00:49:50,548
<i>- Forget about the blues
- Lover</i>

658
00:49:50,631 --> 00:49:53,634
<i>Gettin' on my two feet tonight</i>

659
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,095
<i>- I want to dance with you
- Got some dancin' to do</i>

660
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,431
<i>Until the sun comes
creepin' through</i>

661
00:49:58,556 --> 00:50:01,225
<i>- I want to dance with you
- Got some dancin' to do</i>

662
00:50:01,351 --> 00:50:03,936
<i>- I won't stop pleasin' you
- Got some dancin' to do</i>

663
00:50:04,062 --> 00:50:09,317
<i>Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey</i>

664
00:50:09,859 --> 00:50:12,111
I love it!
I'll do it!

665
00:50:12,236 --> 00:50:14,822
Maybe I'm crazy, but what the hell!

666
00:50:14,823 --> 00:50:17,408
I haven't been crazy
for over 35 years

667
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:19,681
And, kid, I'm giving you
half the place

668
00:50:19,682 --> 00:50:21,829
You're gonna be my partner

669
00:50:21,913 --> 00:50:23,790
I can't do that, Danny.
I can't take that

670
00:50:23,915 --> 00:50:25,792
Why?

671
00:50:25,917 --> 00:50:28,127
I don't know the first thing
about being a partner

672
00:50:28,252 --> 00:50:32,548
It's easy. We share the
responsibilities and we argue a lot

673
00:50:32,632 --> 00:50:35,927
It's like being married
without the good part

674
00:50:36,052 --> 00:50:39,347
- Come on, kid. Is it a deal?

675
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,891
- Okay It's a deal
- What do you know!

676
00:50:42,016 --> 00:50:44,394
I'm back in show business

677
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:48,231
I can't wait. I gotta look over
every inch of this place

678
00:50:48,356 --> 00:50:50,942
- I wish we could see better
- I got a flashlight in the car

679
00:50:51,025 --> 00:50:53,111
- Will you get it?
- Yeah

680
00:50:53,194 --> 00:50:55,947
Our first collaboration as partners

681
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:59,951
Oh, partner?
Partner, what'll we name the place?

682
00:51:05,456 --> 00:51:09,961
Yeah. What, what
the hell to call it?

683
00:51:12,505 --> 00:51:17,343
<i><b>"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan,
a stately pleasure dome decree:"</b></i>

684
00:51:21,305 --> 00:51:23,850
<i><b>"Where Alph,
the sacred river, ran</b></i>

685
00:51:23,933 --> 00:51:26,644
<i><b>through caverns
measureless to man"</b></i>

686
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:29,939
<i><b>"Down to a sunless sea"</b></i>

687
00:51:30,064 --> 00:51:32,150
Yes, Xanadu

688
00:51:32,233 --> 00:51:35,028
- I'm Kira
- Of course

689
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:37,697
You're Kira

690
00:51:37,822 --> 00:51:39,907
- But, uh
- But?

691
00:51:39,991 --> 00:51:42,952
I mean... don't I know you?

692
00:51:43,077 --> 00:51:46,414
I don't think so

693
00:51:47,874 --> 00:51:51,210
- Are you sure because...
- Because?

694
00:51:51,336 --> 00:51:55,340
Well, I mean... I don't know.
I was thinking that I ge...

695
00:51:55,465 --> 00:51:57,842
Oh, I'm sorry. Forget it

696
00:51:59,677 --> 00:52:02,305
So you're gonna do it?

697
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,307
Yes, we-we're gonna do it

698
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:07,560
- Total insanity
- Only if you think so

699
00:52:07,685 --> 00:52:12,065
Well, even if it is,
it's worth a try

700
00:52:13,566 --> 00:52:17,695
Xanadu... How do you think
that'll look on a marquee?

701
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:21,074
- Mmm, wonderful
- Hey!

702
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:24,452
- When did you get here?
- Just a minute ago

703
00:52:24,577 --> 00:52:25,516
What'd I tell you, Danny?

704
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,456
One minute she's here, the
next minute, who knows?

705
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:31,395
Guess what you
own half of, partner

706
00:52:31,396 --> 00:52:32,210
What?

707
00:52:32,335 --> 00:52:34,545
Xanadu

708
00:52:34,671 --> 00:52:37,548
- Xanadu
- Xanadu

709
00:52:38,925 --> 00:52:40,802
Hi, guys

710
00:52:40,927 --> 00:52:43,221
- Hey, Picasso
- Hey

711
00:52:43,346 --> 00:52:45,807
How ya doin'?

712
00:52:46,974 --> 00:52:50,687
Let's see, what's first
on the agenda?

713
00:52:50,812 --> 00:52:55,108
- Who are you calling?
- Leave a dime on the counter

714
00:52:55,191 --> 00:52:57,819
- Hello, Simpson? Sonny Malone

715
00:52:57,944 --> 00:53:00,905
- I wanna see you right away
- What's goin' on here?

716
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:03,950
Who cares? Just get out
before he gets here

717
00:53:04,075 --> 00:53:05,952
I'll fix everything up.
I'll tell him it was a joke

718
00:53:06,077 --> 00:53:08,329
- Wait a minute. Relax
- Are you loaded?

719
00:53:08,454 --> 00:53:10,623
When you sober up,
you're gonna be sorry

720
00:53:10,748 --> 00:53:14,752
- He should be coming in about now
- Malone, what the hell is goin' on?

721
00:53:14,877 --> 00:53:18,840
Simpson, I've worked like a dog
tryin' to make Tuesday Wednesday

722
00:53:18,965 --> 00:53:22,260
I couldn't do it.
I must be a failure

723
00:53:23,803 --> 00:53:24,796
Is he straight?

724
00:53:24,797 --> 00:53:27,390
You told me if I didn't
do things right, I'd be fired

725
00:53:27,515 --> 00:53:30,518
- Well, you were right
- Huh?

726
00:53:30,643 --> 00:53:32,687
I'm fired!

727
00:53:32,812 --> 00:53:35,481
Malone, I want you
out of here in five minutes

728
00:53:35,606 --> 00:53:36,775
That's five minutes, Malone

729
00:53:36,776 --> 00:53:39,944
and if it's six, just
keep walking. Got it?

730
00:53:40,069 --> 00:53:42,780
I'm doin' it I'm doin' it
I'm doin' it!

731
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:44,782
You know that dream of
mine to get out of here?

732
00:53:44,907 --> 00:53:46,763
It's happening,
and you're all invited

733
00:53:46,764 --> 00:53:48,619
Opening night, whatever you want

734
00:53:48,745 --> 00:53:50,997
it's on the house

735
00:53:51,122 --> 00:53:53,750
You know, I always
wanted to say that line

736
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:01,591
Shit

737
00:54:08,139 --> 00:54:11,100
Okay

738
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,645
- To Xanadu
- To dreams

739
00:54:14,771 --> 00:54:17,607
I couldn't have done it without you

740
00:54:18,733 --> 00:54:21,194
- How is it?
- Heavenly

741
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:23,780
You're the one
that's heavenly

742
00:54:25,907 --> 00:54:27,950
No, don't

743
00:54:28,034 --> 00:54:31,328
What's the matter?
Did I do something?

744
00:54:31,329 --> 00:54:32,622
No

745
00:54:32,747 --> 00:54:35,124
You know, I don't know
anything about you

746
00:54:35,249 --> 00:54:37,210
Where you live,
where you were born

747
00:54:37,335 --> 00:54:39,212
There's nothing to know

748
00:54:39,337 --> 00:54:41,881
- Where do you live?
- With my sisters

749
00:54:41,964 --> 00:54:44,425
- Where?
- In an apartment

750
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:47,595
- Yeah, but where's the apartment?
- On the second floor

751
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,972
Look, I don't even know
how to find you

752
00:54:50,098 --> 00:54:53,059
- Yeah, but you always do
- Okay

753
00:54:53,184 --> 00:54:55,228
That's a dead end

754
00:54:55,311 --> 00:54:58,064
- What's your last name?
- Same as my father's and mother's

755
00:54:58,189 --> 00:55:01,275
- Yeah, but what is it?
- What? My father's or my mother's?

756
00:55:01,401 --> 00:55:04,112
- I don't care. Either one
- Same as mine

757
00:55:04,237 --> 00:55:06,906
Okay, I get it. No questions

758
00:55:06,989 --> 00:55:11,369
- No questions, no lies
- No questions, no truth either

759
00:55:11,494 --> 00:55:13,329
Listen, you know
enough about me already

760
00:55:13,454 --> 00:55:15,999
Any more, you're
gonna get a headache

761
00:55:16,082 --> 00:55:19,877
- Are you living with somebody?
- Yes

762
00:55:20,003 --> 00:55:24,090
I'm living with my sisters.
I told you already

763
00:55:24,215 --> 00:55:27,468
Yeah, I know, in an
apartment on the second floor

764
00:55:49,991 --> 00:55:53,786
<i>Why do I say</i>

765
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:57,498
<i>Don't walk away</i>

766
00:55:57,623 --> 00:56:01,377
<i>You'll be the way
you were before</i>

767
00:56:01,502 --> 00:56:05,214
<i>When you don't
want me any more</i>

768
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,925
<i>Don't turn around</i>

769
00:56:09,344 --> 00:56:11,929
<i>Don't ever leave</i>

770
00:56:13,181 --> 00:56:16,642
<i>A lonely room where empty days</i>

771
00:56:16,768 --> 00:56:20,229
<i>Are gathering to meet me</i>

772
00:56:20,355 --> 00:56:22,440
<i>When you're gone</i>

773
00:56:22,565 --> 00:56:24,442

but we're not gonna do
any of that celebrity stuff

Anybody who shows up. Okay,
we'll see you tomorrow. So long

884
01:03:38,251 --> 01:03:41,921
I wonder what would have happened
if I got that al bum to paint?

885
01:03:42,046 --> 01:03:44,590
Don't worry.
Your turn will come

888
01:03:51,806 --> 01:03:54,434
All right, what's next, boss?

889
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:57,812
Well, we're down to little details.
Fountains, yes

890
01:03:57,937 --> 01:04:01,566
The mirrors, yes. Uh, next,
we need those new parking signs

891
01:04:01,691 --> 01:04:04,235
The signs are here.
We haven't put them up yet

892
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:06,821
Let's get' em up. I'll be
right back. I wanna talk to you

893
01:04:06,946 --> 01:04:09,657
- about the sound system
- Sure

894
01:04:09,782 --> 01:04:11,367
You've made the place
look beautiful

895
01:04:11,368 --> 01:04:12,952
Just did what the kid said

896
01:04:13,077 --> 01:04:16,080
Oh, I see a little Danny
McGuire here and there

897
01:04:16,205 --> 01:04:19,834
Oh, just here and there.
Don't tell anybody, but...

898
01:04:19,959 --> 01:04:22,920
- I'm nervous
- What about?

899
01:04:23,046 --> 01:04:27,633
Well, I haven't had an
opening night since, uh, 1945

900
01:04:27,759 --> 01:04:30,345
Wow! I guess I got the jitters

901
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:33,264
Well, just pretend we're
back in 1945 all over again

902
01:04:33,389 --> 01:04:36,476
I don't have to pretend

903
01:04:36,601 --> 01:04:40,563
It is 1945 all over again

904
01:04:41,814 --> 01:04:44,567
Well, that takes care of that

905
01:04:44,692 --> 01:04:46,861
Sonny, don't worry
about that sound system

906
01:04:46,986 --> 01:04:49,238
I looked over it
twice today and it's fine

907
01:04:49,364 --> 01:04:51,866
You kids go on home

908
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:56,996
Bye, Danny

909
01:05:04,379 --> 01:05:07,715
You did it. Tomorrow's your big
day. It's all gonna come true

910
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,177
Tomorrow's gonna be the most
beautiful day in the world

911
01:05:11,302 --> 01:05:13,346
Kira

912
01:05:14,347 --> 01:05:16,557
I love you

913
01:05:16,683 --> 01:05:19,018
I love you, Sonny

914
01:05:25,149 --> 01:05:29,779
- What's the matter?
- All of it everything

915
01:05:29,904 --> 01:05:32,240
We can't go on pretending
this is for real

916
01:05:32,365 --> 01:05:34,534
I know, it is hard to believe

917
01:05:34,659 --> 01:05:37,787
Oh, I can't have
these kind of feelings

918
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:39,310
It's beginning to hurt...

919
01:05:39,611 --> 01:05:42,750
Oh, this part of it was
never supposed to happen

920
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:45,086
I don't understand

921
01:05:46,462 --> 01:05:48,715
What do you mean, "hurt"?

922
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:53,261
I know... I shouldn't but
I do, and it's crazy

923
01:05:53,386 --> 01:05:56,264
Sonny, there's something
I have to tell you about myself

924
01:05:56,389 --> 01:05:59,767
- I know all I need to know
- I have to tell you. I have no choice

925
01:05:59,892 --> 01:06:03,479
All I was sent to do
was to make Xanadu happen

926
01:06:03,604 --> 01:06:05,481
I don't get it

927
01:06:05,606 --> 01:06:07,567
Sonny, you have to
believe me when I tell you

928
01:06:07,692 --> 01:06:09,569
that I never wanted to hurt you

929
01:06:09,694 --> 01:06:13,781
That was the last thing
I wanted to happen

930
01:06:13,906 --> 01:06:16,826
I'm not as I appear to you

931
01:06:16,909 --> 01:06:19,704
Have you ever heard the
expression, "Kissed by a muse"?

932
01:06:19,829 --> 01:06:22,498
That's what I am.
I'm a muse

933
01:06:22,623 --> 01:06:24,083
I'm glad somebody's
havin' a good time

934
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:25,543
Please don't make a joke

935
01:06:25,668 --> 01:06:27,712
I'm serious

936
01:06:27,837 --> 01:06:30,089
I come from Mount Helicon

937
01:06:30,214 --> 01:06:32,445
I'm the daughter of Zeus

938
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:34,677
I have eight sisters.
My real name is T...

939
01:06:37,764 --> 01:06:40,099
Are you telling me
that's not real?

940
01:06:40,224 --> 01:06:44,270
I'm trying to tell you the truth.
Why don't you believe me?

941
01:06:44,354 --> 01:06:47,023
Look up the word "muse"
in the dictionary. Go on

942
01:06:47,148 --> 01:06:50,276
- Page 728. Read it
- Okay

943
01:06:50,401 --> 01:06:52,528
All right, I'll read it

944
01:06:54,113 --> 01:06:58,618
- "'Muse' Any of the nine sister"
- Like the album cover?

945
01:06:58,743 --> 01:07:01,204
Hmm?

946
01:07:01,329 --> 01:07:04,624
<i>"Any of the nine sister
goddesses in Greek Mythology</i>

947
01:07:04,749 --> 01:07:08,086
<i>presiding over song and poetry
and the arts and sciences</i>

948
01:07:08,211 --> 01:07:10,463
<i>And do you believe me
now, Sonny?"</i>

949
01:07:11,964 --> 01:07:14,926
How'd you do that?
What's goin' on?

950
01:07:15,051 --> 01:07:17,470
The television

951
01:07:20,848 --> 01:07:23,935
<i>Well, well, look who's here</i>

952
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:26,979
<i>Who's chasing you this
time, Vargas? The cops?</i>

953
01:07:27,105 --> 01:07:30,483
<i>- Or the mob?
- Don't get smart with me, Nick</i>

954
01:07:30,608 --> 01:07:33,277
<i>I told you to stay away
from Brenda Trent</i>

955
01:07:33,403 --> 01:07:38,157
<i>Ah, yes, you did tell me.
What should I do, Sonny?</i>

956
01:07:38,282 --> 01:07:41,035
<i>Dive at him
or, uh, make a martini?</i>

957
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,341
What?

958
01:07:42,342 --> 01:07:44,122
<i>Who you talking to?</i>

959
01:07:44,247 --> 01:07:47,208
<i>Sonny Malone. He doesn't
believe Kira's a muse</i>

960
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:49,669
How can you be talking
to me? You're a movie

961
01:07:49,752 --> 01:07:53,089
<i>I ain't got time for this, Malone</i>

962
01:07:53,214 --> 01:07:56,467
<i>Brenda's the only one
that saw me at the racetrack</i>

963
01:07:56,551 --> 01:08:00,430
<i>Now if the lady says
she's a muse she's a muse</i>

964
01:08:00,555 --> 01:08:03,641
<i>Who's that? Brenda!</i>

965
01:08:03,766 --> 01:08:05,559
Kira

966
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,353
<i>Sonny</i>

967
01:08:08,813 --> 01:08:11,941
<i>I think he needs a drink</i>

968
01:08:12,066 --> 01:08:15,028
It's okay I'll take care
of it. Thanks

969
01:08:15,111 --> 01:08:19,490
<i>Good luck on the
opening of your joint, kid</i>

970
01:08:19,615 --> 01:08:22,160
<i>Wish I could be there</i>

971
01:08:26,956 --> 01:08:29,959
Oh, wow!

972
01:08:30,084 --> 01:08:32,211
Oh, Sonny

973
01:08:32,337 --> 01:08:35,089
We've been painted by Michelangelo

974
01:08:35,214 --> 01:08:38,051
Shakespeare's written
sonnets about us

975
01:08:38,176 --> 01:08:41,054
Beethoven's played music for us

976
01:08:41,179 --> 01:08:45,224
We're not supposed to feel
emotion or show any feelings

977
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:48,770
Muses are just
supposed to inspire

978
01:08:51,314 --> 01:08:53,441
I fell in love

979
01:08:53,566 --> 01:08:55,610
You did?

980
01:08:55,735 --> 01:08:58,655
Well, what do you think
happened to me?

981
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:01,407
It was a mistake.
I broke the rules

982
01:09:01,532 --> 01:09:03,910
Well, now what
the hell do we do, huh?

983
01:09:04,035 --> 01:09:06,120
- Answer that, muse!
- I don't know

984
01:09:06,245 --> 01:09:10,124
I'm sorry. It just never
should have happened

985
01:09:10,249 --> 01:09:14,420
- Well, it did
- I love you, Sonny

986
01:09:18,299 --> 01:09:20,510
Kira

987
01:09:20,593 --> 01:09:22,887
I'll love you forever

988
01:09:23,012 --> 01:09:25,348
I will

989
01:09:25,431 --> 01:09:28,893
I'll love you forever

990
01:09:30,186 --> 01:09:32,438
Kira! Wait!

991
01:09:33,523 --> 01:09:35,775
<i>I'll love you forever</i>

992
01:09:42,865 --> 01:09:46,744
Hey, painter! I've been
lookin' for you. Where you been?

993
01:09:46,869 --> 01:09:49,831
- Here
- Well, how do I look?

994
01:09:49,914 --> 01:09:52,917
Aren't you gonna say
anything about my new threads?

995
01:09:54,043 --> 01:09:55,920
Hubba, hubba

996
01:09:57,547 --> 01:10:01,092
Well, uh we're gonna
miss you tonight

997
01:10:01,217 --> 01:10:04,137
- It won't be any fun without you
- I told you

998
01:10:04,262 --> 01:10:06,264
I can't go

999
01:10:06,389 --> 01:10:08,307
Xanadu doesn't matter any more

1000
01:10:08,391 --> 01:10:12,270
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
How can it not matter?

1001
01:10:12,395 --> 01:10:16,357
This was our dream.
Well, well, wasn't it?

1002
01:10:17,734 --> 01:10:21,946
There's no Xanadu
'cause there's no Kira

1003
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:25,700
- She made it real
- So find her!

1004
01:10:25,825 --> 01:10:27,910
Bring her back!

1005
01:10:27,994 --> 01:10:30,830
- Dreams die
- No

1006
01:10:30,913 --> 01:10:34,792
No, no, no. Not by
themselves. We. We kill them

1007
01:10:34,917 --> 01:10:37,754
Now, if you give up,
you'll be sitting on that rock

1008
01:10:37,879 --> 01:10:40,256
30 years from now
just like I was

1009
01:10:40,381 --> 01:10:44,677
I know how you feel, kid.
I felt the same way once I did

1010
01:10:44,802 --> 01:10:47,513
I didn't know
how important love is

1011
01:10:47,638 --> 01:10:50,683
But let me
tell you something

1012
01:10:50,808 --> 01:10:54,812
Somehow, somewhere,
there's a way to get her!

1013
01:10:54,937 --> 01:10:57,648
If she got here, there's
a way to get there

1014
01:10:57,774 --> 01:11:01,235
Believe me, kid,
it's up to you

1015
01:11:02,779 --> 01:11:05,657
It's-It's up to you

1016
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:30,515
<i>I see the early glow</i>

1017
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,518
<i>I hear you say hello</i>

1018
01:11:34,995 --> 01:11:38,940
<i>I watch the shadows fall</i>

1019
01:11:39,065 --> 01:11:41,192
<i>I don't see you at all</i>

1020
01:11:41,317 --> 01:11:45,488
<i>- It's a lie
- Don't believe it's so</i>

1021
01:11:45,613 --> 01:11:48,366
<i>It's a lie</i>

1022
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:53,454
<i>I see the autumn rain</i>

1023
01:11:53,579 --> 01:11:57,583
<i>Falling on my window pane</i>

1024
01:11:57,709 --> 01:12:00,378
<i>I hear you say goodbye</i>

1025
01:12:01,838 --> 01:12:04,007
<i>I see a tear in your eye</i>

1026
01:12:04,132 --> 01:12:08,094
<i>- It's a lie
- Don't believe it's so</i>

1027
01:12:08,219 --> 01:12:11,848
<i>It's a lie</i>

1028
01:12:13,057 --> 01:12:16,310
<i>Our love couldn't go wrong</i>

1029
01:12:16,436 --> 01:12:18,730
<i>How could I know</i>

1030
01:12:18,855 --> 01:12:21,107
<i>I was only dreaming</i>

1031
01:12:21,190 --> 01:12:24,719
<i>And now... Now that you're gone</i>

1032
01:12:24,945 --> 01:12:29,365
<i>I will go on really believing</i>

1033
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:33,161
<i>I'll take the fall</i>

1034
01:12:47,592 --> 01:12:50,428
<i>I'll take the fall</i>

1035
01:12:51,804 --> 01:12:55,641
<i>I see you in a dream</i>

1036
01:12:55,767 --> 01:12:58,895
<i>You turn and start to go</i>

1037
01:13:00,021 --> 01:13:03,399
<i>I call to you once more</i>

1038
01:13:04,567 --> 01:13:06,819
<i>Guess that I'm takin' the fall</i>

1039
01:13:06,944 --> 01:13:10,823
<i>- It's a lie
- Don't believe it's so</i>

1040
01:13:10,948 --> 01:13:14,077
<i>It's a lie</i>

1041
01:13:15,203 --> 01:13:18,539
<i>Our love couldn't go wrong</i>

1042
01:13:18,665 --> 01:13:22,877
<i>How could I know
I was only dreaming</i>

1043
01:13:23,002 --> 01:13:27,215
<i>And now now that you're gone</i>

1044
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:31,636
<i>I will go on really believing</i>

1045
01:13:34,931 --> 01:13:39,060
<i>I'll take the fall</i>

1046
01:14:25,898 --> 01:14:28,359
Kira

1047
01:14:28,484 --> 01:14:31,446
Sonny. How d id you get here?

1048
01:14:31,571 --> 01:14:34,407
You didn't think I'd let you
get away from me, did you?

1049
01:14:34,532 --> 01:14:39,078
- You'll have to go back
- Okay, I'm ready. Let's go

1050
01:14:39,203 --> 01:14:41,080
I can't go with you

1051
01:14:41,205 --> 01:14:45,043
But you have to get
out before it's too late

1052
01:14:45,168 --> 01:14:47,045
Too late for what?

1053
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:49,630
Oh, please, you took
a big chance coming here

1054
01:14:49,756 --> 01:14:53,885
What's going on here?
I'm taking you back with me, Kira

1055
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:57,638
It can't be done. Nobody's
ever taken anyone out of here

1056
01:14:57,764 --> 01:15:00,725
Not in the whole history
of the whole history

1057
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:04,270
I'll make 'em let you go.
Hey, Zeus!

1058
01:15:04,395 --> 01:15:07,690
- Zeus, you hear me?
- Oh, God

1059
01:15:07,815 --> 01:15:10,109
I wanna talk to you

1060
01:15:10,234 --> 01:15:14,238
We don't use those
old-fashioned names any more

1061
01:15:14,364 --> 01:15:17,450
In any case, it's me
you want to speak to

1062
01:15:17,575 --> 01:15:19,619
I've come to get Kira

1063
01:15:19,744 --> 01:15:23,331
She's not leaving!
It's impossible!

1064
01:15:23,456 --> 01:15:27,126
- That's what you think
- That's what you think

1065
01:15:27,251 --> 01:15:29,065
How'd you know
I was gonna say that?

1066
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:30,880
I'm a good guesser

1067
01:15:31,005 --> 01:15:33,466
What else do you know?

1068
01:15:33,549 --> 01:15:36,427
- Everything
- All right, then. You know this

1069
01:15:36,511 --> 01:15:39,597
I'm sticking to this place
till hell freezes over

1070
01:15:39,722 --> 01:15:41,557
Sonny!

1071
01:15:41,683 --> 01:15:44,977
You'll leave now and
you'll leave without Kira!

1072
01:15:45,103 --> 01:15:48,481
- Why?
- Because other people have dreams

1073
01:15:48,606 --> 01:15:52,735
So send another muse You got muses
running around all over the place

1074
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:55,989
One dream, one muse

1075
01:15:56,072 --> 01:15:58,741
Wait. Wait a minute.
Just listen to me, okay?

1076
01:16:01,619 --> 01:16:03,496
Kira and I love each other

1077
01:16:03,621 --> 01:16:06,749
Now I don't know how often
that happens in this kind of place

1078
01:16:06,833 --> 01:16:10,253
but back on earth,
it's pretty rare

1079
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:15,341
- We need to be together
- All right, that's enough

1080
01:16:15,466 --> 01:16:18,636
You're leaving Kira's staying.
No more discussions

1081
01:16:18,761 --> 01:16:21,931
Those are the rules and
that's all there is to it

1082
01:16:22,056 --> 01:16:25,601
On the other hand, dear,
rules were made to be broken

1083
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:27,603
We'll talk about that later

1084
01:16:27,729 --> 01:16:29,731
Which is later and earlier?

1085
01:16:29,856 --> 01:16:31,983
- I keep forgetting
- Just a minute!

1086
01:16:32,108 --> 01:16:35,194
Isn't anyone interested
in my feelings?

1087
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,613
What do you mean, "feelings"?

1088
01:16:37,739 --> 01:16:40,867
Oh, you remember, pet.
We learned about feelings

1089
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:45,288
- in our mortal history class
- Yes, feelings

1090
01:16:45,413 --> 01:16:50,376
I guess that's what you call 'em.
I've never really had them before

1091
01:16:50,501 --> 01:16:54,130
I've never felt this way
about anyone before

1092
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:59,093
And I've never asked
to leave here. Not ever

1093
01:16:59,218 --> 01:17:01,179
Not once in the whole
time. I've been here

1094
01:17:01,304 --> 01:17:05,224
It's true, dear, she hasn't.
Not in all these centuries

1095
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:08,770
Or is it minutes?
I do keep mixing them up

1096
01:17:08,895 --> 01:17:13,733
Please, can't we just have
this one night? Just one night?

1097
01:17:13,858 --> 01:17:17,820
No, no, it's just not possible.
Goodbye, Sonny Malone

1098
01:17:17,945 --> 01:17:22,200
- Hey, Kira?
- Just one moment

1099
01:17:22,617 --> 01:17:24,494
Goodbye, Sonny

1100
01:17:24,619 --> 01:17:27,914
Kira!

1101
01:17:36,589 --> 01:17:41,386
<i>A child and a fool in one</i>

1102
01:17:41,511 --> 01:17:46,391
<i>So sure I could need no one</i>

1103
01:17:46,516 --> 01:17:52,689
<i>My heart always on
the run to nowhere</i>

1104
01:17:56,401 --> 01:18:01,072
<i>Now as you're holding me</i>

1105
01:18:01,197 --> 01:18:06,452
<i>My heart is reminding me</i>

1106
01:18:06,577 --> 01:18:10,748
<i>That now I could never be</i>

1107
01:18:10,832 --> 01:18:13,876
<i>Without you</i>

1108
01:18:15,753 --> 01:18:20,550
<i>But how can our love succeed</i>

1109
01:18:20,633 --> 01:18:25,430
<i>A miracle is what we need</i>

1110
01:18:25,513 --> 01:18:30,351
<i>And so I appeal to you</i>

1111
01:18:33,062 --> 01:18:37,942
<i>To keep me suspended
in time with you</i>

1112
01:18:38,067 --> 01:18:41,696
<i>Don't let this moment die</i>

1113
01:18:42,947 --> 01:18:47,702
<i>I get a feeling when
I'm with you</i>

1114
01:18:47,827 --> 01:18:52,457
<i>None of the rules apply</i>

1115
01:18:52,582 --> 01:18:57,337
<i>But I know for certain
goodbye is a crime</i>

1116
01:18:57,462 --> 01:19:05,136
<i>So, love, if you need me
suspend me in time</i>

1117
01:19:10,099 --> 01:19:14,145
<i>Ahhh</i>

1118
01:19:19,942 --> 01:19:25,239
<i>Wasted the time away</i>

1119
01:19:25,365 --> 01:19:30,036
<i>Holding our love at bay</i>

1120
01:19:30,161 --> 01:19:34,207
<i>Now I can't last a day</i>

1121
01:19:34,332 --> 01:19:36,709
<i>Without you</i>

1122
01:19:39,337 --> 01:19:44,717
<i>Your smile is a thrill to see</i>

1123
01:19:44,842 --> 01:19:49,555
<i>Your eyes hold me tenderly</i>

1124
01:19:49,681 --> 01:19:55,770
<i>They'll shine in
my memory forever</i>

1125
01:19:58,981 --> 01:20:03,736
<i>But how can our love succeed</i>

1126
01:20:03,861 --> 01:20:08,616
<i>A miracle is what we need</i>

1127
01:20:08,741 --> 01:20:13,162
<i>And so I appeal to you</i>

1128
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:21,045
<i>To keep me suspended
in time with you</i>

1129
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:24,841
<i>Don't let this moment die</i>

1130
01:20:26,092 --> 01:20:30,930
<i>I get a feeling when
I'm with you</i>

1131
01:20:31,055 --> 01:20:35,685
<i>None of the rules apply</i>

1132
01:20:35,810 --> 01:20:40,523
<i>But I know for certain
goodbye is a crime</i>

1133
01:20:40,648 --> 01:20:48,448
<i>So, love, if you need me
suspend me in time</i>

1134
01:20:53,286 --> 01:21:01,044
<i>In time</i>

1135
01:21:10,845 --> 01:21:14,432
Maybe just one moment, darling

1136
01:21:14,557 --> 01:21:18,186
Well, maybe just one moment

1137
01:21:18,311 --> 01:21:20,229
or forever

1138
01:21:20,355 --> 01:21:23,274
I keep getting them mixed up too

1139
01:21:37,747 --> 01:21:40,416
<i>All right, everybody, let's skate!</i>

1140
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:42,960
<i>Let's skate!</i>

1141
01:21:43,086 --> 01:21:47,256
<i>Everybody! Come on!</i>

1142
01:21:47,382 --> 01:21:50,176
<i>Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!</i>

1143
01:22:02,021 --> 01:22:04,399
I don't even know yet

1144
01:22:19,372 --> 01:22:21,916
<i>U- U-Up!</i>

1145
01:22:23,668 --> 01:22:25,628
<i>Hey!</i>

1146
01:22:53,698 --> 01:22:55,700
<i>Xanadu!</i>

1147
01:22:58,661 --> 01:23:00,538
<i>Xanadu!</i>

1148
01:23:01,664 --> 01:23:03,333
<i>Xanadu!</i>

1149
01:23:06,169 --> 01:23:08,046
<i>Xanadu!</i>

1150
01:23:09,213 --> 01:23:11,632
<i>Xanadu!</i>

1151
01:23:14,093 --> 01:23:17,013
<i>Xanadu!</i>

1152
01:23:44,499 --> 01:23:46,459
<i>Ho!</i>

1153
01:23:48,086 --> 01:23:50,338
<i>Ho!</i>

1154
01:23:51,881 --> 01:23:53,925
<i>Ho!</i>

1155
01:23:54,884 --> 01:23:57,011
<i>Ho!</i>

1156
01:23:59,347 --> 01:24:01,224
<i>Ho!</i>

1157
01:24:03,267 --> 01:24:05,395
<i>Ho!</i>

1158
01:24:06,354 --> 01:24:08,398
<i>Ho!</i>

1159
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:13,111
<i>Ho!</i>

1160
01:24:15,905 --> 01:24:17,991
<i>Xanadu!</i>

1161
01:24:19,784 --> 01:24:21,786
<i>Xanadu!</i>

1162
01:24:23,371 --> 01:24:25,581
<i>Xanadu!</i>

1163
01:24:27,333 --> 01:24:29,711
<i>Xanadu!</i>

1164
01:24:30,795 --> 01:24:32,714
<i>Xanadu!</i>

1165
01:24:34,966 --> 01:24:37,427
<i>Xanadu!</i>

1166
01:24:43,474 --> 01:24:45,393
<i>Ho!</i>

1167
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:49,230
<i>Ho!</i>

1168
01:24:50,398 --> 01:24:52,275
<i>Ho!</i>

1169
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,360
<i>A place</i>

1170
01:24:54,485 --> 01:24:58,114
<i>Where nobody dared to go</i>

1171
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:00,992
<i>The love that we came to know</i>

1172
01:25:01,117 --> 01:25:04,245
<i>They call it Xanadu</i>

1173
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:07,415
<i>It takes your breath
and it'll leave you blind</i>

1174
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:09,876
<i>And now</i>

1175
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:13,504
<i>Open your eyes and see</i>

1176
01:25:13,629 --> 01:25:16,299
<i>What we have made is real</i>

1177
01:25:16,424 --> 01:25:19,260
<i>We are in Xanadu</i>

1178
01:25:19,385 --> 01:25:22,055
<i>A dream of it we offer you</i>

1179
01:25:23,723 --> 01:25:26,059
<i>A million lights are dancing</i>

1180
01:25:26,184 --> 01:25:30,855
<i>And there you are
a shooting star</i>

1181
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:33,650
<i>An everlasting love</i>

1182
01:25:33,775 --> 01:25:38,071
<i>And you're here
with me eternally</i>

1183
01:25:39,989 --> 01:25:42,283
<i>Xanadu</i>

1184
01:25:43,785 --> 01:25:46,829
<i>Xanadu</i>

1185
01:25:46,913 --> 01:25:50,458
<i>- Now we are here
- In Xanadu</i>

1186
01:25:55,171 --> 01:25:57,131
<i>Xanadu</i>

1187
01:25:59,467 --> 01:26:01,636
<i>Xanadu</i>

1188
01:26:01,761 --> 01:26:06,349
<i>- Now we are here
- In Xanadu</i>

1189
01:26:06,432 --> 01:26:11,479
<i>Xanadu
Your neon lights will shine</i>

1190
01:26:11,604 --> 01:26:15,692
<i>For you in Xanadu</i>

1191
01:26:17,443 --> 01:26:19,404
<i>The love</i>

1192
01:26:19,529 --> 01:26:23,241
<i>The echoes of long ago</i>

1193
01:26:23,366 --> 01:26:26,160
<i>You needed the world to know</i>

1194
01:26:26,285 --> 01:26:29,205
<i>They are in Xanadu</i>

1195
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:31,541
<i>With every breath you drift away</i>

1196
01:26:32,666 --> 01:26:34,252
<i>The dream</i>

1197
01:26:34,377 --> 01:26:37,964
<i>That came through
a million years</i>

1198
01:26:38,089 --> 01:26:41,092
<i>That lived on
through all the tears</i>

1199
01:26:41,217 --> 01:26:43,970
<i>It came to Xanadu</i>

1200
01:26:44,095 --> 01:26:48,433
<i>The dream you dream
Well, it will happen for you</i>

1201
01:26:48,558 --> 01:26:51,269
<i>A million lights are dancing</i>

1202
01:26:51,352 --> 01:26:56,149
<i>And there you are
a shooting star</i>

1203
01:26:56,232 --> 01:26:58,276
<i>An everlasting love</i>

1204
01:26:58,401 --> 01:27:02,947
<i>And you're here
with me eternally</i>

1205
01:27:05,074 --> 01:27:07,035
<i>Xanadu</i>

1206
01:27:08,828 --> 01:27:11,664
<i>Xanadu</i>

1207
01:27:11,789 --> 01:27:16,419
<i>- Now we are here... Xanadu
- In Xanadu</i>

1208
01:27:20,131 --> 01:27:22,091
<i>Xanadu</i>

1209
01:27:23,843 --> 01:27:26,262
<i>Xanadu</i>

1210
01:27:26,387 --> 01:27:30,077
<i>Now we are here
In Xanadu</i>

1211
01:27:30,112 --> 01:27:31,768
<i>Xanadu, Xanadu</i>

1212
01:27:31,893 --> 01:27:36,689
<i>Now that I'm here
Now that you're near</i>

1213
01:27:36,814 --> 01:27:39,442
<i>In Xanadu</i>

1214
01:27:39,567 --> 01:27:44,030
<i>Now that I'm here
Now that you're near</i>

1215
01:27:44,155 --> 01:27:50,995
<i>In Xanadu</i>

1216
01:28:54,267 --> 01:28:56,310
<i>Way to go!</i>

1217
01:28:59,564 --> 01:29:01,441
<i>Fool</i>

1218
01:29:01,566 --> 01:29:04,485
<i>Whatever you do
you're reminded</i>

1219
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:07,405
<i>Fool</i>

1220
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:11,451
<i>Wherever you go
you won't find it</i>

1221
01:29:11,576 --> 01:29:14,871
<i>I'm really down on love
so save all your smiles</i>

1222
01:29:14,996 --> 01:29:17,665
<i>Ooo, I won't be needin'
any love for a while</i>

1223
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:20,793
<i>I'm really down on love
so save all your smiles</i>

1224
01:29:20,918 --> 01:29:24,172
<i>Ooo, I won't be needin'
any love for a while. Ooo-ooo</i>

1225
01:29:24,297 --> 01:29:27,508
<i>- Ooo Ooo
- Ooo-ooo</i>

1226
01:29:27,592 --> 01:29:29,719
<i>Ooo
Uh-uh</i>

1227
01:29:29,844 --> 01:29:34,223
<i>O- o-oh wherever you go
you're a loser</i>

1228
01:29:35,308 --> 01:29:37,185
<i>Such a fool</i>

1229
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:41,230
<i>I want you to know
you're a loser</i>

1230
01:29:41,314 --> 01:29:44,609
<i>I'm really down on love

1234
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:56,496
<i>Fool
Fool</i>

1235
