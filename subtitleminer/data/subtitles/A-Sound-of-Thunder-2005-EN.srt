1
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,316
I haven't seen any wildlife yet.

2
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:20,279
We could be in downtown Pittsburgh,
for all I know.

3
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:22,531
Dad, how are you holding up?

4
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:24,283
I'm fine, I'm fine,

5
00:01:24,658 --> 00:01:27,327
except for you asking me every
two minutes how I'm holding up.

6
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:29,371
Sorry, honey.

7
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,039
I'm hot.

8
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,209
How much further do we...

9
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,587
Jesus, take that thing
out of my face!

10
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,091
Sorry, Dad doesn't like cameras unless
he's got his trench coat over his face.

11
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:43,552
How's the old man doing?

12
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,680
Heart rate slightly elevated,
blood pressure normal.

13
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:50,517
I got $100 says Travis
taps his daughter tonight.

14
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:51,768
Sucker bet.

15
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:54,771
You might want to record
over the last bit.

16
00:01:56,982 --> 00:01:58,775
When are we gonna see something?

17
00:02:00,477 --> 00:02:01,461
What?

18
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,739
If you don't talk,
you might hear something.

19
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:05,199
Hear what?

20
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:10,037
All right, everyone, get ready!

21
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:13,123
Remember, your weapons
won't fire until mine does,

22
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:14,791
so be patient!

23
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:23,216
What the...?

24
00:02:24,134 --> 00:02:25,677
Wait for my command!

25
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:31,350
Dad, how are you...

26
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:34,102
Sorry!

27
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:41,860
Whatever happens,
do not step off of the path.

28
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:43,403
Thank you for sharing.

29
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:49,576
Oh, my God!

30
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:53,288
Cute, isn't he?

31
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:02,089
You don't see that in downtown
Pittsburgh, do you Mr. Wallenbeck?

32
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:10,013
Shoot, for Christ's sake!

33
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,266
Heart rate elevated.

34
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,895
- Shoot it!
- Wait.

35
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:24,528
Hold it.

36
00:03:28,115 --> 00:03:29,992
- Not yet!
- Are you crazy?

37
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:31,535
Shoot it!

38
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:35,706
Now!

39
00:04:17,206 --> 00:04:19,208
Anything to say, Mr. Wallenbeck?

40
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:34,473
Gentlemen and lady.

41
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:38,352
Today you stood shoulder-to-shoulder
with Columbus discovering America,

42
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,939
Armstrong stepping on the moon,
Brubaker landing on Mars.

43
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:42,940
You are true pioneers

44
00:04:43,148 --> 00:04:46,193
on the very last frontier:
Time.

45
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:49,238
On behalf of us all at Time Safari,
Incorporated,

46
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:53,033
I congratulate you
on a truly thrilling hunt.

47
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:54,993
I'm proud to know you.

48
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,912
I have to say,

49
00:04:57,996 --> 00:05:00,040
of all the jumps I've seen,

50
00:05:00,374 --> 00:05:03,919
your group's was by far
the most courageous and skillful.

51
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:07,172
I was scared out of my mind.
My heart's still pounding.

52
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:10,509
That's a nominal physiological
reaction to the jump.

53
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:13,679
Your heart rate will slow
as we gain distance from the event

54
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:16,014
and adrenaline flow
is reduced.

55
00:05:16,223 --> 00:05:17,224
What?

56
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:18,684
It is.

57
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:26,358
Can I ask you something, Mr. Hatton?

58
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:28,861
Of course.
Anything at all.

59
00:05:29,778 --> 00:05:31,572
Where's Travis Ryer?

60
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:54,636
- You look like you could use a drink.
- Nope.

61
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:56,430
You're a government inspector.

62
00:05:56,638 --> 00:05:58,974
- You're supposed to drink on the job.
- I don't drink.

63
00:05:59,183 --> 00:06:01,560
Then this is the best
you'll feel all day.

64
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:04,813
- I hate these jumps, is all.
- Picked the right line of work.

65
00:06:05,022 --> 00:06:07,399
Biding my time.
Couple more years, I'll be out.

66
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:10,360
Civil Service pays you guys
enough to retire early?

67
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:13,655
Have a good night.

68
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,826
This is the clearest reading of
molecular blood structure

69
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:20,162
<i>- we've ever had.
- You are correct, Dr. Ryer.</i>

70
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,663
I'm getting closer and you know it.

71
00:06:21,872 --> 00:06:24,208
<i>- Yes, Dr. Ryer.
- Contain your enthusiasm.</i>

72
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,044
<i>My function is to facilitate
the operation of Time Safari,</i>

73
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:29,296
<i>not your private research.
On that subject,</i>

74
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:32,674
<i>will you be filing your report
on today's jump tonight</i>

75
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:34,801
<i>or at the last possible moment
tomorrow, as usual?</i>

76
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,595
<i>- Nobody likes a nag.
- Reminding is not nagging.</i>

77
00:06:36,803 --> 00:06:38,514
You've got an answer for everything.

78
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:40,849
<i>I have to.
I was extremely expensive.</i>

79
00:06:41,058 --> 00:06:42,476
It's not always a good quality.

80
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:44,144
<i>I understand, Dr. Ryer.</i>

81
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:45,979
So don't have the last word.

82
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:47,981
<i>- I won't, Dr. Ryer.
- You did it.</i>

83
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,942
<i>- I'm sorry, Dr. Ryer.
- You did it again.</i>

84
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,569
Anything going on between you two
that I should know about?

85
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:55,239
<i>- Good evening, Mr. Hatton.
- Hello, TAMI.</i>

86
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:57,282
The guests are asking for you.

87
00:06:57,866 --> 00:06:59,493
I'll be finished in a few minutes.

88
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:02,955
When I say guests,
it's a euphemism. I mean clients,

89
00:07:03,163 --> 00:07:04,957
as in "people who pay. "

90
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:07,334
If I remember correctly,
clients keep us waiting,

91
00:07:07,543 --> 00:07:09,503
not the other way around.

92
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:10,754
I'm almost done.

93
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,259
I don't think
you're catching my drift.

94
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:19,805
You work here so you can study

95
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:22,015
your silly animals
who don't exist anymore.

96
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:24,560
I work here so I can grow
rich and fat

97
00:07:24,768 --> 00:07:27,437
and own everything
that does happen to exist.

98
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:31,024
I hired you because
you're this big deal scientist

99
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:33,986
and clients pay more for a big deal
anything, it makes them feel important.

100
00:07:34,194 --> 00:07:36,905
Rotten, I know.
But progress is a rotten business,

101
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:39,491
which is why you have to go
out there and mingle with them.

102
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,995
They pay, you study, I get rich.
Is this a great country, or what?

103
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:47,416
Did I mention you signed
a contract and you have to do this?

104
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:49,251
I don't remember if I did.

105
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:55,090
Oh, my speech was that good?

106
00:07:55,632 --> 00:07:57,092
Or were you done anyway?

107
00:08:02,556 --> 00:08:04,558
A safari suit, boots, helmet

108
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:06,727
and a holo-disc to relive the jump.

109
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,022
Take an especially close look
at this disc,

110
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,440
- Mr. Wallenbeck.
- Why's that?

111
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:12,608
Well...

112
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:16,653
I can't be certain
until I review it myself,

113
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:19,781
but I'm pretty sure
your shot brought him down.

114
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:24,536
Well, yeah.

115
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:39,760
Security!

116
00:08:41,178 --> 00:08:43,639
A toast to all of you big,
brave hunters!

117
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:45,140
Congratulations!

118
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:49,645
What's the matter?

119
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:52,397
You want to shoot dinosaurs,
you're afraid of a little blood?

120
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:55,484
You don't understand
the danger of what you're doing!

121
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:58,487
You keep messing with the past,
one day you'll ruin the future!

122
00:08:58,862 --> 00:09:01,031
You should know better!

123
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,867
Are you so stupid
you can't see you're being used?

124
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:10,040
Well, that was fun.

125
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,335
Harder and harder to get good waiters.

126
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:31,520
- What was she yelling about?
- The usual:

127
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,106
Time jumps
will destroy the world. Crackpot.

128
00:09:34,314 --> 00:09:38,235
A century ago she would have been
screaming about the Internet or biotech.

129
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:41,655
Some people are afraid of progress.
She's a dinosaur herself.

130
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:44,158
Let her yell all she wants.

131
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,535
Don't let her spoil the party.

132
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:52,708
I'm fine!

133
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,836
- I prefer walking on my own, thanks.
- Guys, whoa! Hold on.

134
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:58,338
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

135
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,800
Tell me what that was all about.

136
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:05,220
You don't have a clue what you're doing.
You'll destroy everything!

137
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:08,640
Lady, no offense, but I think
I'm qualified to offer an opinion.

138
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:10,642
I work with TAMI. I lead the jumps.

139
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:12,603
You're the one who's clueless.

140
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:14,730
- You're Travis Ryer?
- That's right.

141
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:16,899
Mr. Ryer, there's a lot
about TAMI you don't know.

142
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:19,401
- It's Dr. Ryer.
- Dr. Ryer.

143
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,112
One of the many things
you don't know is that I'm Sonia Rand.

144
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,448
I invented TAMI, you asshole.

145
00:10:26,617 --> 00:10:27,951
Excuse me!

146
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,703
Miss, wait up a second.

147
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:33,248
There are seven credited names
on TAMI's patent.

148
00:10:33,457 --> 00:10:35,250
I don't recall
a Dr. Rand being one of them.

149
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,253
- I don't have time for stupid people.
- Make some time.

150
00:10:38,462 --> 00:10:40,797
And stop with the insults.
It gets on my nerves.

151
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:43,675
Do you think I'd devote
my career to designing

152
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:46,053
an amusement park ride
for rich men with little willies

153
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:47,846
to shoot prehistoric animals?

154
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:49,806
I think if you were a guy

155
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:52,309
someone would have knocked you
on your ass a long time ago.

156
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,478
So shoot me.

157
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:57,231
If you oppose TAMI's use,
why build her

158
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,983
- in the first place?
- I built her because I'm a scientist.

159
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,821
Possibilities drive us. What they said
was impossible, I knew could be done.

160
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:06,323
I applied for a research grant
with a company called CJN Co.

161
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,451
They handed out money
and left me alone.

162
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,870
Your actual dream come true,
until I finished developing TAMI.

163
00:11:12,246 --> 00:11:13,539
Then why haven't I heard of you?

164
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:17,125
I'm a nerd, not a lawyer. Turns out
there was a clause in my contract.

165
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:20,045
CJN Co. Owned the patent on whatever
I developed with their money.

166
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,547
Guess who controls the company?

167
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,715
- Charles Hatton.
- Very good.

168
00:11:23,924 --> 00:11:25,884
It seems I signed
a non-disclosure agreement,

169
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:28,595
so Hatton removed my name and,

170
00:11:28,804 --> 00:11:30,389
except for tonight, shut me up.

171
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:33,392
I get upset watching you people
destroy the world with my dream.

172
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,103
That can piss someone off.
What's your excuse?

173
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:37,396
You really want to know?

174
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:51,368
I'm getting close,

175
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:54,913
- really close.
- Close to what?

176
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:58,876
Look carefully.
Tell me what you think it is.

177
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:00,294
A DNA strand of some kind.

178
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:03,589
- Can you tell what kind?
- No, I got a D in Biology.

179
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:10,429
His ancestor.

180
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:14,683
When I was a little boy,
my grandfather used to tell me stories

181
00:12:14,892 --> 00:12:17,853
about actually seeing
real animals in the wild.

182
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:20,814
Imagine seeing him run free.

183
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:24,276
The last wild animal born
out of captivity was a crocodile.

184
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:26,195
She died 38 years ago.

185
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,280
Then the poachers started
hitting the zoos and the virus

186
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:30,824
took care of the rest.
Millions of years of evolution,

187
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:32,868
and we kill them off
in a few thousand...

188
00:12:33,076 --> 00:12:35,913
and screw up their DNA.
We can't even clone them.

189
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:37,748
- He was beautiful.
- That's why I do this job.

190
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,418
When we go on a hunt we obviously
can't take physical samples,

191
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,421
but I've created a way
to take remote DNA readings.

192
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,632
I can only do it in bits,
but the bits add up.

193
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,259
One day, I'll reconstruct
the DNA from animals

194
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,261
that lived long before the virus.

195
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:53,889
I can bring them back.

196
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:56,225
Saving animals by killing them,
that makes sense.

197
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:58,936
The animals we hunt have to be
in the last seconds of their life

198
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:00,854
so we don't upset
the course of history.

199
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:02,814
That allosaurus is shot cleanly,

200
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:04,942
seconds before
he gets bogged down in a swamp

201
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,653
5 minutes before
a volcano erupts and fries him

202
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:09,446
in hot lava.

203
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,533
I wish people would pay
for a photo safari

204
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:14,868
instead of a hunting safari.

205
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:16,787
But they don't.
There's no other way.

206
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:20,457
So you bring rich tourists back
to the past o jeopardize the future.

207
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,252
I appreciate
what you're trying to accomplish.

208
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,295
But it's dangerous. This is bigger

209
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,589
than what you
or anyone else is working on.

210
00:13:27,798 --> 00:13:29,466
It's bulletproof.

211
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,385
A new government agency
is assigned to us.

212
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:34,054
They check our protocols up,
down, and sideways.

213
00:13:34,263 --> 00:13:35,681
That's how Hatton
got the green light.

214
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:38,267
You don't have a clue about
Charles Hatton! It's about money.

215
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:41,103
It's always the same
when there's so much of it involved.

216
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:42,771
But this is different.

217
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,524
You are messing
with the whole of evolution.

218
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:46,900
Nothing is bulletproof.

219
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,653
It must have been amazing.

220
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:52,698
God help us.

221
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:02,875
Hey, pal, you break it,
you bought it.

222
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:03,917
Sorry.

223
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:13,969
Whoa, what's that?

224
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:16,054
The molecular structure
of allosaurus blood.

225
00:14:16,263 --> 00:14:17,181
No way.

226
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,307
Cool.

227
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,463
The doorman let me in.

228
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:53,884
I told him I was
your cousin from St. Louis.

229
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:57,763
I always did like Aunt Martha.

230
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:12,694
I'm afraid I've killed it.
Or at least driven it to suicide.

231
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:14,238
Got a bit of a brown thumb.

232
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:19,618
- Maybe a little sunlight will help.
- You just moved in?

233
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:23,080
No, I've been here
for about two years.

234
00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:25,040
Okay.

235
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:36,552
Chloe thinks I'm going to a farm.

236
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,502
What's that about?

237
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:39,304
My wife told her I was
going to sow some wild oats.

238
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,182
Adorable. Little kids are adorable.

239
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,726
Could you say that
with less enthusiasm?

240
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:47,437
I'm not fond of adorable.
I rate it just below perky.

241
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,857
It's nice you have a family.

242
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:52,067
Without families,
what would we do with Christmas?

243
00:15:52,276 --> 00:15:54,403
Me? I run my company
and that's about it.

244
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:56,363
Your kids will grow up.

245
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,615
My company will be
acquired by somebody. So what?

246
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,826
We're sleepwalking through life.

247
00:16:01,034 --> 00:16:03,453
Admit it or not,
we're bored out of our minds.

248
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,080
I'm not bored out of my mind.

249
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:07,624
What's the last exciting thing you did?

250
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,585
- Play fetch with your dog?
- I don't know...

251
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:12,337
Come on! This'll arouse
the old, dormant male instinct.

252
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:14,840
- Make us feel alive.
- It's awfully expensive.

253
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,884
Why be rich if we don't buy things

254
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,552
other people can't afford?

255
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,146
George, how's life?

256
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:31,857
I can't complain.
If I did, who would listen?

257
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:34,109
Tell me about it. Oh, could you...

258
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:36,487
- I'll get a cab for your cousin.
- Thanks.

259
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,745
Standard liability release forms.

260
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:47,706
- That's a lot of forms.
- There's a lot of liability.

261
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:50,000
We take you back
65 million years to hunt

262
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,628
the greatest predator
the world has ever seen.

263
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:55,214
We are the first
and only people able to do this.

264
00:16:55,422 --> 00:16:59,176
We use technology that wasn't
even a dream a few years ago.

265
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:01,678
A new federal agency,
the Department of Temporal Regulation,

266
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,347
was created for us.

267
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,391
This is not a game.
There is no reset button.

268
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,976
Today, on this hunt...

269
00:17:08,185 --> 00:17:09,520
someone will die.

270
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,146
The prey... or the hunters.

271
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:15,192
There is no middle ground.
Imprint where indicated.

272
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:19,988
By the way,
deposits are non-refundable.

273
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:24,368
- Sure we should do this?
- There's a 6-year waiting list.

274
00:17:24,535 --> 00:17:26,912
We paid double to cut
to the head of the line

275
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,664
and you want to slink home?

276
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:31,625
You want to spend the rest of your life
with balls the size of BBs?

277
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,088
What the hell!

278
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:39,132
They're so big
I can hear 'em clanging.

279
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:46,598
How was the other night
with the lovely Ms. Wallenbeck?

280
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:49,852
- It's none of your business.
- He said defensively.

281
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:52,354
If you must know, I sent her home.

282
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:53,480
Before or after?

283
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:56,066
Sometimes you can be a real brat.

284
00:17:58,443 --> 00:18:01,780
Jen, I promised your father
that I would always look after you.

285
00:18:01,989 --> 00:18:03,532
- Are you going to lecture me?
- No, I just...

286
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,743
Good, because Jeffrey
and I only went out for...

287
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,162
Who is Jeffrey?

288
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,539
- You don't know?
- No. Who is he?

289
00:18:10,747 --> 00:18:13,125
I thought you were talking
about Jeffrey.

290
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,169
What exactly did you and Jeffrey do?

291
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:17,129
- Nothing.
- Tell me now.

292
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,755
Not going to happen.

293
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,344
What were you going to say just now?

294
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,347
I don't know.

295
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:30,392
I know we're sure
about what we're doing...

296
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:31,518
Yeah, and?

297
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:32,686
But maybe...

298
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:34,271
Maybe what?

299
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:37,232
I don't know. It's nothing.

300
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:52,372
Derris, what do you do
when you're not spying

301
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:55,959
for the government on us?
You got a family? Wife?

302
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:57,628
Significant other?

303
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:58,879
Goldfish?

304
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:01,548
No, you probably
go crazy at home, right?

305
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,719
Lampshade on your head,
chicken feet, whips.

306
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,221
I know it.

307
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:08,805
Everyone,

308
00:19:10,224 --> 00:19:12,726
this is Mr. Middleton

309
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:14,728
and Mr. Eckles.

310
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:17,564
Gentlemen, this is your jump team.

311
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:21,401
Jennifer Krase will record
the holo-disc of your hunt.

312
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,279
Marcus Payne is your jump technician.

313
00:19:24,738 --> 00:19:27,991
Dr. Lucas keeps
everyone ticking. And this...

314
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:31,203
is Dr. Travis Ryer.

315
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,663
You must be Mr. Eckles.

316
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,540
It's an honor to meet you, Dr. Ryer.

317
00:19:34,748 --> 00:19:36,708
You're half the reason
my wife let me do this.

318
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:39,336
- What's the other half?
- He has a huge insurance policy.

319
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:41,547
Mr. Middleton.

320
00:19:42,256 --> 00:19:45,676
It's nice to have clients who look
like they know what they're doing.

321
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,845
I have a good feeling about this jump.

322
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:50,264
You're in for the ride of your life.

323
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:52,307
We have developed technology

324
00:19:52,516 --> 00:19:54,518
that is absolute cutting edge.

325
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:58,272
Actually, it was developed for us
by a Dr. Sonia Rand.

326
00:19:58,689 --> 00:19:59,565
Isn't that correct?

327
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:07,406
Gentlemen, your weapons are
laser designated.

328
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:11,493
They're gauss rifles. They fire
frozen liquid nitrogen bullets

329
00:20:11,702 --> 00:20:14,288
- that completely dissolve in 2 minutes.
- Wait a minute.

330
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:16,248
We'll take down a dinosaur with ice?

331
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:28,051
Second rule of time jumping:
Don't leave anything behind.

332
00:20:37,227 --> 00:20:39,646
Not another.
I'm getting track marks.

333
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,858
The third rule of time jumping:
Don't bring anything back.

334
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:45,068
What's rule number one?

335
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:48,280
No matter how small, never change

336
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:50,657
anything in the past. Nothing.

337
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:54,286
You kill a bee, then maybe the flower
it was going to pollinate doesn't grow

338
00:20:54,495 --> 00:20:57,164
and its seeds don't get spread

339
00:20:57,414 --> 00:20:59,750
and the animal that was going to

340
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,793
eat the vegetation can't,
and it dies,

341
00:21:02,002 --> 00:21:04,129
and it was carrying genes
for a new kind

342
00:21:04,338 --> 00:21:06,006
of animal that doesn't occur

343
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:09,635
and it alters the course of evolution.
A single bee.

344
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:13,764
The farther back,
the more catastrophic changes could be.

345
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:15,849
So, rule number one?

346
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:17,142
Don't change anything.

347
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:20,187
Hey. Brass balls, remember?

348
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,665
Everyone, visors down.

349
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,797
This is a com check.
Everyone hearing me okay?

350
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,590
- Ryer, check.
- Krase, check.

351
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,676
- Derris, check.
- Lucas, check.

352
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:51,760
Check.

353
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,638
Tell him you can hear him.

354
00:21:55,764 --> 00:21:57,474
Okay, follow me.

355
00:22:20,497 --> 00:22:21,582
Hands to your side.

356
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,761
Oh my God, it's so tight.
I can't move.

357
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:36,430
Why so tight?

358
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:38,849
We are going to enter
the virtual receiver.

359
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:42,477
You've got to stay still or the particle
beam will not hit the right spot.

360
00:22:42,686 --> 00:22:44,521
You want all those atoms winding up

361
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,940
in the same place
and as the same people.

362
00:22:58,994 --> 00:23:00,704
If you feel disoriented,

363
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,499
concentrate on your heartbeat,
it'll calm you down.

364
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,211
And whatever you do,
don't look into the light!

365
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,128
What?

366
00:23:09,129 --> 00:23:11,256
Just kidding.
This is supposed to be fun.

367
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:14,426
Let's go get him!

368
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,303
- Everyone okay?
- Yeah, we're both fine.

369
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,265
Remember, don't touch anything.

370
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:21,326
- Something up, Mr. Eckles?
- My gun doesn't work!

371
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,370
That's a safety feature.
They won't fire until

372
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:26,165
- Travis fires first.
- Why the hell not?

373
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,709
To keep clients from
shooting things they shouldn't.

374
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:31,795
Derris, let's not mention this
in our report.

375
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,089
- No harm, no foul.
- Appreciate it.

376
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:36,758
I'm not that big of a dick.
I just like to talk.

377
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,887
Eckles is barely holding it together.
BP's through the roof,

378
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:42,181
breathing's shallow. Watch him.

379
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:43,974
This animal's big, right?

380
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,059
Better be for this money.

381
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,896
Check it out.

382
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:52,232
That's him, isn't it?

383
00:24:52,441 --> 00:24:54,234
- Guys, remember...
- Is that him?

384
00:24:54,568 --> 00:24:56,069
...wait for my command.

385
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:00,324
Whatever happens,
do not step off of the path.

386
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,287
Holy...

387
00:25:05,913 --> 00:25:06,830
Cute, isn't he?

388
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:14,755
Get a grip, Ted!

389
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,801
All right, big guy.

390
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:20,886
Three steps.

391
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:28,685
Now turn your head to the right.

392
00:25:31,814 --> 00:25:32,606
Wait! Not yet.

393
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:36,360
Hold it.

394
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:39,822
Hold it!

395
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:42,282
Now!

396
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,369
Jenny, take the shot!

397
00:25:49,957 --> 00:25:51,667
Payne, we got a major problem here!

398
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,714
The designator shorted out! The safety
won't release on the other guns!

399
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,008
- Fix it!
- Even if I could, it'll take time!

400
00:26:00,217 --> 00:26:01,218
We don't have time!

401
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:04,263
Cut it out, for Christ's sake!

402
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:06,640
This is part of the show, right?

403
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:08,767
Over here! Try and get me!

404
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,603
Come on, you bastard, take me on!

405
00:26:11,895 --> 00:26:13,647
Get behind the bushes!

406
00:26:14,815 --> 00:26:16,817
That's right! Come and get me!

407
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:21,029
- Get behind the bushes!
- We're not going alone!

408
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:22,948
You guys, run! Take off!

409
00:26:23,157 --> 00:26:24,867
Get behind him!

410
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:30,497
Over here! Take me on!

411
00:26:31,498 --> 00:26:33,417
Come on! Over here, you asshole!

412
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:41,717
- Shit!
- Over here, big guy! Yo! Yo!

413
00:26:41,925 --> 00:26:42,968
Jenny, no!

414
00:26:43,886 --> 00:26:45,345
Jenny, get down!

415
00:26:47,097 --> 00:26:48,182
Go, yo!

416
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:52,186
Come on, over this way! Over here.

417
00:26:52,936 --> 00:26:53,854
Come for me!

418
00:26:54,062 --> 00:26:55,147
Jenny, go!

419
00:26:55,898 --> 00:26:58,025
- Payne, my gun!
- I got it!

420
00:26:58,233 --> 00:27:00,861
Over here! Look at me!

421
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:02,154
Now try it!

422
00:27:28,931 --> 00:27:31,892
Don't you ever
pull a stunt like that again!

423
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,187
If anyone dies to save someone's rich,
fat ass, it'll be me. Got it?

424
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:37,898
Where are the clients?

425
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:41,485
Let's go.

426
00:27:42,444 --> 00:27:43,487
Anyone hurt?

427
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:44,696
They're fine.

428
00:27:47,449 --> 00:27:48,492
You sure he's dead?

429
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,246
- You want to check his pulse, Ted?
- He fell right where he was supposed to.

430
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,248
You got lucky.

431
00:27:54,498 --> 00:27:56,667
Did anyone break any protocols?

432
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:58,502
Then we're clean.

433
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,504
- Travis, the volcano.
- We better get going.

434
00:28:00,963 --> 00:28:01,839
Follow me.

435
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:25,988
By the time I'm done suing you,
I am going to own this joint!

436
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:27,948
That's your right, Mr. Middleton.

437
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,159
I understand you're upset.

438
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:32,286
But look beyond
your immediate feelings.

439
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:34,705
Look at what you achieved today.

440
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,915
I almost achieved getting eaten!

441
00:28:37,124 --> 00:28:38,458
And you weren't.

442
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:41,086
Countless clients
have jumped back through time

443
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:44,298
faced the allosaurus, and gone home

444
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:47,467
proud that they cheated death.
And in reality, they cheated nothing.

445
00:28:47,676 --> 00:28:50,512
It was elaborate, expensive,
authentic, and a fantasy.

446
00:28:50,721 --> 00:28:51,763
It was controlled.

447
00:28:51,972 --> 00:28:54,349
The outcome never in doubt.
Not for a moment.

448
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:55,601
You two.

449
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:59,021
Circumstances were thrust upon you,
like all moments of great courage.

450
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:02,858
Sue me if you want to,
but for Christ's sake,

451
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:05,152
look at what you two did today.

452
00:29:05,986 --> 00:29:08,614
You faced death for real!
All controls off

453
00:29:08,822 --> 00:29:10,199
and you survived!

454
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,243
You stood shoulder-to-shoulder,
Columbus...

455
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:14,703
Jesus.

456
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,081
...discovering America,
Armstrong walking on the moon,

457
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,001
Brubaker landing on Mars!

458
00:29:24,254 --> 00:29:26,465
You are true pioneers!

459
00:29:28,091 --> 00:29:29,176
Gentlemen,

460
00:29:30,928 --> 00:29:31,929
I salute you.

461
00:29:48,862 --> 00:29:51,907
I swear, that dude could sell
art lessons to a blind man.

462
00:29:52,449 --> 00:29:53,659
So what happened?

463
00:29:55,202 --> 00:29:57,162
Moisture damage. A leak

464
00:29:57,371 --> 00:29:59,164
from a broken box of nitrogen bullets.

465
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:00,999
I tested the gun before we jumped,

466
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:02,918
but the short occurred after.

467
00:30:03,126 --> 00:30:06,004
We have to change our whole procedure.
This cannot happen again.

468
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,549
It was an accident, you know?

469
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:11,760
We cannot have accidents.

470
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:14,763
While I was a physics major in college,

471
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:18,892
we studied something called
the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

472
00:30:19,476 --> 00:30:21,520
It proves that there is no such thing

473
00:30:21,728 --> 00:30:24,148
as zero tolerance. It doesn't exist.

474
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:27,985
You basically can't be
a hundred percent sure of anything.

475
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,779
No matter how hard you try, accidents...

476
00:30:30,988 --> 00:30:32,114
...happen.

477
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:35,159
We can't have accidents.

478
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:50,090
Good evening, Dr. Ryer.
How about this weather?

479
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:52,759
I guess this is
what they call Indian summer.

480
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,179
70 degrees... in November!

481
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:57,806
It's different, that's for sure.

482
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:16,575
<i>Unseasonably hot weather continues
today with highs in the upper 80s.</i>

483
00:31:16,783 --> 00:31:18,535
<i>The skies will be clear</i>

484
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:21,079
<i>and the humidity
will remain around 90 percent.</i>

485
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:24,291
<i>Thousands of fish beached themselves
on the shore of Lake Michigan overnight.</i>

486
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,878
<i>Scientists from the University
of Chicago are investigating.</i>

487
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,839
<i>They're at a loss to explain
what caused the phenomenon.</i>

488
00:31:31,048 --> 00:31:33,759
<i>The beaching provides an opportunity
for amateur fishermen,</i>

489
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:36,428
<i>but wait until
the cause is determined</i>

490
00:31:36,637 --> 00:31:38,764
<i>before you eat your catch.</i>

491
00:31:38,972 --> 00:31:41,433
<i>Suicidal fish. That's a new one.</i>

492
00:31:41,642 --> 00:31:42,601
<i>The Health Department says</i>

493
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:45,020
<i>that the UV count is extremely high,</i>

494
00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:47,272
<i>so if you want to soak up</i>

495
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:49,900
<i>this amazing
warm sunshine in November,</i>

496
00:31:50,192 --> 00:31:51,527
<i>you'd better protect yourself.</i>

497
00:31:51,693 --> 00:31:54,613
<i>An SPF of 45
or stronger is recommended.</i>

498
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:05,666
What happened here?

499
00:32:05,874 --> 00:32:07,000
Check it out.

500
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:09,545
This wall's at least
three feet thick.

501
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:11,880
That plant
must've really wanted out, huh?

502
00:32:21,932 --> 00:32:22,850
Sorry.

503
00:32:23,058 --> 00:32:24,560
What? You've seen me skinny-dipping.

504
00:32:25,018 --> 00:32:26,019
You were eight.

505
00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:27,187
Get over it.

506
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:30,941
When did you become such a brat?

507
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:33,652
You ready for this today?

508
00:32:33,861 --> 00:32:36,405
You know what they say
about falling off a horse?

509
00:32:36,572 --> 00:32:37,531
Take a cab?

510
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:39,074
Get right back on.

511
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:42,703
What if your horse weighs
12,000 pounds and tries to eat you?

512
00:32:44,621 --> 00:32:46,582
Everyone, everyone!

513
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:50,627
Mr. Zong, Mr. Chang,
get ready for the ride of your lives!

514
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:54,506
Travis! Don't you want to say
something about the light?

515
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:58,927
Gentlemen,
please don't look at the lights.

516
00:33:01,138 --> 00:33:02,389
Whatever.

517
00:33:02,973 --> 00:33:05,184
All right. Let's do this.

518
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,959
You feel it?

519
00:33:31,168 --> 00:33:32,503
Something's off.

520
00:33:33,962 --> 00:33:35,380
Something's different.

521
00:33:41,011 --> 00:33:43,305
Travis! Look!

522
00:33:51,522 --> 00:33:52,564
Oh, my God.

523
00:33:52,773 --> 00:33:53,690
What is noise?

524
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:55,651
Back to the portal! Now!

525
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:57,986
Everybody get back! Move!

526
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,948
Get them back to the portal now!

527
00:34:01,156 --> 00:34:02,616
Come on, let's go! Hurry!

528
00:34:02,825 --> 00:34:04,326
Move! Get back!

529
00:34:04,493 --> 00:34:05,744
Jenny, leave it!

530
00:34:05,953 --> 00:34:08,580
When the path retracts,
it'll fall! On the ground!

531
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,917
Get them back to the portal now!

532
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:14,837
Let's go, Jenny! Come on!

533
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:16,705
I said, let's go!

534
00:34:16,713 --> 00:34:18,715
I can do this! Calm down!

535
00:34:20,717 --> 00:34:21,593
Keep moving!

536
00:34:23,303 --> 00:34:24,012
Run!

537
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:25,848
Jenny, run!

538
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:40,279
Lucas! What the hell
just happened back there?

539
00:34:40,487 --> 00:34:42,573
TAMI missed her entry point
by five minutes!

540
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:45,033
- We were late!
- Make sure everyone's all right.

541
00:34:45,242 --> 00:34:47,578
TAMI has never been off
by a millisecond before.

542
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:50,038
TAMI, why were you off
in your calculations?

543
00:34:50,247 --> 00:34:51,832
<i>Please be specific, Dr. Ryer.</i>

544
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,210
On our last jump, you missed
our entry point by five minutes.

545
00:34:55,419 --> 00:34:57,588
<i>- Why?
- I'm afraid you're mistaken, Doctor.</i>

546
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:01,466
<i>My calculations were precise. You were
sent to the correct coordinates.</i>

547
00:35:01,675 --> 00:35:02,801
We need to talk.

548
00:35:10,392 --> 00:35:12,519
We've just stepped
into a world of trouble.

549
00:35:12,728 --> 00:35:15,063
She was off by five minutes,
out of 65 million years.

550
00:35:15,272 --> 00:35:17,149
It's a minor glitch.
We can fix it.

551
00:35:17,357 --> 00:35:18,817
I had to file a report.

552
00:35:19,026 --> 00:35:20,903
Jeez, Clay,
you didn't have to do that.

553
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:22,821
I had no alternative.

554
00:35:23,197 --> 00:35:25,157
Of course you had an alternative.

555
00:35:25,365 --> 00:35:28,118
You could have thought big
instead of little, which is all

556
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:31,121
your pea-brain is capable of
before it explodes.

557
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,749
Now you get to cause me grief
just because you can.

558
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:36,418
History's not a class struggle,
it's a vision struggle.

559
00:35:36,627 --> 00:35:39,463
It's people like me trying to get free
from narrow-minded pricks like you.

560
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,216
Nothing moves without us,
we're the goddamned engine.

561
00:35:42,424 --> 00:35:45,594
- This is out of my hands now.
- Like hell it is.

562
00:35:45,802 --> 00:35:49,056
You know that regulations dictate
that this meeting has to be recorded.

563
00:35:49,264 --> 00:35:50,182
Of course.

564
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:54,520
The Temporal Regulation Division

565
00:35:54,728 --> 00:35:56,605
proclaims this facility closed.

566
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:02,027
TAMI...

567
00:36:02,236 --> 00:36:03,153
<i>ItAL Access denied.</i>

568
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,198
They don't waste time.

569
00:36:27,344 --> 00:36:29,263
You can't ask me to do that.

570
00:36:29,471 --> 00:36:31,682
I'm not asking you to do anything!

571
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,644
I'm simply reminding you of the
potential delicacy of our situation.

572
00:36:35,853 --> 00:36:36,603
What's done is done.

573
00:36:36,812 --> 00:36:39,064
Even I have my limits. I can't.

574
00:36:42,442 --> 00:36:45,404
We can't leave this
to some government agency

575
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:47,239
to figure out.

576
00:36:47,447 --> 00:36:49,241
Why not? It's their job.

577
00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:50,492
They're bureaucrats.

578
00:36:50,701 --> 00:36:53,370
If they fell out of a window, it would
take them a week to hit the ground.

579
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,664
Do you have any idea
how long it would take them

580
00:36:55,873 --> 00:36:57,791
to clear this up?

581
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,711
They'll have TAMI shut down for months.
I'll go bankrupt.

582
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,921
What happened today
has to be connected to our last jump.

583
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,716
- We must have changed something.
- You just made that up.

584
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:07,676
Something happened back there.
I know it.

585
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:10,554
Really? You know it?
You don't know anything of the kind!

586
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:13,599
I'll tell you what,
there is someone who does know.

587
00:37:53,514 --> 00:37:54,723
You okay, man?

588
00:38:27,548 --> 00:38:29,132
We represent the tenant board.

589
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:31,635
We have vines growing
into our windows, down the halls,

590
00:38:31,844 --> 00:38:33,595
one broke the elevator!

591
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:35,931
Open this door at once!

592
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:36,849
Dr. Rand!

593
00:38:37,057 --> 00:38:39,351
This is loaded! Now back off!

594
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,602
She's crazy!

595
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:42,104
You're crazy!

596
00:38:49,736 --> 00:38:51,321
Dr. Rand, I need...

597
00:38:58,662 --> 00:39:00,914
Excuse me.
Where are you delivering that?

598
00:39:01,415 --> 00:39:03,208
Rand. 7-E.

599
00:39:06,295 --> 00:39:08,422
I told you, I'm not responsible.

600
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,215
Look outside,
it's happening out there, too.

601
00:39:10,424 --> 00:39:12,801
Use your brain
while you still have one.

602
00:39:13,427 --> 00:39:14,678
Fertilizer.

603
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:20,225
Lady, it's real heavy.

604
00:39:23,979 --> 00:39:24,897
Close the door.

605
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,159
Put it by the rhododendron.

606
00:39:39,286 --> 00:39:41,288
The white flowers.

607
00:39:43,123 --> 00:39:44,333
Then go.

608
00:39:47,669 --> 00:39:49,463
I thought I recognized your voice.

609
00:39:49,671 --> 00:39:53,300
You sound just like TAMI.
Although, she's a little nicer.

610
00:39:53,509 --> 00:39:56,345
That thing doesn't work.
It's an antique.

611
00:39:57,804 --> 00:39:59,223
I've been expecting you.

612
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:01,183
I'm afraid we've done it.
What you warned us about.

613
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:02,935
- I knew it.
- What do you mean?

614
00:40:03,143 --> 00:40:06,021
- Don't I seem a little on edge?
- About the same as last time.

615
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,148
How far back?

616
00:40:08,357 --> 00:40:09,358
The Cretaceous.

617
00:40:09,566 --> 00:40:11,193
Jesus. And what did you change?

618
00:40:11,401 --> 00:40:14,071
We don't know. As far as we can tell,
no one stepped off the path.

619
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:15,614
The animal fell in the kill zone.

620
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:19,243
The kill zone, the path.
The kill zone, the path.

621
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:20,869
You're so blind.

622
00:40:21,078 --> 00:40:22,871
24 hours, isn't it?
Since you got back.

623
00:40:24,206 --> 00:40:25,207
Yeah, almost exactly.

624
00:40:25,415 --> 00:40:26,416
- Why?
- Watch this.

625
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,516
Son-of-a-bitch.

626
00:40:56,947 --> 00:40:58,991
- That was you.
- What the hell was that?

627
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:02,369
A time wave. So much
for your system being bulletproof.

628
00:41:13,797 --> 00:41:14,715
Jesus.

629
00:41:18,385 --> 00:41:20,304
Let's go. Get moving!

630
00:41:41,074 --> 00:41:44,369
- What is that pipe for?
- Water for the oxygen condensers.

631
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:53,587
Over there, get over there!

632
00:41:57,549 --> 00:41:58,634
The oxygen!

633
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,344
Come on!

634
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,237
You okay?

635
00:42:25,536 --> 00:42:26,870
Look at this!

636
00:42:29,289 --> 00:42:32,835
This tree was never here before.
It's extraordinary.

637
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:35,170
It's okay.

638
00:42:50,727 --> 00:42:53,522
I think the window's our best bet.

639
00:42:59,194 --> 00:43:02,656
Jesus. Why didn't this happen
until now? Why the delay?

640
00:43:02,865 --> 00:43:05,826
When you change something in the past,
the future isn't affected all at once.

641
00:43:06,034 --> 00:43:09,371
Changes come in ripples,
like dropping a stone into a pond.

642
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,456
So you mean there'll be more of these.

643
00:43:11,665 --> 00:43:13,959
And they'll get bigger and bigger.

644
00:43:14,168 --> 00:43:18,130
All the changes in evolution
that you affected will come in the waves.

645
00:43:18,297 --> 00:43:20,924
It'll start with climate,
then vegetation,

646
00:43:21,091 --> 00:43:22,718
the early manifestations of life.

647
00:43:22,926 --> 00:43:25,387
Then come the more complex organisms.

648
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:29,892
- So what will happen in the last wave?
- It'll be us.

649
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,059
We wave goodbye.

650
00:43:31,268 --> 00:43:34,104
Last wave changes
the last species to evolve,

651
00:43:34,313 --> 00:43:37,024
Homo sapiens.
God knows what we'll become.

652
00:43:37,232 --> 00:43:39,318
We may have no eyes,
we may be sea creatures.

653
00:43:39,526 --> 00:43:43,155
We may not exist at all. We don't have
too many more waves before that one.

654
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,532
Can we fix what we did?

655
00:43:45,741 --> 00:43:48,327
I don't know. Maybe.

656
00:43:57,669 --> 00:43:59,671
There's no way
I can allow another jump.

657
00:44:00,214 --> 00:44:01,590
I'll lose my badge.

658
00:44:02,257 --> 00:44:05,552
If we don't fix this, you won't have
a chest to pin that badge on, moron.

659
00:44:05,761 --> 00:44:08,597
Careful, you don't want
to start calling people names.

660
00:44:08,806 --> 00:44:12,059
- She says it's the easiest way.
- No, I said it was the only way.

661
00:44:12,267 --> 00:44:13,268
I also said I would help.

662
00:44:13,477 --> 00:44:15,437
I didn't say I would be
in the same room with you.

663
00:44:15,646 --> 00:44:17,231
Hold on. I go back

664
00:44:17,439 --> 00:44:19,817
to just before
the original hunting party arrives,

665
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:23,195
meet them when they step
out of the portal and turn them back.

666
00:44:23,403 --> 00:44:25,531
Whatever went wrong never happens.

667
00:44:25,739 --> 00:44:27,241
Things go back to normal.

668
00:44:27,449 --> 00:44:30,244
- How can we be sure it'll work?
- We can't be sure if it'll work,

669
00:44:30,452 --> 00:44:33,205
but we can be sure
doing nothing will not work.

670
00:44:39,419 --> 00:44:41,004
No. I'm sorry.

671
00:44:43,799 --> 00:44:45,676
The whole of time
has been turned upside down

672
00:44:45,884 --> 00:44:48,136
and you're running around
with your toothbrush,

673
00:44:48,345 --> 00:44:49,721
worrying about your pension.

674
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,808
We have more than just
a software problem on our hands.

675
00:44:52,975 --> 00:44:54,726
We have got to fix this

676
00:44:54,893 --> 00:44:58,063
...and we have to make sure
no one ever finds out about it.

677
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:01,817
If I go down,
I'm not going down alone.

678
00:45:08,824 --> 00:45:10,826
Can you compensate
for TAMI's margin of error

679
00:45:11,034 --> 00:45:12,744
so he gets where he has to go?

680
00:45:12,953 --> 00:45:14,705
Well, I built her.

681
00:45:21,003 --> 00:45:22,254
How's that?

682
00:45:24,381 --> 00:45:27,885
I want every moment
of this jump recorded, understand?

683
00:46:28,032 --> 00:46:31,118
Another time wave is coming! Hang on!

684
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:51,680
Is everyone all right?

685
00:46:54,266 --> 00:46:55,976
Lucas, make sure everyone's okay.

686
00:46:56,811 --> 00:46:57,770
Give me your hand.

687
00:46:59,563 --> 00:47:02,233
Let's see
if the backup generator works.

688
00:47:47,736 --> 00:47:49,947
The power is out all over the city.

689
00:47:50,197 --> 00:47:52,700
Power's probably out
all over the world.

690
00:47:53,784 --> 00:47:54,994
Why couldn't I get back?

691
00:47:55,161 --> 00:47:57,496
You weren't able
to jump through the time wave.

692
00:47:59,373 --> 00:48:02,126
Remember, I explained
it's like a ripple in a pond.

693
00:48:02,543 --> 00:48:04,336
We can't break through the rings.

694
00:48:04,545 --> 00:48:08,090
We seem to be stuck ahead
of the changes that are occurring.

695
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:10,342
What do we do?
Jesus Christ, what do we do?

696
00:48:10,551 --> 00:48:12,011
Let me work on it.

697
00:48:12,219 --> 00:48:13,679
This is not a time for panic.

698
00:48:13,888 --> 00:48:16,182
Actually, as times for panic go,
this is right up there.

699
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:19,852
What we need to do is take a look at
the jump and find out what was changed.

700
00:48:43,876 --> 00:48:46,545
That was nothing.
I was standing right there.

701
00:48:46,754 --> 00:48:48,547
<i>That's a safety feature.</i>

702
00:48:48,756 --> 00:48:51,592
<i>They're all tied to Travis's gun,
won't fire until he fires first.</i>

703
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,676
<i>Why the hell not?</i>

704
00:48:52,885 --> 00:48:55,429
<i>To keep clients from shooting
things they shouldn't.</i>

705
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,141
<i>Derris, how about
we don't mention this in our report?</i>

706
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,684
<i>No harm, no foul.</i>

707
00:49:00,893 --> 00:49:02,228
<i>Appreciate it.</i>

708
00:49:02,645 --> 00:49:03,562
Go forward.

709
00:49:06,023 --> 00:49:07,024
Let's see that.

710
00:49:07,691 --> 00:49:09,568
<i>Over here!
Try and get me!</i>

711
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,321
<i>Get out of here!</i>

712
00:49:12,988 --> 00:49:14,865
<i>Get behind the bushes!</i>

713
00:49:15,074 --> 00:49:16,784
<i>We're not going alone!</i>

714
00:49:19,328 --> 00:49:21,205
<i>Get behind the bushes!
Over here!</i>

715
00:49:21,413 --> 00:49:22,915
Can we follow them down the path?

716
00:49:23,123 --> 00:49:25,417
Once they're out of range of my recorder,
there's no way to see them.

717
00:49:25,626 --> 00:49:27,378
Speed up again to after the kill.

718
00:49:33,676 --> 00:49:35,469
<i>Travis, the volcano!</i>

719
00:49:35,678 --> 00:49:36,720
<i>We better get going.</i>

720
00:49:36,929 --> 00:49:38,013
<i>Follow me.</i>

721
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,434
Anybody see anything?

722
00:49:42,643 --> 00:49:45,396
Anything small
that may have fallen off one of us?

723
00:49:55,114 --> 00:49:55,990
Nothing.

724
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:10,504
Boys and girls,
I think I found something.

725
00:50:10,713 --> 00:50:12,756
You're not gonna believe this,

726
00:50:12,965 --> 00:50:14,925
but, according to the physical log,

727
00:50:15,134 --> 00:50:18,012
when we came back we weighed
1.3 grams more than when we left.

728
00:50:18,804 --> 00:50:20,139
What does that mean?

729
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:22,725
It means we brought something back.

730
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:25,728
No, it's impossible.
There's the bio-filter.

731
00:50:25,936 --> 00:50:29,023
No organic matter
can pass through the...

732
00:50:29,732 --> 00:50:32,526
We never needed it.
We've always been so careful.

733
00:50:34,612 --> 00:50:35,613
You turned it off?

734
00:50:36,697 --> 00:50:38,199
You turned the bio-filter off?

735
00:50:38,866 --> 00:50:42,453
It takes a lot of energy. It costs
a fortune and we never needed it.

736
00:50:42,661 --> 00:50:44,538
My God. Are you insane?

737
00:50:45,664 --> 00:50:47,208
Did you know about this?

738
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:49,126
Of course not.

739
00:50:54,798 --> 00:50:56,592
Why does this not surprise me?

740
00:50:58,344 --> 00:51:01,180
We need to find out
what you brought back.

741
00:51:05,768 --> 00:51:07,228
Did you get through?

742
00:51:07,436 --> 00:51:11,315
Line's busy. It'll be Forrest on
with one of his pals.

743
00:51:12,691 --> 00:51:16,028
Donna will be freaking out,
all her yard work down the drain.

744
00:51:16,487 --> 00:51:17,446
Do you buy it for a minute?

745
00:51:17,655 --> 00:51:18,739
The great asshole-in-the-sky

746
00:51:18,948 --> 00:51:21,867
doesn't check the bio-filter once?

747
00:51:22,076 --> 00:51:24,036
Nothing gets by that freak.

748
00:51:24,203 --> 00:51:26,121
"Two years and I'll be out. "
That's what he told me.

749
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,875
Got a little touchy when I asked him
how he'll retire on a government salary.

750
00:51:30,084 --> 00:51:31,752
You think Hatton paid him off?

751
00:51:31,961 --> 00:51:35,840
It would be worth it... all the money
he saved on running that filter.

752
00:51:37,341 --> 00:51:40,052
Clean. That's the last one.

753
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,305
It's gotta be on the clothes
on one of the clients.

754
00:51:43,514 --> 00:51:46,934
Somebody must have panicked
and stepped off the path.

755
00:51:47,143 --> 00:51:48,060
The sweaty guy.

756
00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:49,061
Eckles.

757
00:51:50,729 --> 00:51:51,647
Eckles.

758
00:51:51,856 --> 00:51:55,651
I have an idea to get you back.
It's never been tried, but it might work.

759
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,321
We can't break through the rings,
but I should be able to open a wormhole

760
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,407
on the other side of the ripples.

761
00:52:01,615 --> 00:52:04,827
Instead of 65 million years,
you go back 65 million and one.

762
00:52:05,035 --> 00:52:08,497
- It would be like jumping over the rings.
- And then what? Travis waits for them?

763
00:52:08,706 --> 00:52:10,040
Back here,
the change hasn't happened yet,

764
00:52:10,249 --> 00:52:12,710
so there are no time waves.

765
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,171
I should be able to slingshot you
forward to the target zone.

766
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:18,591
- You "should"? You're not sure?
- I'm fairly certain.

767
00:52:18,841 --> 00:52:21,635
But don't intercept the party
to turn them back.

768
00:52:21,802 --> 00:52:23,012
Why not?

769
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,014
The slingshot effect
will use up all your energy.

770
00:52:25,222 --> 00:52:27,641
Your window will be small
and highly unstable.

771
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:30,269
You won't have time to explain what
you're doing, let alone convince them.

772
00:52:30,478 --> 00:52:31,353
How much time will I have?

773
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:34,648
I can't say for certain.
15, 20 seconds.

774
00:52:34,899 --> 00:52:36,233
Can you say anything for certain?

775
00:52:36,442 --> 00:52:38,736
Yes, I can say for certain
I can't say anything for certain.

776
00:52:38,944 --> 00:52:42,490
Let's find out what we're trying
to prevent, because you won't have time.

777
00:52:42,698 --> 00:52:43,991
We better talk to Mr. Eckles.

778
00:52:44,742 --> 00:52:46,619
It'll have to be in person.

779
00:52:47,328 --> 00:52:48,412
Nothing.

780
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:50,039
Dead.

781
00:52:56,629 --> 00:52:58,047
Where are the guards?

782
00:53:00,841 --> 00:53:01,842
What's that?

783
00:53:03,928 --> 00:53:04,970
My God.

784
00:53:09,558 --> 00:53:12,436
You're all loaded. Designators are off.
You can shoot at will.

785
00:53:15,648 --> 00:53:17,650
- Who told you to distribute weapons?
- I did.

786
00:53:17,858 --> 00:53:18,859
Just one thing. Plants like this

787
00:53:19,068 --> 00:53:21,987
- haven't grown in millions of years.
- We're shooting at plants?

788
00:53:22,196 --> 00:53:25,449
It isn't exactly like it was then.
It's stronger, more developed.

789
00:53:25,658 --> 00:53:28,244
The alternate reality
taking over outside that door

790
00:53:28,452 --> 00:53:29,954
has been evolving uninterrupted
for 60 million years.

791
00:53:30,955 --> 00:53:33,791
Are you suggesting
that there are dinosaurs out there?

792
00:53:33,999 --> 00:53:35,960
I doubt it. More likely,
whatever they've evolved into.

793
00:53:36,168 --> 00:53:37,753
That's one hell of a "just one thing".

794
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,674
This building is still under government
control. I can't leave TAMI unattended.

795
00:53:41,882 --> 00:53:42,800
Of course not.

796
00:53:43,968 --> 00:53:46,178
We all set? Let's go.

797
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:06,824
Eckles lives
on the other side of the park.

798
00:54:07,032 --> 00:54:09,285
Wouldn't it be quicker going around?
Sticking to the streets?

799
00:54:09,493 --> 00:54:11,203
- What streets?
- Good point.

800
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:53,829
Guys?

801
00:54:59,752 --> 00:55:01,337
That thing was huge.

802
00:55:06,967 --> 00:55:08,552
Let's keep moving.

803
00:55:34,203 --> 00:55:35,287
Trav, you better take a look.

804
00:55:35,871 --> 00:55:36,914
They're all over.

805
00:55:37,122 --> 00:55:39,750
Big mothers, judging by the depth.
Couple hundred pounds.

806
00:55:39,959 --> 00:55:41,335
These aren't classic reptilian.

807
00:55:41,544 --> 00:55:45,297
There are other markings. A little bit
of primate mixed in. I don't know.

808
00:55:45,714 --> 00:55:46,674
That's not good.

809
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:50,636
It means we're not more than a couple
of waves away from being changed ourselves.

810
00:55:50,803 --> 00:55:52,138
I suggest we get the hell out of here.

811
00:55:53,222 --> 00:55:54,557
Let's go.

812
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,361
What do you think? Do we go around?

813
00:56:08,487 --> 00:56:09,738
What was that?

814
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:12,783
I have got to get home.

815
00:56:18,205 --> 00:56:19,231
Lucas!

816
00:56:19,356 --> 00:56:20,240
Get them out!

817
00:56:20,249 --> 00:56:21,375
Get these thorns out of him.

818
00:56:24,295 --> 00:56:25,045
Calm down!

819
00:56:25,337 --> 00:56:27,006
- Travis?
- Hold your fire!

820
00:56:27,214 --> 00:56:29,592
Whatever's out there has been tracking
us since we entered the park!

821
00:56:31,635 --> 00:56:32,845
Man, it hurts.

822
00:56:33,053 --> 00:56:35,556
Come on, Marcus.
Try slowing your pulse rate down.

823
00:56:35,764 --> 00:56:39,310
It'll slow the progress of what those
brambles put into your bloodstream.

824
00:56:39,518 --> 00:56:43,105
Whatever those thorns
put in my bloodstream,

825
00:56:43,314 --> 00:56:45,107
it's already working.

826
00:56:45,649 --> 00:56:47,318
I can't feel my legs.

827
00:56:47,485 --> 00:56:49,403
Watch out for these!

828
00:56:49,695 --> 00:56:50,654
Man, I'm losing it.

829
00:57:08,422 --> 00:57:09,632
Everything's...

830
00:57:10,591 --> 00:57:12,009
getting really weird.

831
00:57:17,723 --> 00:57:18,974
Take care of him.

832
00:57:57,638 --> 00:57:59,140
Come on. You okay?

833
00:57:59,348 --> 00:58:00,307
Get up, let's go!

834
00:58:13,988 --> 00:58:16,115
Head for the bridge now! Go!

835
00:58:16,991 --> 00:58:18,492
Aim for their throats!

836
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:21,036
It's their only soft spot!
Aim for their throats!

837
00:58:28,335 --> 00:58:29,378
Go!

838
00:58:31,297 --> 00:58:32,089
Go on, I'll hold them off.

839
00:58:36,552 --> 00:58:38,596
I'm not gonna leave you. Let's go.

840
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:40,973
Travis, those thorns.

841
00:58:41,849 --> 00:58:43,100
I can't make it.

842
00:58:44,018 --> 00:58:46,979
I can't and you know it.
And I know it.

843
00:58:47,897 --> 00:58:50,441
Just set things right,
and I'll be fine.

844
00:58:50,941 --> 00:58:51,859
See?

845
00:58:54,236 --> 00:58:55,029
Just set things right.

846
00:58:55,237 --> 00:58:56,197
I'll fix it.

847
00:58:58,282 --> 00:58:59,200
Go!

848
00:58:59,408 --> 00:59:00,868
- What about Payne?
- I said go!

849
00:59:17,301 --> 00:59:18,511
Why is he staying there?

850
00:59:19,512 --> 00:59:20,721
- Payne!
- Marcus!

851
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,223
- Payne, come on!
- Now go!

852
00:59:34,902 --> 00:59:35,903
Forrest?

853
00:59:37,321 --> 00:59:40,407
Look, Forrest, that's Orion.

854
00:59:40,991 --> 00:59:42,910
Those stars there make his belt.

855
00:59:43,536 --> 00:59:45,496
I'll get you
a telescope when you're nine.

856
00:59:45,955 --> 00:59:48,123
That's when Grandpa got me mine.

857
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:51,961
Forrest. Know what those are?

858
00:59:55,172 --> 00:59:56,090
That's right,

859
00:59:57,424 --> 00:59:59,343
the Seven Sisters.

860
00:59:59,552 --> 01:00:01,512
Look like stars, don't they?

861
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:07,685
But each one is a whole entire galaxy.

862
01:00:27,788 --> 01:00:30,207
I know how you feel.
I feel it, too.

863
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,670
But if we fix this,
then he'll be right back with us.

864
01:00:35,504 --> 01:00:38,174
So let's keep moving. Eckles's place
is still two blocks to the north.

865
01:00:38,382 --> 01:00:40,634
- What are you gonna do about it?
- What are you talking about?

866
01:00:41,469 --> 01:00:42,970
It can't ever happen again.

867
01:00:43,179 --> 01:00:46,765
If we're lucky enough to fix things,
it'll go back to the way it was before.

868
01:00:46,974 --> 01:00:49,643
We have to stop it, the Hattons,
Time Safari, the whole thing.

869
01:00:49,852 --> 01:00:51,479
If we fix the time line, though,

870
01:00:51,687 --> 01:00:54,148
when we come back, we won't know
any of this has happened.

871
01:00:54,398 --> 01:00:56,108
So now you see the problem.

872
01:01:10,372 --> 01:01:12,833
At least it means there's still
some people alive in there.

873
01:01:13,042 --> 01:01:15,794
- I think we can get down here.
- Those creatures back there are smart.

874
01:01:16,003 --> 01:01:17,838
A lot smarter than us
if we don't get over this wall.

875
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:19,340
Wait.

876
01:01:34,313 --> 01:01:35,773
There's got to be
something around here.

877
01:01:36,482 --> 01:01:37,191
You see anything over there?

878
01:01:42,363 --> 01:01:43,113
What's this?

879
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,366
I got something.

880
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:47,076
What the...

881
01:01:57,419 --> 01:01:58,445
Daddy!

882
01:02:07,972 --> 01:02:09,890
It's okay, stay where you are.

883
01:02:29,285 --> 01:02:31,036
All right. It's okay.

884
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:42,173
We don't have room.

885
01:02:42,381 --> 01:02:43,924
- He saved their lives!
- Go somewhere else.

886
01:02:44,133 --> 01:02:46,177
Either let us in or kill us.

887
01:02:55,853 --> 01:02:58,481
We just need to find
someone and then we'll go.

888
01:02:59,523 --> 01:03:01,275
Ted Eckles.

889
01:03:02,943 --> 01:03:05,905
He lives in this building.
Does anyone know where we can find him?

890
01:03:09,366 --> 01:03:10,618
Apartment 6-A.

891
01:03:12,036 --> 01:03:14,288
When we're done, we'll get you food.

892
01:03:34,809 --> 01:03:37,937
- No! That's Ally's.
- The fire's going out.

893
01:03:38,145 --> 01:03:39,063
Not that!

894
01:03:39,271 --> 01:03:41,106
- Mr. Eckles.
- Who the hell are you?

895
01:03:41,315 --> 01:03:42,483
Remember me?

896
01:03:42,691 --> 01:03:46,195
Somebody brought something back
from your jump. Something small.

897
01:03:47,196 --> 01:03:48,405
Check in there.

898
01:03:52,785 --> 01:03:54,870
Jenny! Look at this.

899
01:03:56,163 --> 01:03:57,915
We have reason to believe
somebody stepped off the path.

900
01:03:58,082 --> 01:03:58,916
Are you accusing me?

901
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:03,128
We're not accusing you of anything.

902
01:04:03,337 --> 01:04:06,006
Maybe in the excitement something
happened. Maybe you don't remember.

903
01:04:10,094 --> 01:04:13,055
We think something happened
on your hunt that caused all this.

904
01:04:13,264 --> 01:04:15,808
If we can find out what it was,
we might be able to set it straight.

905
01:04:16,016 --> 01:04:17,601
I didn't step off the path.

906
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,316
You think because I was scared I didn't
listen and I stepped off the path.

907
01:04:24,525 --> 01:04:26,485
- Well, I didn't!
- He's telling the truth.

908
01:04:26,694 --> 01:04:28,154
I've been over every inch of
his clothes, there's nothing on them.

909
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,572
What about your friend?

910
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:32,992
I don't know if...
We weren't together the whole time.

911
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,119
- You were separated?
- Just for a few seconds.

912
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,288
We have to find him.
A time wave could come any moment.

913
01:04:37,496 --> 01:04:38,455
Where does he live?

914
01:04:38,664 --> 01:04:41,167
He's not at his apartment.
His wife kicked him out.

915
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:43,460
He stays at his office
at the Division Tower, 23rd floor.

916
01:04:43,569 --> 01:04:44,736
We'll never make it on foot.

917
01:04:44,745 --> 01:04:46,338
There's a parking garage down below.

918
01:04:47,339 --> 01:04:49,550
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Eckles. Let's go.

919
01:04:51,677 --> 01:04:53,387
- You have to.
- I have to what?

920
01:04:53,596 --> 01:04:54,680
Set things right.

921
01:04:54,889 --> 01:04:56,182
We will.

922
01:05:03,355 --> 01:05:06,525
Sonic resonator lock mechanism.
Almost impossible to break.

923
01:05:06,734 --> 01:05:07,776
Any suggestions?

924
01:05:07,985 --> 01:05:10,779
If we had an audio oscillator
I could find the waves and...

925
01:05:18,954 --> 01:05:21,081
How do you think I put myself
through medical school?

926
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,887
We promised those people
we'd get them food.

927
01:05:35,095 --> 01:05:37,389
In an hour we'll have the time line
fixed and they won't need it.

928
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,141
- What if we don't get it fixed?
- Then they'll be the food.

929
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:40,517
Look out!

930
01:05:42,311 --> 01:05:43,354
What the hell was that?

931
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:53,697
Sonia, come with me.

932
01:05:53,906 --> 01:05:55,950
You two stay to protect the car.

933
01:05:57,243 --> 01:05:58,577
Thanks.

934
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,926
Brambles.

935
01:06:14,218 --> 01:06:15,261
Be careful.

936
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,867
What the hell happened here?

937
01:06:38,075 --> 01:06:38,951
Look at this.

938
01:06:41,036 --> 01:06:42,371
Jesus!

939
01:06:44,206 --> 01:06:47,334
It's the brambles. These people
went crazy and killed each other.

940
01:07:01,432 --> 01:07:02,892
Mr. Middleton?

941
01:07:13,194 --> 01:07:15,029
Get out of here!
There's no food in here!

942
01:07:15,237 --> 01:07:16,155
Mr. Middleton!

943
01:07:16,363 --> 01:07:19,992
It's Travis Ryer from Time Safari.
We just want to talk to you.

944
01:07:22,203 --> 01:07:24,205
Mr. Middleton, we're gonna come in.

945
01:07:33,422 --> 01:07:35,424
Mr. Middleton, we just want to talk.

946
01:07:35,925 --> 01:07:37,593
Okay? We're gonna come in.

947
01:07:40,805 --> 01:07:42,431
What do you want? Who is she?

948
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,517
Be careful, he's infected.

949
01:07:44,683 --> 01:07:47,019
No whispering!
You think I can't hear you?

950
01:07:47,228 --> 01:07:49,772
She's with the company. We just want
to look at your outfit from the jump.

951
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:50,898
Why?

952
01:07:51,106 --> 01:07:53,234
Someone may have inadvertently
brought something back.

953
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,237
Who told you that?
Eckles, that little weasel?

954
01:07:56,779 --> 01:07:58,739
He hates me! He's lying!

955
01:07:58,948 --> 01:08:00,991
Not your fault.
You're not in trouble.

956
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,034
Damn right, I'm not!

957
01:08:02,618 --> 01:08:03,911
Where are you?

958
01:08:04,286 --> 01:08:06,831
How dare you come here and accuse me?

959
01:08:10,876 --> 01:08:13,963
That piece of crap safari!
I haven't felt right since!

960
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:34,900
Don't you run away
when I'm talking to you!

961
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:41,448
Drop the gun!
I don't want to shoot you.

962
01:08:41,657 --> 01:08:42,825
Why not? I want to shoot you.

963
01:08:43,033 --> 01:08:44,827
Listen to me, we can fix this.

964
01:08:45,035 --> 01:08:46,078
No, you can't.

965
01:08:46,287 --> 01:08:47,746
Nobody can.

966
01:08:55,796 --> 01:08:58,757
Tell me I wasn't lying.
Tell me we can fix this.

967
01:09:01,093 --> 01:09:03,137
Family albums, nice.

968
01:09:04,555 --> 01:09:05,764
Here we go!

969
01:09:12,271 --> 01:09:13,230
I don't believe it.

970
01:09:15,649 --> 01:09:16,984
A single butterfly.

971
01:09:17,193 --> 01:09:18,235
Isn't that amazing?

972
01:09:18,777 --> 01:09:19,695
Yes, it is.

973
01:09:24,033 --> 01:09:24,992
What the hell are you shooting at?

974
01:09:25,201 --> 01:09:28,162
Those birds, if that's what they are.
Did you find it?

975
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:30,581
Middleton stepped off the path.
He killed a butterfly.

976
01:09:39,632 --> 01:09:42,593
- A butterfly caused all this?
- Is that so hard to believe?

977
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,262
- It's a bug!
- It's an insect that laid eggs.

978
01:09:45,471 --> 01:09:49,099
The point is, Jenny, it wasn't a bug
that was stepped on, it was evolution.

979
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:25,636
Watch it!

980
01:10:40,442 --> 01:10:41,944
The wave's coming!

981
01:10:45,489 --> 01:10:46,699
Hang on!

982
01:11:43,964 --> 01:11:45,800
This can't be good.

983
01:11:49,428 --> 01:11:50,304
Travis?

984
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,725
It's Hatton.

985
01:11:54,934 --> 01:11:58,479
I got a feeling there's only one wave
left, then it's our turn to be altered.

986
01:11:58,687 --> 01:12:00,773
This isn't gonna be easy to do
with flippers instead of arms, is it?

987
01:12:01,524 --> 01:12:04,360
If this place is wrecked,
then we won't be able to send you back.

988
01:12:05,027 --> 01:12:07,947
Then we have to find a way to make
another place work. Is it possible?

989
01:12:08,405 --> 01:12:09,657
Let me think.

990
01:12:10,407 --> 01:12:11,492
Maybe.

991
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:14,328
Let's take a look around
and see what we can salvage here.

992
01:12:14,537 --> 01:12:18,415
Okay, with TAMI's hard drive,
all we need is another portal.

993
01:12:18,624 --> 01:12:21,001
- Let's go to Home Depot.
- There's one at the University.

994
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:23,587
- A Home Depot?
- No, a portal.

995
01:12:23,796 --> 01:12:26,423
Well, not exactly a portal,
a particle accelerator.

996
01:12:26,841 --> 01:12:30,219
With the right software it becomes
a portal. TAMI's hard drive is.

997
01:12:30,427 --> 01:12:32,471
- Are we talking "plug and play"?
- Yeah, more or less.

998
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,307
- Which one is it? More or less?
- More, I hope.

999
01:12:35,516 --> 01:12:38,060
Get the jumpsuit,
I'll try and make this work.

1000
01:12:38,894 --> 01:12:41,981
The University is two miles away.
Will we travel through the city on foot?

1001
01:12:42,189 --> 01:12:43,691
Derris! What are you doing in here?

1002
01:12:45,401 --> 01:12:46,777
Please be quiet.

1003
01:12:46,986 --> 01:12:47,778
What are you talking about?

1004
01:12:49,947 --> 01:12:51,991
- You'll wake them up.
- Wake who?

1005
01:13:06,464 --> 01:13:07,298
My God.

1006
01:13:21,979 --> 01:13:24,148
We still have a chance,
but we have to go now.

1007
01:13:24,356 --> 01:13:26,108
Come on. We're getting out of here.

1008
01:13:26,567 --> 01:13:29,570
There's still time,
but we've got to hurry.

1009
01:13:46,837 --> 01:13:48,380
Suit yourself.

1010
01:13:54,136 --> 01:13:55,179
Wait.

1011
01:13:58,349 --> 01:14:00,184
You can't leave me here.

1012
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,895
Wait for me.

1013
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:25,292
We can go underground
using the subway tracks.

1014
01:14:29,547 --> 01:14:30,881
What's that smell?

1015
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:33,050
- Rotten eggs?
- Sulfur.

1016
01:14:35,594 --> 01:14:37,680
- It's a swamp.
- Let's go back up.

1017
01:14:37,888 --> 01:14:38,973
No, this is the only way.

1018
01:14:39,181 --> 01:14:42,101
You're crazy, I'm not going in there.
I say we go back up and run for it.

1019
01:14:42,309 --> 01:14:43,894
God knows what's under there.

1020
01:14:47,356 --> 01:14:48,357
Come on.

1021
01:15:14,717 --> 01:15:17,720
- We almost there?
- We passed two stations already.

1022
01:15:17,928 --> 01:15:20,389
It can't be more
than a couple a hundred yards up ahead.

1023
01:15:25,561 --> 01:15:26,479
Wait a second.

1024
01:15:30,441 --> 01:15:31,942
Turn off your lights.

1025
01:15:34,487 --> 01:15:36,071
Don't make a sound.

1026
01:15:50,461 --> 01:15:51,962
It's okay, come on up!

1027
01:16:11,857 --> 01:16:13,567
At least it's dry in here.

1028
01:16:16,403 --> 01:16:18,447
Let's see if it's collapsed up ahead.

1029
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:26,413
If it's clear,
maybe we can get through.

1030
01:16:32,628 --> 01:16:33,629
Let's keep moving.

1031
01:16:49,645 --> 01:16:52,189
The door's blocked, we gotta go back.

1032
01:17:16,005 --> 01:17:16,839
Jesus.

1033
01:17:17,047 --> 01:17:19,633
This thing
isn't gonna stay watertight forever.

1034
01:17:36,817 --> 01:17:38,652
There's gotta be
access vents in the tunnel,

1035
01:17:38,861 --> 01:17:40,279
some way to get to the street.

1036
01:17:40,446 --> 01:17:42,239
- How do we find out?
- We gotta bust a window and swim up.

1037
01:17:42,448 --> 01:17:43,991
What if there's no vent there?

1038
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,076
Then we drown.
But, either way, we can't stay here.

1039
01:17:46,452 --> 01:17:48,162
I'll shoot out a window.

1040
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:50,372
It should take about 30 seconds
for this thing to fill up.

1041
01:17:50,581 --> 01:17:51,916
Stay close to me,

1042
01:17:52,082 --> 01:17:54,919
take the deepest breath of your life,
then we'll go for it.

1043
01:17:55,085 --> 01:17:56,712
Okay. Just...

1044
01:17:58,881 --> 01:17:59,840
Give me a second, okay?

1045
01:18:10,309 --> 01:18:11,435
Come on!

1046
01:18:12,394 --> 01:18:13,521
Hold on to me!

1047
01:18:14,522 --> 01:18:16,398
I got you! Let's go!

1048
01:18:16,774 --> 01:18:17,691
Hold on to me!

1049
01:18:22,571 --> 01:18:24,281
Take a breath and go under!

1050
01:18:24,865 --> 01:18:25,908
Here we go!

1051
01:18:27,159 --> 01:18:27,952
Let's go!

1052
01:20:01,253 --> 01:20:04,298
Travis?
Travis, stay with me!

1053
01:20:18,646 --> 01:20:19,438
Come on.

1054
01:20:20,356 --> 01:20:22,316
There's an access way down here.

1055
01:20:51,637 --> 01:20:55,266
- Those animals are pretty evolved.
- The next wave is us.

1056
01:21:32,595 --> 01:21:35,306
Start praying
that the backup generators work.

1057
01:21:43,314 --> 01:21:44,523
Oh, yes.

1058
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,573
Not good.

1059
01:21:59,788 --> 01:22:01,832
Almost there, get ready.

1060
01:22:12,009 --> 01:22:14,762
Remember, even if this works
it'll be highly unstable.

1061
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:16,347
You'll have about 20 seconds.

1062
01:22:19,475 --> 01:22:21,936
<i>Hello, Dr. Rand.
Where exactly are we?</i>

1063
01:22:22,144 --> 01:22:23,145
We're at the University.

1064
01:22:23,354 --> 01:22:25,940
<i>In the public sector now?
Not a good sign.</i>

1065
01:22:26,148 --> 01:22:28,567
We're going to attempt
a slingshot jump. What do you think?

1066
01:22:28,776 --> 01:22:30,736
<i>It's theoretical.
It's never been attempted.</i>

1067
01:22:30,945 --> 01:22:32,279
There's a first time for everything.

1068
01:22:45,459 --> 01:22:46,502
It's gonna hurt.

1069
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:50,047
You'll be back a year before the hunt
for about half a nanosecond,

1070
01:22:50,256 --> 01:22:52,216
then you'll be thrown
forward again to the hunt.

1071
01:22:52,424 --> 01:22:54,176
- Now would be a good time.
- I'm working on it!

1072
01:22:57,763 --> 01:22:59,306
I've gotta find a way to get proof.

1073
01:23:00,266 --> 01:23:02,143
If this works,
everything goes back to normal.

1074
01:23:02,351 --> 01:23:04,186
You don't remember anything
and I don't remember anything.

1075
01:23:08,023 --> 01:23:10,067
I gotta get proof
that something went wrong,

1076
01:23:10,276 --> 01:23:11,986
otherwise
we wouldn't have made a difference.

1077
01:23:13,362 --> 01:23:15,781
We've gotta make sure
that this never happens again!

1078
01:23:18,450 --> 01:23:19,952
I'll find a way.

1079
01:23:29,503 --> 01:23:30,838
The wave, it's here!
It's coming!

1080
01:23:33,424 --> 01:23:34,758
Hit a button! Any button!

1081
01:23:42,141 --> 01:23:43,225
I'll find a way!

1082
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:44,078
Over here, big guy!

1083
01:24:47,706 --> 01:24:49,500
Come on, over this way!

1084
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:50,834
Jenny!

1085
01:24:54,171 --> 01:24:56,257
- Jenny!
- Payne, where the hell is that gun?

1086
01:24:56,465 --> 01:24:58,050
You have to get me on the holo-disc!

1087
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,511
Hatton and Derris turned
the bio-filter off

1088
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:02,805
and something went very wrong!

1089
01:25:03,013 --> 01:25:04,014
When you get back,

1090
01:25:04,223 --> 01:25:07,434
make sure you check the filter
and give the disc to me!

1091
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:11,147
Only me!

1092
01:25:43,095 --> 01:25:45,723
Don't you ever pull
a stunt like that again!

1093
01:25:45,931 --> 01:25:48,976
If anyone's gonna die saving someone's
rich, fat ass, it's gonna be me, got it?

1094
01:25:49,268 --> 01:25:50,186
Yeah.

1095
01:25:50,561 --> 01:25:51,687
Where are the clients?

1096
01:25:57,568 --> 01:25:59,069
Why are you looking at me like that?

1097
01:26:02,448 --> 01:26:04,408
- You sure he's dead?
- You want to check his pulse?

1098
01:26:04,867 --> 01:26:06,160
Anyone hurt?

1099
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:08,621
- They're fine.
- What happened back there?

1100
01:26:08,829 --> 01:26:09,788
Don't you know?

1101
01:26:09,997 --> 01:26:11,916
He fell
right where he was supposed to.

1102
01:26:12,374 --> 01:26:13,417
You got lucky.

1103
01:26:14,293 --> 01:26:17,630
Did anyone break any protocols?
Then we're fine.

1104
01:26:17,838 --> 01:26:19,089
Travis, the volcano...

1105
01:26:19,298 --> 01:26:20,591
We better get going.

1106
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:21,884
Follow me.

1107
01:26:25,805 --> 01:26:27,765
Clay, by the way, I know.

1108
01:26:28,682 --> 01:26:31,644
When we get back, the bio-filter...

1109
01:26:31,852 --> 01:26:33,646
turn it back on, okay?

1110
01:26:33,854 --> 01:26:34,772
Good boy.

1111
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:10,516
Welcome! Gentlemen!

1112
01:27:11,308 --> 01:27:12,226
And well done!

1113
01:27:12,434 --> 01:27:15,813
We promised you
the experience of a lifetime

1114
01:27:16,021 --> 01:27:17,106
and we delivered.

1115
01:27:17,356 --> 01:27:20,818
As long as you know,
everything was according to plan.

1116
01:27:21,026 --> 01:27:22,153
What the hell happened?

1117
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:25,281
Equipment malfunction.
We're okay, but it was close.

1118
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:32,121
- Clay, what went...
- We have a problem.

1119
01:27:40,379 --> 01:27:41,714
I have to talk to you.

1120
01:27:41,881 --> 01:27:43,090
What's wrong?

1121
01:27:44,049 --> 01:27:46,177
You've gotta take a look at this.

1122
01:27:46,385 --> 01:27:49,430
I told Hatton
the recorder malfunctioned.

1123
01:27:49,638 --> 01:27:50,723
Don't let anyone see it.

1124
01:27:50,931 --> 01:27:52,183
Why? What's on here?

1125
01:27:52,391 --> 01:27:55,728
I don't know how to say this
without sounding nuttier than usual.

1126
01:27:56,187 --> 01:27:57,104
You.

1127
01:27:57,313 --> 01:27:59,565
- Of course I'm on it...
- No!

1128
01:27:59,773 --> 01:28:01,358
It was another you...

1129
01:28:02,234 --> 01:28:03,944
Actually, very much the same you.

1130
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:10,534
Just take it and get outta here.

1131
01:28:10,743 --> 01:28:12,161
You'll understand.

1132
01:28:49,281 --> 01:28:52,368
You come for another argument?
I'm kind of tired. Come back tomorrow.

1133
01:28:52,576 --> 01:28:54,620
I need to speak to you.

1134
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:55,830
Hatton send you?

1135
01:28:56,038 --> 01:28:59,583
If he knew what I had, he'd do
anything to stop me from seeing you.

1136
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:07,883
Make yourself useful.
There's a bag of fertilizer,

1137
01:29:08,092 --> 01:29:10,761
- put it on the rhododendron.
- The white ones.

1138
01:29:11,762 --> 01:29:14,348
You know, I'm a gardener myself.
I've got a fern.

1139
01:29:14,557 --> 01:29:15,808
So, what do you want?

1140
01:29:16,016 --> 01:29:18,060
I want to put myself out of a job.

1141
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,982
- I have a disc for you.
- I don't have time to watch discs.

1142
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:26,318
Take a look at this one. Seen it
twice myself and it's got everything:

1143
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:29,738
Action, disaster, government corruption.
It's the proof you need.

1144
01:29:29,947 --> 01:29:33,868
Everything you've been warning us about
has already happened and it's all here.

1145
01:29:36,453 --> 01:29:38,914
Why don't you stop
being such a pain-in-the-ass

1146
01:29:39,123 --> 01:29:40,708
and take a look at this?

1147
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:43,502
Who gave that to you?

1148
01:29:44,086 --> 01:29:45,212
I did.

1149
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:55,556
So, do you want

1150
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:57,808
a cup of coffee?
