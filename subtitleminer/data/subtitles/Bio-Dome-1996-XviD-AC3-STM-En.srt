Over the last few years...

2
00:02:48,176 --> 00:02:51,634
mankind has been witness
to a continual parade...

3
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,308
of environmental disasters...

4
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:57,648
leaving many searching
for a ray of hope...

5
00:02:57,686 --> 00:03:00,678
in an already bleak landscape.

6
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:06,253
This is it. lsn't it?

7
00:03:06,294 --> 00:03:08,091
Geez, look at this.

8
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:10,097
Look at this! And it's mine.

9
00:03:10,131 --> 00:03:12,099
The place is the Arizona desert.

10
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:14,363
Here, a team of scientists
and investors...

11
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,098
led by Dr. Noah Faulkner,
has come together...

12
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:19,606
to create the first
space station on Earth--

13
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:22,542
a self-contained world,
a pure environment...

14
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,602
unspoiled, unpolluted...

15
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:27,114
a world that
no longer exists outside.

16
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:30,379
This Earth Day, Dr. Faulkner
and four carefully chosen...

17
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,444
highly qualified scientists
will seal themselves inside.

18
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:36,457
Their mission will be
to sustain life for one year...

19
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:39,392
while living in harmony
with nature.

20
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,021
Welcome to Bio-Dome.

21
00:03:42,063 --> 00:03:44,759
Congratulations, Bio-Dome Five,
and good luck.

22
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,460
On your steady shoulders...

23
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:49,698
rests the hopes and dreams
of a scientific community--

24
00:03:49,738 --> 00:03:53,139
perhaps the very survival
of the human race.

25
00:03:56,144 --> 00:03:57,441
OK, ready?

26
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:02,048
Paper covers rock.

27
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,677
You lose, Buckwheat.

28
00:04:06,354 --> 00:04:09,050
Sorry, you have
to assume the position...

29
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,117
because l'm king
and you're the peasant.

30
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:15,719
l win, you lose!

31
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:17,925
OK, you ready?

32
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,991
Copy that, Squirly Control.

33
00:04:20,034 --> 00:04:21,865
Stubby!

34
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:24,804
Squirly!

35
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,638
Should have been harder.

36
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:40,918
Perfect!

37
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,527
Hi, Mo-Mo, Porky!

38
00:04:48,563 --> 00:04:50,622
Thanks for coming over!

39
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,225
Hey, Budley.

40
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:01,867
You guys ready to go?

41
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,400
See, that's the thing.

42
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:07,643
We're supposed to go with you
to this Earth Day thing.

43
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,671
Yeah.

44
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:10,274
Don't mimic me.

45
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:11,751
Easy, Squirly.

46
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:14,311
Listen, we can't go.

47
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,789
-Doyle had a bad accident.
-What?

48
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:18,258
Come here. l'll show you.

49
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:20,591
Look at his wrist.
lt's quivering.

50
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:22,596
Oh, my God! What happened?

51
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,599
l'm no doctor,
but l think he's brain-dead.

52
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:26,759
Yeah, and?

53
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:29,895
ln tribute to Earth Day...

54
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:33,965
Doyle was on the couch trying
to take down the mahi-mahi...

55
00:05:34,008 --> 00:05:36,602
and set it free!

56
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:39,511
Free Mahi-mahi...

57
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,606
if you will, and then kaboom !

58
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:43,617
Gravity snatched
the poor little boy...

59
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:45,619
and he fell down
like a rag doll.

60
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:49,612
ls this one of your
convenient little accidents?

61
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:50,817
Monique, look.

62
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:53,794
You call a huge welt
on the guy's head an accident?

63
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:55,159
l can't make that up.

64
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,631
Please let me out, Mommy...

65
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,794
or at least slide
another pancake under the door.

66
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:05,636
My poor Doyley.
l'll nurse you.

67
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:07,072
OK, let's play nurse.

68
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:08,803
l smell a scam.

69
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:12,074
No, that's Doyley.
He's got a quivery colon.

70
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:13,239
That's cute.

71
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,875
You promised to help us
pick up trash today.

72
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,750
That's what
Earth Day's all about--

73
00:06:18,786 --> 00:06:20,447
saving the environment.

74
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:22,581
Girls,
you're thinking too globally.

75
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:24,353
You have to act locally.

76
00:06:24,392 --> 00:06:27,190
We need to stay here
and help Doyle merge...

77
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:29,059
on the road to recovery.

78
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,589
All right, Bud.
You win again.

79
00:06:32,634 --> 00:06:35,102
Win? This isn't a contest.

80
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:37,104
lt's not a game here.

81
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:39,663
Give me a kiss.

82
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:41,675
What do you think?

83
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,609
lt's not my fault
his brain cramped.

84
00:06:43,645 --> 00:06:45,510
You little dick!

85
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:48,038
Brain cramp, my butt!

86
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:50,880
The only thing that hit
Doyle's head is this book!

87
00:06:53,555 --> 00:06:57,218
You cracked Doyle's skull
to get out of this?

88
00:06:57,258 --> 00:06:59,385
The book fell on him !

89
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:02,396
He fell on the book!
They collided!

90
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,729
Bullshit! lt's just like you
to weasel out...

91
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:07,735
of your responsibilities
on Earth Day.

92
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:10,932
This is Hands Across America
all over again.

93
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,269
l had arthritis.

94
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,501
Farm Aid?

95
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,008
l had fleas.

96
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:16,374
The Save-the-Whales rally?

97
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:18,276
Salt water makes Doyle bloat.

98
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,746
You guys are pathetic.

99
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:21,772
Thanks for coming, Mo!

100
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,844
Face it.
We're dating primates.

101
00:07:26,888 --> 00:07:28,219
They're getting better.

102
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:29,951
They're taking yoga.

103
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,583
And you're the one
that keeps on raving...

104
00:07:31,626 --> 00:07:33,594
about how flexible
Bud is getting.

105
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:35,596
There is something
about a man...

106
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,564
who can lick his own back.

107
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,294
We just have to be patient.

108
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,926
Freeing the mahi-mahi?

109
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:44,132
What kind of mind
thinks up crap like that?

110
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,106
They should be taught a lesson.

111
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,404
They should be punished.

112
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:52,429
This is Uncle Fred...

113
00:07:52,463 --> 00:07:54,590
from the Carolina
School of Bartending.

114
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:57,624
What are you doing?
Grab it. Eat it.

115
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:03,563
The one with the corn.

116
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,544
You like it.

117
00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:16,075
Good one.

118
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:19,723
Johnson's residence.

119
00:08:19,757 --> 00:08:21,554
Bud Macintosh here.
That's my name.

120
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:23,560
Ask me once.
l'll say the same.

121
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:24,652
Hey, Budweezer.

122
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:26,561
lt's the girls.

123
00:08:26,597 --> 00:08:30,465
Hey, Mo-Mo.
How's sanitation detail going?

124
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,799
lt's great,
but we're going to split.

125
00:08:32,837 --> 00:08:34,395
We met these guys
from Arizona Tech...

126
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:37,067
and they're taking us
to a kegger at Vasquez Lake.

127
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:41,442
What? You met men?
Of the male persuasion?

128
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,312
They're on the swim team.

129
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:45,577
Please hold.

130
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:48,084
What's going on? What?

131
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:51,088
Monique, Doyle and l
just talked it over...

132
00:08:51,122 --> 00:08:53,090
and we decided
you cannot go...

133
00:08:53,124 --> 00:08:55,592
to that kegger party
at Vasquez Lakes...

134
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,093
with the swimmers.

135
00:08:57,128 --> 00:08:58,755
What are you talking about?

136
00:08:58,796 --> 00:09:00,764
Hold on, guys. We're coming.

137
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:02,629
Whatever, Bud.

138
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:08,065
Our girls have been seduced
by breaststrokers.

139
00:09:09,474 --> 00:09:10,907
They bought it!

140
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:14,543
Swimmers.

141
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:17,844
Do you have any idea
how many diseases are in pools?

142
00:09:17,882 --> 00:09:19,611
Especially
after we swim in them.

143
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,743
-l know!
-l can't believe this!

144
00:09:21,786 --> 00:09:25,222
Shaved-down pool Nazis
oiling up our women...

145
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:28,555
and swimming with them
in an Olympic-sized toilet.

146
00:09:28,593 --> 00:09:31,084
Ever see the bathing suits
they wear?

147
00:09:34,098 --> 00:09:36,259
Grape smugglers.

148
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:41,663
Can you believe those girls?

149
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,506
lt's not like we're not into
saving the environment.

150
00:09:46,944 --> 00:09:49,071
All's l know is...

151
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:51,638
l won't lose my beloved
to some steroid-friendly...

152
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:54,742
web-footed,
porpoise-prissy punk!

153
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:57,220
Don't worry about it though,
because l think...

154
00:09:57,255 --> 00:09:59,120
when they see
we've gotten off the couch...

155
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:00,488
they'll go into seizures.

156
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:03,119
-You think?
-Total.

157
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:06,687
Check out that mall, man.

158
00:10:08,132 --> 00:10:10,157
Must be the grand opening.

159
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:12,761
''Bio-Dome.''

160
00:10:12,804 --> 00:10:14,965
Think that means
it goes both ways?

161
00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:17,031
l don't know, but we do.

162
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:29,609
l don't think there's a kegger
at Vasquez Lakes.

163
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:31,212
We've been had, Squirly.

164
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:34,782
Makes you kind of proud that
we got such crafty girlfriends.

165
00:10:34,826 --> 00:10:36,259
We're lucky guys.

166
00:10:36,294 --> 00:10:38,319
That's for sure.

167
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:41,131
Vasquez Lake?

168
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:43,156
More like Vasquez crap hole.

169
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:44,793
There used to be fish here,
remember?

170
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:46,201
Yes, l do, Doyle.

171
00:10:46,237 --> 00:10:48,762
A long time ago,
when we were kids.

172
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:51,104
Leave Bud alone, Mom !

173
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:54,634
l'm teaching Bud how
to hold his breath underwater.

174
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,146
Much better, Bud.

175
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,148
Let's try for three minutes.

176
00:10:58,182 --> 00:10:59,774
Those were the days.

177
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:01,284
Yeah, l'll say.

178
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:06,113
Don't leave that there, Stub.

179
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,619
Free refills
with proof-of-purchase seal.

180
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:14,290
Nice call.

181
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:16,630
-Tribal!
-Tribal!

182
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:28,244
l got to take a piss.

183
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,179
-Can you cork it?
-Negatory.

184
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:31,738
Let's go at the mall
right there.

185
00:11:31,782 --> 00:11:34,114
Welcome to Bio-Dome!

186
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,619
Welcome to the future!

187
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:39,145
Welcome to the place
l'm going to drain my lizard.

188
00:11:40,558 --> 00:11:43,823
Viva Los Bio-Dome

189
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:48,594
Viva Los Bio-Dome

190
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:53,137
After all
our careful planning...

191
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:59,007
the many years of meticulous
research and experimentation...

192
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:03,810
our dream is finally at hand.

193
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:06,643
Thank you.

194
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,517
Viva Los Bio-Dome

195
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:14,116
Viva Los Bio-Dome

196
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:18,789
Rip Van Tinkle-fest.

197
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:22,094
Dr. Noah Faulkner.

198
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:26,603
Thank you. Thank you.

199
00:12:26,637 --> 00:12:30,198
We stand today
at the bridge to a future...

200
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:34,109
where man and the ecosystem
can live in harmony...

201
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:35,874
and make it possible for us...

202
00:12:35,913 --> 00:12:39,110
not only to balance
our own fragile planet...

203
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:44,178
but one day to sustain life
on new worlds far, far away.

204
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,555
You have entrusted us
with an awesome responsibility.

205
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:50,026
Swift, swift, swift.

206
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,892
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

207
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:53,726
How can l help you fellas?

208
00:12:53,764 --> 00:12:56,164
Can my friend go inside
and pee in your mall?

209
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,169
lt didn't occur to him
to do it at the lake.

210
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:00,830
Back off, punks.

211
00:13:00,871 --> 00:13:02,236
Sir, yes, sir!

212
00:13:02,273 --> 00:13:04,264
Loosen up, bacon boy.

213
00:13:04,308 --> 00:13:05,570
Just want to go inside
and take a pee...

214
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,077
and then we got to go.

215
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:08,544
What up with that, G?

216
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,240
You girls want to get physical?

217
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:16,609
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

218
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:21,421
-Exhale, Stubbs.
-l kill you.

219
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:24,587
Whoa, a little demonite.

220
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:27,598
Look, exhale, Stubbs.
Just chill.

221
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:30,192
Go, go!
Sorry about this.

222
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:33,567
Please, l would like
to introduce my team.

223
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,471
Ms. Olivia Biggs,
our geologist.

224
00:13:38,142 --> 00:13:41,600
Mr. T.C. Romulus,
our entomologist.

225
00:13:41,646 --> 00:13:44,615
Ms. Petra Von Kant,
our oceanographer...

226
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:49,211
and Ms. Mimi Simkins,
our agriculturalist.

227
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:50,948
l can't do it here.

228
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:52,615
Tiny Elvis has stage fright.

229
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:54,625
Just think of the water.

230
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:57,025
Just let it go. Hurry.

231
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:58,619
l can't do it here.

232
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:01,564
ln the hopes of bettering
our environment...

233
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:05,385
Come on.
Give me your smoke.

234
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,884
With the cutting
of this ribbon...

235
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,151
a new era in science
and technology begins.

236
00:14:11,158 --> 00:14:12,523
What are you doing?

237
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,753
Watch.

238
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,600
Over there,
by that grassy knoll!

239
00:14:22,636 --> 00:14:24,297
Assassins! Assassins!

240
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:27,307
-l can't get up!
-Holy Kennedy!

241
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:33,704
Section 2, code 3. 10-4.

242
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:39,919
What kind of mall is this?

243
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:43,081
There's no stores or food courts
or toiletries.

244
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:46,786
There's got to be a toiletry
here somewhere.

245
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,655
Now, look at all
the vegetation...

246
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,190
for your fertilization.

247
00:14:55,235 --> 00:15:00,195
lt seems someone was
a little eager to celebrate.

248
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,641
God bless you.
l know how you feel.

249
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:07,272
l've been waiting
for this moment a long time.

250
00:15:07,314 --> 00:15:09,407
Give me the scissors.

251
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,054
Warning. Warning. Warning.

252
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:25,724
Toxins being introduced
in the rain forest.

253
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:29,634
Homeostasis is at 99.1 percent.

254
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,077
Here we go.

255
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:40,079
See you in a year.

256
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:41,603
Good luck.

257
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:51,551
-You OK?
-Pulled a nad.

258
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:53,752
Let's get out of
this Jurassic mall...

259
00:15:53,794 --> 00:15:55,352
find our girls...

260
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:57,693
and take care of what
we need to take care of.

261
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:09,133
Hey! Look! Look!

262
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:14,007
-Get them out of there!
-Oh, my God.

263
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:19,644
Doyle, l don't think
this is a mall.

264
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:21,381
Get them out of there!

265
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,956
You've got to be kidding me.

266
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:28,585
My bug!

267
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,765
Son of a bitch.

268
00:16:36,803 --> 00:16:38,293
Here we go.

269
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:42,642
Mr. Leaky, has there been
a security breach?

270
00:16:42,676 --> 00:16:44,075
Who are these men?

271
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:46,409
Has the Bio-Dome
been contaminated?

272
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:49,582
No, no.

273
00:16:49,616 --> 00:16:53,074
Ladies and gentlemen,
surprise, surprise.

274
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,578
We are pleased
to announce the arrival...

275
00:16:56,623 --> 00:16:59,558
of our two
special scientists.

276
00:16:59,593 --> 00:17:01,094
Beam me up, Stubby.

277
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:03,289
-Jim, he's a Vulcan!
-This way.

278
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,527
This preplanned addition
to Team Bio-Dome...

279
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:10,525
is intended to simulate
the Chaos Theory...

280
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,164
as we encounter it in nature.

281
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:16,539
We'll have plenty more
information on this...

282
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:19,067
a little later on,
and l'll get back to you...

283
00:17:19,112 --> 00:17:23,549
but as you see,
right now we have work to do.

284
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,073
Work to do.

285
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:33,047
Who could be stupid enough...

286
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,585
to think Bio-Dome was a mall?

287
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,064
Bud Macintosh
and Doyle Johnson.

288
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,566
Generation X road kill...

289
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,067
on the superhighway
of progress.

290
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,161
They're not terrorists.
lt's worse.

291
00:17:44,204 --> 00:17:46,069
They're junior college
students from Tucson.

292
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,074
They really thought
it was a mall.

293
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:51,544
Faulkner, get them out now!

294
00:17:51,578 --> 00:17:53,375
The doors are sealed
for one year.

295
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:54,710
l can't open the doors.

296
00:17:54,748 --> 00:17:56,238
lf l open the doors...

297
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,513
the integrity of the
scientific data is compromised.

298
00:17:58,552 --> 00:18:02,147
Everything depends on
the time frame of one year.

299
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:03,656
Screw the time frame!

300
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,624
l have $100 million
invested in this.

301
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:10,289
l don't intend to lose it
because two twits from Tucson...

302
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,164
can't tell a mall toilet
from a damned rain forest!

303
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:19,395
Squirl, break the ice.

304
00:18:24,077 --> 00:18:26,136
Excuse me, miss.
Are you tired?

305
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:28,079
l beg your pardon?

306
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:29,138
Are you tired?

307
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:30,706
No. Why?

308
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,685
Because you've been running
through my mind all day.

309
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:36,779
Excuse me, miss.

310
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:40,552
lf you were yogurt,
would you be...

311
00:18:40,594 --> 00:18:43,529
fruit-at-the-bottom
or stirred?

312
00:18:43,563 --> 00:18:46,532
This is your problem.
Fix it.

313
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:48,431
Then they have to stay.

314
00:18:48,468 --> 00:18:51,767
Our preparation was
for five people, not seven.

315
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:53,170
Adding two more
at this stage...

316
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:55,367
throws the whole system
off balance.

317
00:18:55,408 --> 00:18:58,605
Then the system will adapt.

318
00:19:01,815 --> 00:19:03,009
Did it hurt?

319
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,448
Did what hurt?

320
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:07,044
When you fell from Heaven,
did it hurt?

321
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:11,020
Bud, Doyle, hello!

322
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:13,025
l'm Dr. Noah Faulkner.

323
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:16,517
You may recognize me
from television.

324
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:19,191
You the guy
with the spray-on hair?

325
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:22,690
Anyway, as l'm sure
you already know...

326
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:26,103
you have stumbled
into an exciting new world.

327
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:31,133
Tell me, have you ever
dreamt of being famous?

328
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:32,804
When l was little,
l wanted to be a rock star...

329
00:19:32,846 --> 00:19:34,905
because l could do this
with my finger.

330
00:19:36,116 --> 00:19:38,710
But as l got older,
l realized the reality...

331
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:41,152
of the corporate
rock world sucked.

332
00:19:41,187 --> 00:19:42,711
Besides,
you only knew one song.

333
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:45,190
lronman, lronman

334
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,090
Does whatever an iron can

335
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:49,061
Pancake flat, like a glove--

336
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:50,585
Hold it!

337
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,564
That's Spiderman.

338
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,999
Black Sabbath did lron Man.

339
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:56,400
Oh, come on.

340
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:58,063
What, do you
think you're so smart?

341
00:19:58,104 --> 00:19:59,969
Think you're
some rocket scientist?

342
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:01,439
Yes.

343
00:20:01,474 --> 00:20:03,271
Sorry.

344
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,904
What do you boys want
out of life?

345
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:08,937
To die and come back
as a leotard?

346
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,086
Well, l may be able...

347
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,578
to offer you a springboard
to that future.

348
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:20,457
We would like you
to stay with us.

349
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:22,927
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute, man.

350
00:20:22,962 --> 00:20:26,420
You guys aren't
one of those freaky clans?

351
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:29,594
Dancing naked, you want us
to take off our clothes...

352
00:20:29,636 --> 00:20:31,297
you're going to feed us
weird punch...

353
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:32,600
No.

354
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,097
-Damn.
-Shit. We almost had it.

355
00:20:36,142 --> 00:20:37,632
lt was this close.

356
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:41,280
Boys, this is
where you'll be staying...

357
00:20:41,314 --> 00:20:44,306
and l want you
to feel right at home.

358
00:20:46,653 --> 00:20:49,622
We'd be obliged if we could get
some nice cushy beds.

359
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:51,453
With Magic Fingers?

360
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:52,856
Like the ones at the mall...

361
00:20:52,892 --> 00:20:55,486
that big tourists
lie in for free.

362
00:20:55,528 --> 00:20:58,326
They plop down.
The kids are around.

363
00:20:58,365 --> 00:21:00,629
''Daddy, look at
the little thing!''

364
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,066
And it just rolls--

365
00:21:02,102 --> 00:21:03,899
See? l have a sciatic.

366
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:05,802
Actually,
we have no extra beds.

367
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,535
-A normal mattress?
-Without rollers?

368
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:10,406
Sorry, no.

369
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:11,410
Here, guys.

370
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,344
Petra and l can live
without this stuff.

371
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,711
l know it's not much.

372
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:17,376
Have you ever been with
a Squirl and a Stub?

373
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:24,112
For the pillow.

374
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,422
You lose the pillow.

375
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,950
For the blanket.

376
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:32,624
You lose the blanket.

377
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:34,132
For fun.

378
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:45,103
l can't sleep.

379
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:47,136
l can't sleep either.

380
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,923
Let's go find us some beds.

381
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:26,400
Get out of here!

382
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:42,657
Wake up. Smell the coffee.

383
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:47,553
Good morning
and congratulations, all.

384
00:22:47,595 --> 00:22:49,893
We have survived night one.

385
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:53,094
Congratulations, Doyle!

386
00:22:54,302 --> 00:22:56,395
And the best thing is...

387
00:22:56,438 --> 00:22:58,429
homeostasis
was maintained all night.

388
00:23:00,442 --> 00:23:01,932
No!

389
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,172
lt is bad enough
that for the next year...

390
00:23:08,216 --> 00:23:10,912
l must share
my air, food, and water...

391
00:23:10,952 --> 00:23:13,648
with these Neanderthals...

392
00:23:13,688 --> 00:23:17,021
but l will not share
my tools of hygiene.

393
00:23:17,058 --> 00:23:18,320
Relax. lt's sanitized.

394
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,954
l dunked it in Olivia's Scope.

395
00:23:23,031 --> 00:23:25,363
-Simian!
-Dick!

396
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:32,529
You guys wanted us to stay, OK?

397
00:23:32,574 --> 00:23:34,565
Think back.
''Springboard into the future.''

398
00:23:34,609 --> 00:23:37,077
We didn't prepare
for this voyage.

399
00:23:37,112 --> 00:23:39,046
We need clean teeth, too.
All right?

400
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,980
His teeth--look.

401
00:23:41,016 --> 00:23:42,540
You are absolutely right.

402
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:44,882
You should be brought
up to speed.

403
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:46,887
lt is time for a tour.

404
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:49,883
Boys. Boys.

405
00:23:49,924 --> 00:23:51,892
From here, you can see...

406
00:23:51,926 --> 00:23:53,621
all the regions
of the Bio-Dome--

407
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:56,892
the rain forest,
tropical lagoon, farm...

408
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:58,694
and the great desert.

409
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:01,668
Every effort was made
to duplicate them precisely...

410
00:24:01,703 --> 00:24:04,729
and all of this
is your home now.

411
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:10,542
But remember,
the survival of this system...

412
00:24:10,578 --> 00:24:13,513
is dependent upon homeostasis.

413
00:24:13,548 --> 00:24:15,516
That means a balance...

414
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,542
within
an enclosed system itself.

415
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:25,183
Could we get some binoculars?

416
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,521
Let's make a rule.

417
00:24:30,565 --> 00:24:33,033
Everything
that you did at home...

418
00:24:33,068 --> 00:24:35,298
you're forbidden to do here.

419
00:24:35,336 --> 00:24:36,826
Everything?

420
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:39,362
Shave poochie poochie.

421
00:24:39,407 --> 00:24:42,001
Shave poochie poochie.

422
00:24:48,683 --> 00:24:50,548
Everything.

423
00:24:50,585 --> 00:24:52,143
-OK.
-All right.

424
00:24:52,187 --> 00:24:56,055
Don't move.
l'll be right back.

425
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:57,718
But l got a wicked itch
on my nads.

426
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,522
Don't move.

427
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:09,833
l got a wicked itch on my nads.

428
00:25:09,871 --> 00:25:11,532
Faulkner said don't move.

429
00:25:15,043 --> 00:25:17,011
l can't take it anymore!

430
00:25:17,045 --> 00:25:19,013
l can't take it!

431
00:25:19,047 --> 00:25:22,505
l guess this means
we're our own tour guides.

432
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,017
All right, everybody...

433
00:25:24,052 --> 00:25:27,021
do not feed the animals,
stay together...

434
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:28,522
and no flash photography.

435
00:25:28,556 --> 00:25:31,024
And remember,
here at Bio-Dome...

436
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:34,028
we're dependent on balancing
homos within the system.

437
00:25:34,062 --> 00:25:36,530
Now everybody
stay with the group.

438
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:39,089
Follow me this way.

439
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:42,069
Jerk, you shouldn't
have hit me so hard.

440
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:47,029
Oh, my God, come here.

441
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:49,543
Hey, there's no knob here!

442
00:25:49,577 --> 00:25:52,546
Oh, God, here we go.

443
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,048
Olivia, what's with this door?
lt's not opening.

444
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,846
Of course it won't open.

445
00:25:56,885 --> 00:25:59,046
That door won't open again
for an entire year.

446
00:25:59,087 --> 00:26:01,988
Nothing goes in or out.
Not even air.

447
00:26:02,023 --> 00:26:05,015
lt would take a Sherman tank
to open that door.

448
00:26:07,462 --> 00:26:08,895
So what you're saying is...

449
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,295
You can't get out.

450
00:26:10,331 --> 00:26:12,492
-We're stuck here.
-For 12 months.

451
00:26:12,534 --> 00:26:13,592
That's right.

452
00:26:13,635 --> 00:26:16,160
-12 months?
-52 weeks.

453
00:26:16,204 --> 00:26:17,228
Yes.

454
00:26:17,272 --> 00:26:19,740
385 days?

455
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:21,674
Yes, yes, yes.

456
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:26,772
So what you're really
trying to say is...

457
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:33,017
Stubby, Squirly--tribal!

458
00:26:33,054 --> 00:26:35,522
l'm a Sherman tank.

459
00:26:35,557 --> 00:26:36,785
Sherman tank!

460
00:26:36,824 --> 00:26:38,052
Sherman tank!

461
00:26:43,264 --> 00:26:45,892
Doyle, Doyle, Doyle
of the jungle

462
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:47,299
Friend to you and me

463
00:26:52,373 --> 00:26:54,841
Watch out for that tree.

464
00:26:59,914 --> 00:27:01,438
Where'd you go?

465
00:27:01,482 --> 00:27:03,177
Where did you come from?

466
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:08,544
My mom and the authorities
are still figuring that out...

467
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,320
but hey, do you know
there's a jungle in here?

468
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,917
Yes, l do.

469
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:14,861
Whoever thought of
putting a jungle...

470
00:27:14,896 --> 00:27:17,797
in Arizona
is a petty smart guy.

471
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:22,825
Whoa! Barbarella!

472
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,008
What are you doing,
making smoothies?

473
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:36,414
No.

474
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:39,545
Nature is about miracles, Bud.

475
00:27:39,587 --> 00:27:42,852
A goat is a miracle.

476
00:27:44,726 --> 00:27:46,717
A carrot is a miracle.

477
00:27:48,296 --> 00:27:51,026
And you're a miracle, too,
Petri.

478
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:55,232
What's up, Doc?

479
00:27:57,472 --> 00:27:59,838
Why are you putting that guy
in the rice paddy?

480
00:27:59,874 --> 00:28:01,967
Tilapia are an integral part
of our food supply.

481
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,773
We adopted
a technique from Asia.

482
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:06,177
The fish eat the algae,
then fertilize the rice.

483
00:28:06,214 --> 00:28:11,880
So these tipitilia,
they're going on the rice?

484
00:28:13,554 --> 00:28:15,112
Crapping on the rice.

485
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:18,148
ln crude layman's terms, yes.

486
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:22,121
Does Uncle Ben know about this?

487
00:28:22,163 --> 00:28:24,631
Hey, l know yoga.

488
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,429
Look.

489
00:28:27,802 --> 00:28:29,269
l do it like that.

490
00:28:29,304 --> 00:28:32,330
Sometimes, l can lick
my back, too. Watch.

491
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:33,897
Then l roll over like this.

492
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,435
The tide monitor
needs attention.

493
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:40,777
Really, l can...

494
00:28:40,815 --> 00:28:41,839
Thank you.

495
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:44,283
Wait. Don't go anywhere.

496
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:47,015
l'll show you
some other maneuvers later.

497
00:28:47,055 --> 00:28:50,684
You should see what--
God, my sciatic.

498
00:28:50,725 --> 00:28:52,590
Come quick.
You gotta see this!

499
00:28:52,627 --> 00:28:54,822
Your sciatic?

500
00:28:54,862 --> 00:28:56,022
Bad?

501
00:28:56,064 --> 00:28:57,395
Get it!

502
00:28:58,566 --> 00:29:02,002
You should see
what she did with a carrot.

503
00:29:03,371 --> 00:29:05,635
Russell, there's beer cans
in the trash in the kitchen...

504
00:29:05,673 --> 00:29:07,903
in the trash
in the bathroom...

505
00:29:07,942 --> 00:29:10,069
and in the trash
in the basement.

506
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:11,476
What does that say?

507
00:29:11,512 --> 00:29:12,672
We're out of beer?

508
00:29:12,714 --> 00:29:16,309
Mom, would you please
tell your love slave...

509
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:17,648
that if he's not
part of the solution...

510
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:19,414
he's part of the problem?

511
00:29:19,454 --> 00:29:23,185
The only problem l have
is l've run out of Depends.

512
00:29:23,224 --> 00:29:26,318
There is a bathroom
right around the corner.

513
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:28,488
l cannot
go to the bathroom.

514
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:31,498
l hurt my bladder
Rollerblading.

515
00:29:36,537 --> 00:29:37,834
Hey, look at that.

516
00:29:37,872 --> 00:29:38,839
There's that guy Bob...

517
00:29:38,873 --> 00:29:40,932
who l chased out of here
the other day.

518
00:29:47,048 --> 00:29:49,414
They're on TV!

519
00:29:50,818 --> 00:29:52,445
lt's amazing!
Can you believe it?

520
00:29:52,487 --> 00:29:54,455
This is
Joachim West reporting.

521
00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:58,357
l told you we were into
nurturing Mother Earth.

522
00:29:58,393 --> 00:30:00,020
But you didn't believe us.

523
00:30:00,061 --> 00:30:03,030
Now you guys
are thinking locally...

524
00:30:03,064 --> 00:30:05,726
and we're acting globally.

525
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:07,735
Just get out of there.

526
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:08,861
Can't. We signed up.

527
00:30:08,903 --> 00:30:10,200
We're part of
the few and the proud.

528
00:30:10,238 --> 00:30:11,535
Part of the problem.

529
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:12,698
Come on, you guys.

530
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,987
This is an important
biological experiment.

531
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:17,021
You'll ruin everything.

532
00:30:17,056 --> 00:30:18,182
Maybe you're not aware of it...

533
00:30:18,224 --> 00:30:20,852
but we're a vital part
of the homeosystem.

534
00:30:20,893 --> 00:30:23,885
Don't you think your couch
is having withdrawals?

535
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,090
Are we supposed to wait
a whole year...

536
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:28,498
for you to get out?

537
00:30:28,534 --> 00:30:32,129
Mo-Mo and Porkchop,
there comes a time in life...

538
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:35,538
when we must sacrifice
that is most dear to us...

539
00:30:35,575 --> 00:30:38,373
for the greater good
of saving the world...

540
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:40,709
and now is that time.

541
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:42,543
ls that how you really feel?

542
00:30:42,582 --> 00:30:44,812
No. This is how
l really feel.

543
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,715
Budly, there's people around.

544
00:30:46,752 --> 00:30:48,049
l miss it.

545
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:49,714
l know. l miss you.

546
00:30:49,755 --> 00:30:51,052
l'm proud of you.

547
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,957
So l guess this is good-bye?

548
00:30:53,993 --> 00:30:55,585
l guess.

549
00:31:08,874 --> 00:31:11,707
Attention. Dinner is served.

550
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:15,373
Well, we got to go. Bye.

551
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:17,880
Bye.

552
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,585
Day one, in the books.

553
00:31:31,297 --> 00:31:33,060
Cheers, mate.

554
00:31:44,377 --> 00:31:46,368
What's with this kibble?

555
00:31:46,412 --> 00:31:48,812
Are you guys
trying to poison us?

556
00:31:48,848 --> 00:31:50,577
You don't like soy casserole?

557
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:52,948
Crap tastes like
it came out of Romulus.

558
00:31:52,985 --> 00:31:55,453
Maybe it did.

559
00:31:55,488 --> 00:31:57,888
Soy is our principal
source of protein.

560
00:31:57,923 --> 00:31:59,550
You'll learn to love it.

561
00:31:59,592 --> 00:32:02,117
Could you at least
make it taste like chicken?

562
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:04,925
A little bouillon base,
paprika?

563
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,898
Spice it up a little?

564
00:32:06,932 --> 00:32:09,332
Otherwise, l'll shrivel up
like a supermodel.

565
00:32:09,368 --> 00:32:11,666
l am so fat.

566
00:32:11,704 --> 00:32:13,001
No, you're not.

567
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,633
Nobody likes me.

568
00:32:15,675 --> 00:32:17,006
You're beautiful.

569
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:19,341
People didn't like me
in high school.

570
00:32:19,378 --> 00:32:22,506
-Everybody loves you.
-You're so sweet, Naomi.

571
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:25,711
Avez-vous a cigarette?

572
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:34,720
Squirly, you sleeping?

573
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:44,036
You sleeping?

574
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,039
What did you hit me for?

575
00:32:47,073 --> 00:32:48,404
l can't sleep.

576
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:53,877
Think back at those sleepovers
we used to have.

577
00:32:53,913 --> 00:32:56,006
Maybe then
you'll be able to sleep.

578
00:32:56,048 --> 00:32:57,242
OK.

579
00:33:02,354 --> 00:33:05,881
What's up, Buddy?
l'm the weasel.

580
00:33:05,925 --> 00:33:07,153
OK, my turn.

581
00:33:20,706 --> 00:33:23,004
Peanut butter and jelly
with bacon. That's easy.

582
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,010
Whoa, buddy.
Good call, man.

583
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,013
Keep on cruising.

584
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,880
Keep on going down the line.

585
00:33:33,552 --> 00:33:37,010
Mixed green salad
with blue cheese dressing.

586
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:40,514
Bro, that was fully major, dude.

587
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,527
Your beak always knows, buddy.

588
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:44,859
Keep on cruising.

589
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:47,525
Come on, buddy.
Keep it cruising.

590
00:33:47,566 --> 00:33:49,557
Wait. lt's over here now.

591
00:33:59,578 --> 00:34:01,910
Yo, Mo. Check it out.

592
00:34:01,947 --> 00:34:04,177
Your friends Bob and Darrell
are getting tail.

593
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:10,518
Assholes.

594
00:34:10,556 --> 00:34:12,046
lf l were you...

595
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:15,720
l'd go out and hump
for the next year.

596
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:18,924
lf l were you, Russ,
l'd have my mouth...

597
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:21,023
full of shotgun
with my toe on the trigger.

598
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:24,502
lt's frightening
how much you want me.

599
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,440
Stubby, thriving on chaos!

600
00:34:33,546 --> 00:34:36,037
Those will sell better
than lron Maiden merch.

601
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,350
Let's hope so.

602
00:34:40,386 --> 00:34:42,684
l just want
you gentlemen to remember...

603
00:34:42,721 --> 00:34:46,179
how important you are
to this whole experiment.

604
00:34:46,225 --> 00:34:48,250
Feel free to contribute.

605
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:52,731
You are an integral part
of the Bio-Dome system.

606
00:34:52,765 --> 00:34:54,858
Since you put it that way...

607
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,199
we're thinking of you producing
environmental condoms.

608
00:34:58,237 --> 00:35:01,468
So when you rip the packet...

609
00:35:01,507 --> 00:35:03,304
it's automatic sap lubrication.

610
00:35:03,342 --> 00:35:05,640
No chalk on the bark.

611
00:35:05,678 --> 00:35:08,442
Then, when you're
pollinating your flower...

612
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,142
slide, slide, slippedy-slide.

613
00:35:11,183 --> 00:35:13,651
Just smooth...right in.

614
00:35:13,686 --> 00:35:16,246
Then there's the Bud and Doyle
action figures.

615
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:17,949
Action figures.

616
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,720
Anatomically correct,
of course.

617
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,128
And last but not least...

618
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,659
1-900-SQUlRLY-STUB.

619
00:35:31,704 --> 00:35:33,399
Watch this.

620
00:35:37,877 --> 00:35:40,175
Hi. l'm Doyle.

621
00:35:40,212 --> 00:35:42,009
And l'm Bud.

622
00:35:42,047 --> 00:35:44,675
And when we're not out
saving the environment...

623
00:35:44,717 --> 00:35:46,116
we're thinking of you.

624
00:35:46,151 --> 00:35:50,212
Naked, thigh-deep in tofu.

625
00:35:53,726 --> 00:35:55,591
You likey, Leaky?

626
00:35:57,563 --> 00:36:03,399
Our home is the Garden of Eden.

627
00:36:03,435 --> 00:36:05,630
More like
the Garden of Boredom.

628
00:36:05,671 --> 00:36:07,639
l'm Chairman of the Bored.

629
00:36:07,673 --> 00:36:09,800
We can have our own fun.

630
00:36:09,842 --> 00:36:11,969
Remember when
the Magnavox went out...

631
00:36:12,011 --> 00:36:13,478
when we were kids?

632
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:17,476
Fly, Mary Poppins.

633
00:36:17,516 --> 00:36:21,976
Fly, supercali-fragilistic-
expialidocious.

634
00:36:22,021 --> 00:36:24,148
Can we do it again?

635
00:36:24,189 --> 00:36:25,816
Those were the days.

636
00:36:25,858 --> 00:36:26,984
Cheer up, buckaroo.

637
00:36:27,026 --> 00:36:29,494
Just because
we're stuck in a bubble...

638
00:36:29,528 --> 00:36:31,655
doesn't mean we can't
cause any trouble.

639
00:36:31,697 --> 00:36:33,995
We're the everlasting force...

640
00:36:34,033 --> 00:36:37,833
of Squirly!

641
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,963
Stubby!

642
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:43,668
You ready?

643
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:46,041
Hut one, hut two,
hut, hut, hike!

644
00:36:50,049 --> 00:36:52,313
Let me through.

645
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:53,750
Come on, let me through.

646
00:36:59,224 --> 00:37:00,851
Neon Deion.

647
00:37:00,893 --> 00:37:04,090
No fair! Personal foul!

648
00:37:04,129 --> 00:37:05,460
You want some of me?

649
00:37:05,497 --> 00:37:06,837
You shouldn't have
had some of me.

650
00:37:06,837 --> 00:37:07,565
You shouldn't have
had some of me.

651
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:12,169
Squirly, look!

652
00:37:12,209 --> 00:37:15,440
Fish on the play!

653
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:18,107
My proposal is
that we plant these seeds.

654
00:37:18,149 --> 00:37:21,448
l know you're thinking
''lllegal, illegal''...

655
00:37:21,485 --> 00:37:24,943
but the value
of purple sticky ponge...

656
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:27,958
goes way beyond just toking it.

657
00:37:27,992 --> 00:37:30,961
Ain't that right,
Professor Johnson?

658
00:37:30,995 --> 00:37:33,987
That's correct,
Professor Macintosh.

659
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,128
''Purple sticky ponge,
or hemp...

660
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,468
''is an excellent
source of paper.

661
00:37:41,505 --> 00:37:43,632
''lt makes a fine rope.

662
00:37:43,674 --> 00:37:47,303
''lt can even make
a contaminant-free fuel.

663
00:37:47,344 --> 00:37:50,973
''But the greatest value
to us Bio-Domers...

664
00:37:51,015 --> 00:37:54,974
''is its rapid rate
of photosynensisis...

665
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:59,251
''which means more oxygen
for everyone.''

666
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:02,687
On three.

667
00:38:02,726 --> 00:38:03,920
Three!

668
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:21,139
Cannonball!

669
00:38:24,815 --> 00:38:26,942
There you go, Mr. Bloom.

670
00:38:26,984 --> 00:38:28,281
Thanks, girls.
Now, tell Bud and Doyle...

671
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:30,310
l'm writing a song
about them, OK?

672
00:38:30,354 --> 00:38:31,981
OK, we will.

673
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:35,618
Oh, God.

674
00:38:35,659 --> 00:38:37,024
Check it out.

675
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:39,791
This is the event
you've been waiting for.

676
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,525
lt's the annual
at Arizona Tech.

677
00:38:41,565 --> 00:38:43,965
lt's a three-day blowout
to benefit the rain forest.

678
00:38:44,001 --> 00:38:47,528
There's going to be
seminars and lectures...

679
00:38:47,571 --> 00:38:50,335
and kegs and dudes galore.

680
00:38:50,374 --> 00:38:51,807
We cannot go to this.

681
00:38:51,842 --> 00:38:53,139
Why not, pray tell?

682
00:38:53,177 --> 00:38:55,111
Do Bud and Doyle ring a bell?

683
00:38:55,145 --> 00:38:57,170
A year is a long time
to wait for those guys.

684
00:38:57,214 --> 00:38:58,943
You know how old
we'll be in a year?

685
00:38:58,983 --> 00:39:00,507
Old.

686
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:01,677
Real old.

687
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:04,279
As in not spring chickens,
in over the hill--

688
00:39:04,321 --> 00:39:05,788
OK. OK.

689
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:08,815
Did you see those chicks
they're with?

690
00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:10,383
They're hot.

691
00:39:10,427 --> 00:39:12,895
So? l trust Doyle.

692
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,922
l love Bud just as much
as you love Doyle...

693
00:39:15,966 --> 00:39:17,900
but we got to start thinking
about ourselves.

694
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:19,300
They are.

695
00:39:20,404 --> 00:39:22,964
Oh, OK.

696
00:39:25,976 --> 00:39:28,945
Pay attention, soave-bolla.

697
00:39:28,979 --> 00:39:31,470
You're king. l'm peasant.

698
00:39:36,987 --> 00:39:39,547
Good afternoon, Petri dish.

699
00:39:42,726 --> 00:39:44,250
Perhaps you'd like
to join us...

700
00:39:44,295 --> 00:39:47,128
for a little aperitif
on the ridge?

701
00:39:47,164 --> 00:39:48,961
Allow me to present...

702
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:51,490
Chateau Squirly-Stub.

703
00:39:51,535 --> 00:39:54,299
lt's a bit plucky,
a bit fruity perhaps...

704
00:39:54,338 --> 00:39:56,602
but it'll satisfy your palate...

705
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,699
especially with
a big piece of pork.

706
00:39:58,742 --> 00:40:00,801
So that's what happened
to our fruit harvest.

707
00:40:00,844 --> 00:40:03,506
You're incorrigible.

708
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:07,143
l think they're into us.

709
00:40:07,184 --> 00:40:08,708
ln a huge way. Mini-tribal.

710
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:13,651
Marco!

711
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:15,818
Cholo!

712
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:16,985
Marco!

713
00:40:17,027 --> 00:40:18,494
Cholo!

714
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:21,362
Look. Biodegradable
pineapple.

715
00:40:23,534 --> 00:40:25,058
Olivia, Romuli.

716
00:40:25,102 --> 00:40:27,400
Why don't you guys join us
for a little soak?

717
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:28,837
That's not for bathing.

718
00:40:28,872 --> 00:40:31,340
This is the artificial
rain generator.

719
00:40:34,578 --> 00:40:36,671
lt just got a little warmer.

720
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:39,012
There's nothing artificial
about that.

721
00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:41,882
A little acid rain.

722
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:43,352
They dominate a number
of pivotal processes...

723
00:40:43,387 --> 00:40:44,684
occurring in the soil.

724
00:40:44,722 --> 00:40:47,520
A kind of profound
taking earth.

725
00:40:47,558 --> 00:40:48,889
That's what makes this
so exciting.

726
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:52,722
lt's Bud and Doyle.

727
00:40:52,763 --> 00:40:57,063
Doyle, what's the hot gossip
on the inside?

728
00:40:59,236 --> 00:41:02,137
l really can't make
any comment at this time...

729
00:41:02,172 --> 00:41:05,141
but if l see
one more massive orgy...

730
00:41:05,175 --> 00:41:07,040
l'm moving to Tibet.

731
00:41:07,077 --> 00:41:10,012
And, hey, Faulkner,
quit hogging the K-Y.

732
00:41:11,081 --> 00:41:12,981
Thirty-one...

733
00:41:13,017 --> 00:41:16,316
forty-two...sixty-nine...

734
00:41:16,353 --> 00:41:17,752
seventy-four...

735
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:26,494
A hundred, a thousand!

736
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,498
Here l come!

737
00:41:32,169 --> 00:41:34,603
Rumball, you got to hide me.

738
00:41:34,638 --> 00:41:37,801
Not in here.
You'll upset my bugs.

739
00:41:37,841 --> 00:41:39,069
Look out!

740
00:41:40,878 --> 00:41:42,175
May l help you?

741
00:41:42,212 --> 00:41:44,510
What are these guys?

742
00:41:44,548 --> 00:41:49,281
They're two of the rarest
lepidoptera in the world.

743
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:51,549
Leppard...

744
00:41:51,588 --> 00:41:52,816
Didn't their drummer
lose an arm?

745
00:41:52,856 --> 00:41:56,019
No. They're butterflies...

746
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,891
from the Brazilian
rain forest.

747
00:41:57,928 --> 00:42:00,863
So are you trying to get them
to start porking?

748
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:02,195
Actually, yes.

749
00:42:02,232 --> 00:42:05,258
ln nature, the chances of
these two finding each other...

750
00:42:05,302 --> 00:42:07,270
or porking...

751
00:42:08,405 --> 00:42:10,464
is very remote.

752
00:42:10,507 --> 00:42:13,738
We hope to breed thousands here.

753
00:42:13,777 --> 00:42:15,369
Easy, Rumbo.

754
00:42:15,412 --> 00:42:16,401
Gotcha!

755
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,608
You've got to take me first!

756
00:42:33,864 --> 00:42:36,594
Mothra!
Come back, Mothra!

757
00:42:36,633 --> 00:42:38,328
Please come back, Mothra.

758
00:42:38,368 --> 00:42:41,269
Lepidoptera!

759
00:42:41,305 --> 00:42:44,502
Should we be doing this?

760
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:46,839
We are not
doing anything wrong.

761
00:42:46,877 --> 00:42:49,243
Besides, it's to save
the rain forest.

762
00:42:54,084 --> 00:42:56,348
-Denise.
-Roach.

763
00:42:56,386 --> 00:42:58,877
One word. Raid.

764
00:43:03,827 --> 00:43:04,953
Hey, man.

765
00:43:04,995 --> 00:43:07,122
She thinks she's cool
because she hangs out...

766
00:43:07,164 --> 00:43:09,291
with Bud and Doyle's
girlfriends.

767
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:10,459
Who?

768
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:11,729
She digs me, though.

769
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:14,465
Are those Bio-Dome Bud
and Doyle's girlfriends?

770
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:17,269
Get that bag.

771
00:43:17,307 --> 00:43:19,332
Excuse me.

772
00:43:19,376 --> 00:43:21,344
Are you done with those beers?

773
00:43:21,378 --> 00:43:24,142
Thanks, but we're having
too much fun sober.

774
00:43:24,181 --> 00:43:25,648
That's cool.

775
00:43:25,682 --> 00:43:28,913
We were collecting
empties and recycling them.

776
00:43:28,952 --> 00:43:30,317
Well, take this.

777
00:43:30,354 --> 00:43:32,219
Take mine.

778
00:43:32,256 --> 00:43:34,451
There's a lot of waste
at these parties.

779
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:37,051
That's awfully noble of you.

780
00:43:37,094 --> 00:43:39,494
lt's what we're compelled to do.

781
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,829
We're having a little fete
to save the rain forest.

782
00:43:42,866 --> 00:43:44,595
lf you'd like to come,
show your support...

783
00:43:44,635 --> 00:43:46,330
Will it be like this?

784
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,667
-No.
-Not at all.

785
00:43:47,704 --> 00:43:49,331
lt's going to be decent.

786
00:43:49,373 --> 00:43:50,670
lt's at the quad.

787
00:43:50,707 --> 00:43:52,607
We'll be there.

788
00:43:52,643 --> 00:43:54,008
We'll see you tomorrow.

789
00:43:54,044 --> 00:43:55,534
Thanks.

790
00:43:58,048 --> 00:44:01,017
Noah, it's been
a nonstop moronathon.

791
00:44:01,051 --> 00:44:03,611
l did not dedicate
my life to science...

792
00:44:03,654 --> 00:44:06,122
just to baby-sit
a couple of baboons.

793
00:44:06,156 --> 00:44:08,386
They eat like savages.

794
00:44:08,425 --> 00:44:10,791
At this rate,
we'll run out of foodstuffs.

795
00:44:10,828 --> 00:44:12,819
They're going
to ruin everything.

796
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,114
You sliced it.

797
00:44:17,152 --> 00:44:18,881
Damn it, Billy.

798
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,251
Damn it, damn it!

799
00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:21,586
How am l supposed to hit...

800
00:44:21,623 --> 00:44:25,457
a double birdie
with the shower iron?

801
00:44:25,494 --> 00:44:29,362
You're embarrassing me
in front of my friends.

802
00:44:32,567 --> 00:44:34,057
Come on, Billy.

803
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:39,807
Anatomically correct.

804
00:44:49,051 --> 00:44:51,781
Are you sure this flypaper's
going to work?

805
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,617
l'm positive.
lt's really sticky.

806
00:44:53,655 --> 00:44:56,954
My dad used to use it
to line my playpen.

807
00:44:56,992 --> 00:45:00,428
You must have been
in this position a lot.

808
00:45:00,462 --> 00:45:01,827
Help, Daddy, please.

809
00:45:01,863 --> 00:45:03,888
Get me down.
l wet my Huggies.

810
00:45:03,932 --> 00:45:05,422
Nobody loves me.

811
00:45:07,102 --> 00:45:09,570
Oh, shut up.

812
00:45:09,604 --> 00:45:11,231
CD-ROM, come with us.

813
00:45:11,273 --> 00:45:13,571
We got a big surprise for you.

814
00:45:13,608 --> 00:45:15,075
You've been
diagnosed with Ebola...

815
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,737
and you're about to bleed out?

816
00:45:16,778 --> 00:45:20,908
No. Doyle's got a boner
he wants to put in your ear.

817
00:45:20,949 --> 00:45:24,885
This is
a really big surprise.

818
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,410
lf it's about
Faulkner's third nipple...

819
00:45:26,455 --> 00:45:29,083
don't bother.
l know that.

820
00:45:29,124 --> 00:45:31,752
Faulkner's got three nipples?

821
00:45:31,793 --> 00:45:33,590
Pretty cool.

822
00:45:33,628 --> 00:45:36,426
Come on. Hurry!

823
00:45:36,465 --> 00:45:40,265
We felt pretty awful
when we let all your bugs out.

824
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:42,770
We promised each other
we wouldn't sleep...

825
00:45:42,804 --> 00:45:45,272
until we brought back
every last bug.

826
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:47,275
You mean
you found my bugs?

827
00:45:47,309 --> 00:45:49,709
Look!

828
00:45:49,745 --> 00:45:51,303
Giant flypaper!

829
00:45:51,346 --> 00:45:53,371
l think we got them all...

830
00:45:53,415 --> 00:45:56,145
but there's still a couple
flapping right there.

831
00:46:03,024 --> 00:46:05,925
The horror! The pain!

832
00:46:09,798 --> 00:46:12,392
-Come on!
-Please!

833
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:15,130
We're sorry!

834
00:46:16,271 --> 00:46:20,332
What l wouldn't do for
just a Big Mac right now.

835
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:22,900
Dude, don't even say
that word.

836
00:46:22,944 --> 00:46:25,412
Two all-beef patties,
special sauce...

837
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:28,746
lettuce, cheese,
pickles, onions...

838
00:46:28,784 --> 00:46:30,945
on a sesame seed bun.

839
00:46:33,455 --> 00:46:35,616
Bladder Buster, no ice.

840
00:46:37,292 --> 00:46:39,419
Breakfast burrito.

841
00:46:39,461 --> 00:46:41,952
l can't take it anymore!

842
00:46:45,634 --> 00:46:47,932
We got to get out of here.

843
00:46:47,969 --> 00:46:50,631
We should relax a little...

844
00:46:50,672 --> 00:46:53,106
before Chaulkner chills out
a little, don't you think?

845
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:55,632
What's he going to do?
Expel us?

846
00:46:56,978 --> 00:46:58,946
You're right, Stub.

847
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,607
We own this place.

848
00:47:00,649 --> 00:47:01,547
Total.

849
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:04,416
The whole world.

850
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,080
Hey, turn into a table.

851
00:47:10,425 --> 00:47:12,017
Uppity-up.

852
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,755
You're pretty steady
on all fours.

853
00:47:13,795 --> 00:47:15,092
Get me up.

854
00:47:19,434 --> 00:47:21,231
Right down here.

855
00:47:21,269 --> 00:47:23,567
You sure?

856
00:47:23,605 --> 00:47:25,402
Look, l can tell it.

857
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,408
My beak has got a hunch.

858
00:47:27,442 --> 00:47:29,273
Like a Doberman pinscher.

859
00:47:40,722 --> 00:47:44,283
The coast is clear.

860
00:47:46,294 --> 00:47:48,387
-Stop!
-Look out.

861
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:49,624
Come down.

862
00:48:00,308 --> 00:48:01,536
This is it.

863
00:48:01,576 --> 00:48:02,702
You sure?

864
00:48:02,744 --> 00:48:04,712
Open it up.
Bring it down.

865
00:48:04,746 --> 00:48:06,236
All right.

866
00:48:07,582 --> 00:48:09,550
Come on. Be careful.

867
00:48:09,584 --> 00:48:10,881
This is the one.

868
00:48:10,919 --> 00:48:13,888
There's food in there.
l feel it.

869
00:48:13,922 --> 00:48:15,412
l feel the aroma.

870
00:48:16,925 --> 00:48:18,825
Hey, Squirl?

871
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,385
lf we blow up,
it's been nice knowing you.

872
00:48:21,429 --> 00:48:23,761
All right. Open it.

873
00:48:27,936 --> 00:48:30,166
Was l right?

874
00:48:30,205 --> 00:48:32,400
Didn't l tell you?

875
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,102
-Who's the master?
-You.

876
00:48:35,143 --> 00:48:36,371
-Who's the king?
-Squirl.

877
00:48:36,411 --> 00:48:38,379
-Who's the shrewdest?
-Squirly.

878
00:48:38,413 --> 00:48:40,506
Just follow your nose.
Let's eat!

879
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:56,191
We have chippies!
Lots of stuff to eat.

880
00:48:57,799 --> 00:48:59,198
ls that laughing gas?

881
00:48:59,234 --> 00:49:00,936
No way.

882
00:49:00,936 --> 00:49:02,403
l don't know.

883
00:49:12,847 --> 00:49:14,246
Turn it on.

884
00:49:19,921 --> 00:49:22,082
Let me try it. Let go.

885
00:49:24,092 --> 00:49:25,559
Dennis Hopper, ''Blue Velvet.''

886
00:49:25,594 --> 00:49:28,427
''Oh, l'm slutty.''

887
00:49:37,606 --> 00:49:39,733
l don't feel anything. You?

888
00:49:39,774 --> 00:49:41,833
Me neither. You?

889
00:49:41,876 --> 00:49:43,173
Nothing.

890
00:49:55,857 --> 00:49:58,917
lt's raining, it's pouring

891
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,053
The old man is snoring

892
00:50:01,096 --> 00:50:02,927
l got to have Spam.

893
00:50:02,964 --> 00:50:06,263
l feel like a duck-billed
platypus, man.

894
00:50:11,106 --> 00:50:12,471
Want halves?

895
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:16,307
Perfect.

896
00:50:21,282 --> 00:50:22,476
Anything?

897
00:50:25,487 --> 00:50:28,979
l didn't feel anything.
Nothing.

898
00:50:44,572 --> 00:50:46,437
Nitrous oxide.
Are you crazy?

899
00:50:50,045 --> 00:50:52,013
What the hell
is going on here?

900
00:50:57,519 --> 00:50:59,510
The desert?
But we'll starve!

901
00:50:59,554 --> 00:51:00,714
Not necessarily.

902
00:51:00,755 --> 00:51:03,451
lt is life
on a taut tensile line...

903
00:51:03,491 --> 00:51:05,925
but the desert is
an integral part of nature.

904
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,120
Unbelievable.

905
00:51:07,162 --> 00:51:09,926
So it's just vamos,
get out of here.

906
00:51:09,964 --> 00:51:13,127
You guys go your thing,
and we go ours.

907
00:51:13,168 --> 00:51:15,932
The idea being
that while we are here...

908
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:18,200
you are there.

909
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:21,265
Like we want to hang with
you guys anymore.

910
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:23,937
We're going to start
our own Bio-Dome.

911
00:51:23,978 --> 00:51:26,446
One with a dome within a dome!

912
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:28,210
So don't come knocking
on our door.

913
00:51:28,249 --> 00:51:30,444
Do you understand?

914
00:51:30,485 --> 00:51:32,544
All we need are two helpers.

915
00:51:32,587 --> 00:51:34,282
Girls, come with us...

916
00:51:34,322 --> 00:51:37,985
because girls are
an integral part of nature, too.

917
00:51:38,026 --> 00:51:40,722
Yeah, come on.

918
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,561
We still got each other, Squirl.

919
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:54,072
You won't have to eat
any more of that food.

920
00:52:03,451 --> 00:52:07,114
Girls, don't do this.

921
00:52:07,155 --> 00:52:11,023
-l can't see you.
-Where'd they go?

922
00:52:17,826 --> 00:52:19,487
l'm so hungry.

923
00:52:19,527 --> 00:52:23,588
We got to get out of here.

924
00:52:28,303 --> 00:52:30,464
l don't want
to have to eat you.

925
00:52:32,373 --> 00:52:34,864
l don't want you to eat me,
either.

926
00:52:42,217 --> 00:52:46,745
Squirl, the Grim Reaper
is breathing down our necks.

927
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:50,189
lt's not looking too good.

928
00:52:50,225 --> 00:52:53,683
There's something l have to get
off my chest before we die.

929
00:52:53,728 --> 00:52:56,128
Remember that really cute...

930
00:52:56,164 --> 00:52:58,598
little teeny, little tiny,
little turtle...

931
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:01,193
you had when we were growing up
that disappeared...

932
00:53:01,236 --> 00:53:04,399
and then they put your kitty cat
to sleep for eating him?

933
00:53:04,439 --> 00:53:09,206
What really happened was
is that l stepped on him.

934
00:53:09,244 --> 00:53:11,144
And then l flushed him
down the toilet...

935
00:53:11,179 --> 00:53:13,170
and let the cat take the rap.

936
00:53:13,214 --> 00:53:14,738
Frisky?

937
00:53:14,782 --> 00:53:16,773
He went down like a champ,
Squirl.

938
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,514
Remember your Uncle Murray
divorced your Aunt Flo...

939
00:53:19,554 --> 00:53:21,886
for sleeping with
that flamingo dancer?

940
00:53:21,923 --> 00:53:24,585
Her children disowned her,
the church shunned her.

941
00:53:24,626 --> 00:53:26,526
She started a drinking binge.

942
00:53:26,561 --> 00:53:30,998
That flamingo dancer's outfit
he found was mine.

943
00:53:32,934 --> 00:53:34,629
My mom was trying to make me
take lessons...

944
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,330
to impress the neighbors.

945
00:53:36,371 --> 00:53:40,102
So l took the outfit,
l hid it in Aunt Flo's bedroom.

946
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:42,701
l said l got mugged.

947
00:53:42,744 --> 00:53:45,338
Aunt Flo's insane now.

948
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:48,213
Yeah,
but she has her independence.

949
00:53:48,249 --> 00:53:52,185
Remember
the Great Fire of 1979...

950
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,245
that supposedly started
in your garage...

951
00:53:54,289 --> 00:53:56,621
when that chipmunk
ingested some fertilizer...

952
00:53:56,658 --> 00:53:58,956
and then fell
into a can of kerosene...

953
00:53:58,993 --> 00:54:01,325
instantly turning him
into a flying little...

954
00:54:01,362 --> 00:54:03,956
fluffy Molotov cocktail
that set a blaze...

955
00:54:03,998 --> 00:54:05,488
leveling
the whole neighborhood...

956
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:08,832
west of
Newton's hardware store?

957
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,168
You started that fire?

958
00:54:15,109 --> 00:54:17,339
No, but that was
pretty cool, huh?

959
00:54:24,285 --> 00:54:27,721
-Noah.
-Can we talk to you?

960
00:54:29,457 --> 00:54:31,584
We're concerned
about Bud and Doyle.

961
00:54:31,626 --> 00:54:33,423
We think they've been
down there for long enough.

962
00:54:33,461 --> 00:54:35,361
Do you?

963
00:54:35,396 --> 00:54:37,159
Yes.
We can't just leave them there.

964
00:54:37,198 --> 00:54:40,031
-They can't survive.
-lt would be murder.

965
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,536
No. lt's progress.

966
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,038
We're culling the herd.

967
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,335
They are a symbol...

968
00:54:46,374 --> 00:54:50,174
of everything
that is wrong with this world.

969
00:54:50,211 --> 00:54:54,113
They don't care.
They don't matter.

970
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:00,986
Doyle, there's a tasty dactyl.

971
00:55:06,961 --> 00:55:10,453
-Got him, Squirl.
-l'm going to eat you.

972
00:55:11,499 --> 00:55:14,866
l want to eat them
with the frog leg.

973
00:55:14,902 --> 00:55:17,200
Squirl, wait, wait, wait!

974
00:55:17,238 --> 00:55:18,705
A key!

975
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,074
No way!

976
00:55:29,917 --> 00:55:31,612
Parking tickets?

977
00:55:34,656 --> 00:55:36,817
-What am l going to--
-After all we've done--

978
00:55:36,858 --> 00:55:38,917
Oh, my--A boot.

979
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,894
l can't believe it.

980
00:55:40,928 --> 00:55:43,726
l can't believe
they would put a boot...

981
00:55:43,765 --> 00:55:46,461
on a Bio-Dome scientist's car.

982
00:55:46,501 --> 00:55:50,835
lt's not like we didn't try
to help the ecological system.

983
00:55:50,872 --> 00:55:54,035
Aw, don't cry, Doyle.
lt's OK.

984
00:55:54,075 --> 00:55:56,771
Here. Come on.
We'll get you some food.

985
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,676
A little Bladder Buster?

986
00:55:58,713 --> 00:56:02,877
-Hey, coach! Pizza!
-Stop!

987
00:56:05,086 --> 00:56:07,020
Here are the pizzas.
The Bladder Busters are free...

988
00:56:07,055 --> 00:56:10,047
because l couldn't find
the goddamn place.

989
00:56:10,091 --> 00:56:12,059
Russell?

990
00:56:13,061 --> 00:56:17,122
-Bob.
-How did you get a job?

991
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,395
Fucking President Clinton.

992
00:56:19,434 --> 00:56:22,164
You had sex with
President Clinton?

993
00:56:22,203 --> 00:56:24,228
That's pretty cool.

994
00:56:24,272 --> 00:56:26,399
So, how's my juicy treat?

995
00:56:26,441 --> 00:56:28,466
She and that other bimbo...

996
00:56:28,509 --> 00:56:31,239
they picked up two guys
at Arizona Tech.

997
00:56:31,279 --> 00:56:34,407
They're having a party
to save the environment.

998
00:56:34,449 --> 00:56:37,976
You owe me $57.50--plus a tip.

999
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,543
What does ''in the flesh'' mean?

1000
00:56:39,587 --> 00:56:43,045
l think it has
something to do with tassels.

1001
00:56:43,091 --> 00:56:45,855
You got to take us
to this party.

1002
00:56:45,893 --> 00:56:49,056
l got pies to deliver.
Get off the goddamn car!

1003
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,735
Can you believe this?

1004
00:56:56,771 --> 00:57:00,468
Right now, the whole ATU campus
is probably being overrun...

1005
00:57:00,508 --> 00:57:03,443
by some touchy-feely,
''save the environment'' mania...

1006
00:57:03,478 --> 00:57:05,241
and guess who's
right in the middle of it.

1007
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,804
Our chicks. They're probably
swapping Mark Spitz...

1008
00:57:07,849 --> 00:57:10,113
with those grape smugglers
right now.

1009
00:57:10,151 --> 00:57:13,348
No preppy blow-hard is going to
steal my chick without a fight.

1010
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:15,549
First Frisky, now this.

1011
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:17,558
All l know is
someone's going down!

1012
00:57:17,592 --> 00:57:22,427
Hey, put the gun away, Stub.
Stub, put the gun away.

1013
00:57:22,463 --> 00:57:26,126
Evil is not a good thing
right now. Just relax. Exhale.

1014
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:29,398
All we got to do, bro,
is outparty the partyers.

1015
00:57:29,437 --> 00:57:32,235
Bring the mountain to Mohammed.

1016
00:57:32,273 --> 00:57:35,970
Throw a bigger bash than
any college would ever allow.

1017
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:41,243
Show the girls that we care
about the environment, too.

1018
00:57:41,282 --> 00:57:43,773
-Do we?
-No.

1019
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,915
Where are we going
to throw this party?

1020
00:57:52,293 --> 00:57:56,024
Viva Los Bio-Dome!

1021
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,972
Cornicopy-a. Roach here.

1022
00:58:08,009 --> 00:58:10,102
Roach, it's me, Bud.

1023
00:58:10,144 --> 00:58:13,511
Thanks for blowing me off
on my birthday, nature boy.

1024
00:58:13,548 --> 00:58:15,140
l guess now
that you're Mr. Scientist...

1025
00:58:15,183 --> 00:58:18,277
you don't have time for
your bourgeois friends anymore.

1026
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:20,913
Don't bourgeois
shmougeois me, OK?

1027
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,889
We've been stuck in a bubble.

1028
00:58:22,924 --> 00:58:24,721
Look, you've got
to do me a favor.

1029
00:58:24,759 --> 00:58:27,284
Remember last year
when we had that big, like...

1030
00:58:27,328 --> 00:58:29,159
freaked-out festival
and stuff...

1031
00:58:29,197 --> 00:58:31,529
and l made you my little buddy,
and you went and passed--

1032
00:58:31,566 --> 00:58:34,262
Give me the drink! Wait.

1033
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,294
And l made you pass out fliers?

1034
00:58:37,338 --> 00:58:40,796
l need you to do the same
thing, but this time--whoo!

1035
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:45,238
First you need the planet

1036
00:58:45,279 --> 00:58:47,474
The earth beneath your feet

1037
00:58:47,515 --> 00:58:52,009
You couldn't live
an instant without that

1038
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:54,578
Then you need the air

1039
00:58:54,622 --> 00:58:57,284
OK, everybody turn!

1040
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:01,659
Couldn't live five minutes
without that

1041
00:59:01,696 --> 00:59:02,822
Can someone please explain...

1042
00:59:02,864 --> 00:59:04,855
how drinking beer
and playing hacky sack...

1043
00:59:04,899 --> 00:59:06,628
can help improve
the environment?

1044
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:09,158
lt's all about
raising consciousness.

1045
00:59:09,203 --> 00:59:12,331
You just can't stand up
and preach about it.

1046
00:59:12,373 --> 00:59:15,706
Let me open up your chakras,
Monique.

1047
00:59:15,743 --> 00:59:17,506
No, thanks, Siddhartha.

1048
00:59:17,545 --> 00:59:19,570
What we need
is to save some trees

1049
00:59:19,614 --> 00:59:21,912
We just want to save some trees

1050
00:59:21,949 --> 00:59:24,897
Don't say we didn't save
some friggin' trees

1051
00:59:27,733 --> 00:59:30,702
Party at Bio-Dome?
All right, let's go!

1052
00:59:30,736 --> 00:59:33,864
Bud and Doyle are having
a party at the Bio-Dome?

1053
00:59:33,906 --> 00:59:35,635
That's crazy.
What are they thinking?

1054
00:59:35,675 --> 00:59:37,540
-How?
-What about our party?

1055
00:59:37,577 --> 00:59:40,045
Blow me, partner.
We're going to Bio-Dome.

1056
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,671
Thanks for the back rub.

1057
00:59:43,749 --> 00:59:47,048
Maybe they're planning on
a lecture in the parking lot.

1058
00:59:47,086 --> 00:59:50,249
Wouldn't it be cool if they had
those huge television setups...

1059
00:59:50,289 --> 00:59:52,314
so we could see
what's going on inside?

1060
00:59:55,027 --> 00:59:58,986
-Moths?
-Noctuidae principalis.

1061
00:59:59,031 --> 01:00:01,659
-We don't have them here.
-Something is happening.

1062
01:00:01,701 --> 01:00:03,396
Have you seen her face?

1063
01:00:03,436 --> 01:00:07,065
She's got a face
that could stop a clock...

1064
01:00:09,408 --> 01:00:14,072
Until you look her in the eyes

1065
01:00:14,113 --> 01:00:16,081
And her money's green

1066
01:00:16,115 --> 01:00:19,050
She's a tease
like a social disease

1067
01:00:19,085 --> 01:00:22,179
She seems so close to my reach

1068
01:00:22,221 --> 01:00:26,385
lf l could count,
l could count it all

1069
01:00:26,425 --> 01:00:28,450
Lady, turn me on

1070
01:00:28,494 --> 01:00:30,462
Lady, turn me on

1071
01:00:30,496 --> 01:00:33,090
Lady, turn me on

1072
01:00:33,132 --> 01:00:34,724
Lady, turn me on

1073
01:00:34,767 --> 01:00:36,894
Jackknife!

1074
01:00:36,936 --> 01:00:40,235
You can take her for a ride

1075
01:00:40,273 --> 01:00:41,706
Are you guys in a band?

1076
01:00:41,741 --> 01:00:43,766
We're the Bio-Dome Five.

1077
01:00:43,809 --> 01:00:46,539
Which one's Tito?

1078
01:00:46,579 --> 01:00:48,911
And l can't even fake a smile

1079
01:00:48,948 --> 01:00:51,576
Without laughing inside
all the while

1080
01:01:00,126 --> 01:01:01,991
He's a whore,
do anything for money

1081
01:01:02,028 --> 01:01:03,893
He's a whore

1082
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:05,557
There is no law now!

1083
01:01:05,598 --> 01:01:07,657
Do anything for money,
he's a whore

1084
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,930
And the stories l could tell

1085
01:01:13,673 --> 01:01:15,573
Look out!

1086
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:18,904
Oh, my God!

1087
01:01:18,945 --> 01:01:21,971
They're going inside?

1088
01:01:22,014 --> 01:01:23,948
l'm a whore,
do anything for money

1089
01:01:23,983 --> 01:01:27,009
l'm a whore,
so the story goes

1090
01:01:27,053 --> 01:01:31,285
Monique, Jen. Buona notte.

1091
01:01:31,324 --> 01:01:34,020
-Where are they?
-Bud and Doyle?

1092
01:01:38,064 --> 01:01:39,588
Here you are. Half-price.

1093
01:01:39,632 --> 01:01:41,463
Yeah, right.

1094
01:01:42,902 --> 01:01:45,632
Fine.
Be that way, snivelers.

1095
01:01:50,343 --> 01:01:53,801
Oh, my!

1096
01:01:53,846 --> 01:01:56,872
This can't be.

1097
01:01:56,916 --> 01:01:58,110
En garde.

1098
01:02:03,356 --> 01:02:05,847
-What are you doing?
-We're partying.

1099
01:02:05,891 --> 01:02:08,451
You're thrashing this place,
you phonies.

1100
01:02:10,229 --> 01:02:11,355
So?

1101
01:02:11,397 --> 01:02:13,490
l thought you cared
about the environment.

1102
01:02:13,532 --> 01:02:15,830
No.
We just want to get laid.

1103
01:02:18,938 --> 01:02:21,771
Hell, l'd strangle a dolphin
to get into her pants.

1104
01:02:22,942 --> 01:02:24,239
Bud and Doyle!

1105
01:02:28,881 --> 01:02:32,840
Hey, everybody,
welcome to the party!

1106
01:02:32,885 --> 01:02:35,410
l could get used to this,
Squirl.

1107
01:02:35,454 --> 01:02:38,685
lt was just a matter of time.

1108
01:02:44,463 --> 01:02:47,227
Monique, Jen,
welcome to paradise!

1109
01:02:47,266 --> 01:02:50,099
Ladies, so good of you to come.

1110
01:02:50,136 --> 01:02:52,104
Join us!

1111
01:02:52,138 --> 01:02:54,732
My queen,
this is your kingdom...

1112
01:02:54,774 --> 01:02:59,677
and now we're all
acting globally.

1113
01:03:03,249 --> 01:03:05,012
Bud, stop this!

1114
01:03:05,051 --> 01:03:07,315
-Stop what?
-This!

1115
01:03:07,353 --> 01:03:10,220
Doyle, look at this place.
lt's being destroyed.

1116
01:03:10,256 --> 01:03:13,783
l thought you guys wanted
a big environmental party.

1117
01:03:13,826 --> 01:03:15,191
You assholes!

1118
01:03:15,227 --> 01:03:17,889
Don't you care about anything?

1119
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:20,922
Bud, you're killing
the Bio-Dome.

1120
01:04:15,387 --> 01:04:17,855
You shouldn't be doing this.
This is our mess.

1121
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:19,482
This is our problem.

1122
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:26,428
Don't touch me.

1123
01:04:26,465 --> 01:04:29,457
Stop! Come on, you guys.
You're making us feel worse.

1124
01:04:29,502 --> 01:04:30,628
Good.

1125
01:04:30,669 --> 01:04:32,466
Do you guys even realize
what you've done?

1126
01:04:32,505 --> 01:04:34,166
You're scum.

1127
01:04:34,206 --> 01:04:36,834
You know how embarrassed l am
that l even know you?

1128
01:04:39,578 --> 01:04:41,637
-We're sorry.
-Yeah, we didn't think.

1129
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,875
That's the problem, Bud.

1130
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:46,942
-You never think.
-About anything.

1131
01:04:47,987 --> 01:04:49,784
Wait. Monique, stop!

1132
01:04:51,023 --> 01:04:52,456
Can we call you later?

1133
01:04:52,491 --> 01:04:54,482
Bud, this isn't a joke.

1134
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:57,121
l never want to see you again.

1135
01:04:59,799 --> 01:05:02,859
-l don't know you.
-l'm Doyle Johnson.

1136
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:05,166
You've seen me naked.

1137
01:05:26,892 --> 01:05:29,156
Faulkner's gone.

1138
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:31,959
He disappeared.

1139
01:05:31,997 --> 01:05:34,557
All we found were these.

1140
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,398
They look as though
they've been chewed by a rat.

1141
01:05:37,436 --> 01:05:40,234
The first rat
to desert a sinking ship.

1142
01:05:40,272 --> 01:05:43,605
Romulus, l should have
left you in charge.

1143
01:05:46,111 --> 01:05:49,376
Well, maybe not.

1144
01:05:49,415 --> 01:05:52,612
Mr. Leaky?
The damage is devastating.

1145
01:05:52,651 --> 01:05:54,636
The toxins
are way off the scale...

1146
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:57,830
and the pH is acidic enough
to digest a battery.

1147
01:05:57,873 --> 01:06:01,240
lt took years
to build this world...

1148
01:06:01,276 --> 01:06:05,474
and you geniuses took
only one month to destroy it.

1149
01:06:05,514 --> 01:06:08,415
God couldn't work
at such a fast pace.

1150
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:11,419
l haven't seen devastation
of this magnitude...

1151
01:06:11,453 --> 01:06:13,683
since the Great Chipmunk Fire
of '79.

1152
01:06:16,892 --> 01:06:20,953
Go home. lt's over.

1153
01:06:22,631 --> 01:06:24,599
We made Vasquez Lake.

1154
01:06:24,933 --> 01:06:27,959
-We got to fix it.
-We got to.

1155
01:06:30,572 --> 01:06:33,268
-Where are you guys headed?
-Out.

1156
01:06:33,308 --> 01:06:34,434
Well, wait.

1157
01:06:34,476 --> 01:06:36,842
You can't leave.
We're going to need your help.

1158
01:06:36,878 --> 01:06:39,142
-For what?
-To clean this place up.

1159
01:06:39,181 --> 01:06:42,173
There's no point in staying.
The ecosystem is dead.

1160
01:06:42,217 --> 01:06:43,775
lt's not dead.
lt's just thrashed.

1161
01:06:43,819 --> 01:06:45,548
The point was to live
in a sealed environment...

1162
01:06:45,587 --> 01:06:47,145
and maintain
perfect homeostasis...

1163
01:06:47,189 --> 01:06:48,816
without contact
from the outside world.

1164
01:06:48,857 --> 01:06:51,826
The entire experiment
has been compromised.

1165
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,054
Wait!

1166
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:00,164
Screw the experiment!

1167
01:07:01,703 --> 01:07:03,398
No one leaves.

1168
01:07:03,438 --> 01:07:05,497
Now, listen!

1169
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:07,804
We're taking over this dome...

1170
01:07:07,843 --> 01:07:10,573
and you guys
are going to help us fix it.

1171
01:07:10,612 --> 01:07:13,103
Do you have any idea
how impossible it would be...

1172
01:07:13,148 --> 01:07:14,877
to make this place
habitable again?

1173
01:07:14,916 --> 01:07:17,510
lmpossible is my nom de plumb.

1174
01:07:17,552 --> 01:07:21,113
Now, you guys have spent
your whole lives...

1175
01:07:21,156 --> 01:07:23,147
trying to make the world
a better place, right?

1176
01:07:23,191 --> 01:07:24,488
Well, here's your chance.

1177
01:07:24,526 --> 01:07:29,156
Only it's not perfect.
lt's like it is out there.

1178
01:07:29,197 --> 01:07:31,461
Come on, guys.

1179
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,627
We got to save the Bio-Dome.

1180
01:07:35,971 --> 01:07:38,496
l've never quit anything
in my whole life...

1181
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:40,098
except Chinese calligraphy...

1182
01:07:40,142 --> 01:07:42,337
my thesis, ''Tuna and you--
the early years''...

1183
01:07:42,377 --> 01:07:44,937
Kangaroo anatomy,
toe photography...

1184
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:47,847
booger sculpture,
and masturbation.

1185
01:07:47,883 --> 01:07:51,148
Well, maybe not masturbation,
but give me a break.

1186
01:07:51,186 --> 01:07:52,778
lt's the only thing
l'm good at.

1187
01:07:52,821 --> 01:07:56,985
You are very good at it, Stub--
very good.

1188
01:07:57,025 --> 01:07:59,152
So come on.
Who's a quitter?

1189
01:08:03,665 --> 01:08:06,133
ln five seconds, l'm going
to swallow this key...

1190
01:08:06,168 --> 01:08:09,934
so if you want to leave,
you better do it now.

1191
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,474
Count it, Squirl.

1192
01:08:12,474 --> 01:08:13,634
One...

1193
01:08:15,043 --> 01:08:16,442
two...

1194
01:08:17,612 --> 01:08:19,079
l'll do it.

1195
01:08:19,114 --> 01:08:20,308
three...

1196
01:08:22,617 --> 01:08:23,743
four...

1197
01:08:23,785 --> 01:08:27,152
Wait, wait, wait.
l don't want to get locked in.

1198
01:08:27,189 --> 01:08:29,817
Just wait one second, please.

1199
01:08:29,858 --> 01:08:32,520
Let me out of here.
Don't. Open the door.

1200
01:08:32,561 --> 01:08:35,052
Thank you, Bob.
Nice to see you again, Darrell.

1201
01:08:44,906 --> 01:08:46,203
Last chance.

1202
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:49,267
Five.

1203
01:08:56,385 --> 01:08:57,511
Dick!

1204
01:08:57,552 --> 01:09:00,749
Oh, my God. You did it.

1205
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:03,257
We're all going to die!

1206
01:09:05,994 --> 01:09:09,555
Grouse mate for life,
year after year after year.

1207
01:09:09,598 --> 01:09:12,726
They travel thousands of miles
to reunite and mate.

1208
01:09:14,603 --> 01:09:16,400
We were watching that.

1209
01:09:16,438 --> 01:09:18,406
l'll put it right back.
l want to see if the sniper...

1210
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:19,771
killed the clown at the mall.

1211
01:09:19,808 --> 01:09:22,003
lf we slow it down, we can
actually see the bullets...

1212
01:09:22,043 --> 01:09:24,910
enter and exit Buttercup.

1213
01:09:24,946 --> 01:09:27,608
-Ew!
-Gross!

1214
01:09:27,649 --> 01:09:29,048
Back and to the left.

1215
01:09:35,991 --> 01:09:37,185
A clown.

1216
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,656
The infamous Bio-Dome
is back in the news.

1217
01:09:41,696 --> 01:09:43,687
lt seems a standoff
has developed...

1218
01:09:43,732 --> 01:09:45,996
between scientists
still inside...

1219
01:09:46,034 --> 01:09:47,524
and project investors.

1220
01:09:47,569 --> 01:09:50,561
Our Joachim West
is live at the scene.

1221
01:09:50,605 --> 01:09:52,334
Aries,
the Bio-Dome scientists...

1222
01:09:52,374 --> 01:09:54,433
are refusing to leave
the world they destroyed.

1223
01:09:54,476 --> 01:09:56,239
Bud and Doyle, l love you!

1224
01:09:56,278 --> 01:09:58,803
-A standoff?
-Hold it. There's Mr. Leaky...

1225
01:09:58,847 --> 01:10:00,371
the project's
principal investor.

1226
01:10:00,415 --> 01:10:03,009
l studied chemistry in Sweden!

1227
01:10:03,051 --> 01:10:04,382
l can lick my back!

1228
01:10:04,419 --> 01:10:08,719
All l can say right now
is we're still negotiating.

1229
01:10:08,757 --> 01:10:10,247
We're trying
to keep them aware...

1230
01:10:10,292 --> 01:10:14,160
of the dangerously
low level of oxygen inside.

1231
01:10:14,196 --> 01:10:15,788
That's all for now.

1232
01:10:15,897 --> 01:10:18,832
Homeostasis is 1% of normal.

1233
01:10:18,867 --> 01:10:21,665
Animal life will terminate
in fourteen days.

1234
01:10:21,703 --> 01:10:23,671
Fourteen days?
That's almost two weeks.

1235
01:10:23,705 --> 01:10:26,139
This is madness.
l don't see how it can be done.

1236
01:10:29,578 --> 01:10:32,638
Bingo! Revive plant life.

1237
01:10:34,549 --> 01:10:37,541
See? Now the plants
will get that island tan.

1238
01:10:37,586 --> 01:10:39,679
Photosynthesize, planties.

1239
01:10:39,721 --> 01:10:40,949
Hopefully,
it will also produce...

1240
01:10:40,989 --> 01:10:43,116
what Doyle and l call
the beer can effect...

1241
01:10:43,158 --> 01:10:47,185
whereby heat inside
will stimulate condensation...

1242
01:10:47,229 --> 01:10:49,254
you know, like the outside
of a cold brew.

1243
01:10:49,297 --> 01:10:51,231
That should increase
the moisture inside here...

1244
01:10:51,266 --> 01:10:53,063
and bring on
a nice little downpour.

1245
01:10:53,101 --> 01:10:55,899
lt'll work. All we got to do
is filter the air.

1246
01:10:55,937 --> 01:10:57,234
Light bulb!

1247
01:10:58,673 --> 01:11:00,641
Making a filter

1248
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:09,911
Don't worry, Stub.

1249
01:11:09,951 --> 01:11:12,920
Olivia said we could just use
wet bed sheets.

1250
01:11:12,954 --> 01:11:16,481
-What about all these butts?
-At least you collected them.

1251
01:11:16,525 --> 01:11:19,653
Do you know how many laws
you've broken?

1252
01:11:19,694 --> 01:11:21,753
How many?

1253
01:11:21,796 --> 01:11:26,597
Bud, Doyle, where's the key
to the back door?

1254
01:11:26,635 --> 01:11:29,627
-Doyle's got it.
-Thank God!

1255
01:11:29,671 --> 01:11:32,697
-Doyle, give me the key.
-Give the man the key.

1256
01:11:32,741 --> 01:11:35,266
-You sure?
-Give him the key.

1257
01:11:43,051 --> 01:11:45,519
Push!

1258
01:11:45,554 --> 01:11:48,580
He needs a cup of joe
to let it flow!

1259
01:11:48,623 --> 01:11:54,084
Leaky, reach on up
in there and get it!

1260
01:11:54,129 --> 01:11:56,427
But make sure
you take off your watch.

1261
01:11:56,464 --> 01:11:58,523
No, l was the last one
out, right?

1262
01:11:58,567 --> 01:12:00,694
And Bob, the last words
he said to me were...

1263
01:12:00,735 --> 01:12:02,760
''lf l go, man,
you take the torch.

1264
01:12:02,804 --> 01:12:05,272
''You save the planet.''
Right? And l'm like, ''Wild!''

1265
01:12:05,307 --> 01:12:06,865
-Excuse me.
-Monique!

1266
01:12:06,908 --> 01:12:09,741
l see Mom
let you off your leash.

1267
01:12:12,414 --> 01:12:16,111
Bud and Doyle refuse to speak
to anyone but you.

1268
01:12:16,151 --> 01:12:18,449
You would be doing the world
and posterity...

1269
01:12:18,486 --> 01:12:21,819
a great favor if you could
convince them both...

1270
01:12:21,856 --> 01:12:24,689
to give up
this foolish quest.

1271
01:12:26,895 --> 01:12:28,089
Hi, guys.

1272
01:12:32,133 --> 01:12:34,328
So, uh...

1273
01:12:34,369 --> 01:12:36,735
So when are you guys
going to come out?

1274
01:12:36,771 --> 01:12:39,706
Earth Day.

1275
01:12:39,741 --> 01:12:41,504
You guys still mad at us?

1276
01:12:41,543 --> 01:12:44,171
ls that what this is all about?

1277
01:12:44,212 --> 01:12:47,613
This isn't one of our pranks.
We're for real.

1278
01:12:47,649 --> 01:12:49,708
You're really for real?

1279
01:12:49,751 --> 01:12:52,345
We think about you guys
all the time.

1280
01:12:52,387 --> 01:12:54,480
We miss you, too.

1281
01:12:56,625 --> 01:12:59,253
You've come a long way, Bud.

1282
01:13:09,204 --> 01:13:13,538
Thanks.
That really helped a lot.

1283
01:13:13,575 --> 01:13:17,375
l've used this technique
in many siege situations.

1284
01:13:17,412 --> 01:13:21,371
lt's pure torture. This will
definitely drive them out.

1285
01:13:21,416 --> 01:13:22,678
You're the expert.

1286
01:13:42,899 --> 01:13:44,867
Good boy, Billy. Good boy.

1287
01:13:44,901 --> 01:13:46,334
Come on. Come on.

1288
01:13:48,071 --> 01:13:51,006
Romulus!
Your papalopadus are porking!

1289
01:13:58,448 --> 01:14:00,678
Excellent tree bark, y'all.

1290
01:14:00,717 --> 01:14:02,514
Tastes just like chicken.

1291
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,051
Here you go, friend.

1292
01:14:09,826 --> 01:14:12,317
48% of normal!

1293
01:14:13,663 --> 01:14:17,497
lt's really like l have
two sons--Doyle and Bud.

1294
01:14:22,505 --> 01:14:25,167
l have one from L'lnstitut
de Nature in Strasbourg.

1295
01:14:25,208 --> 01:14:28,075
They want Bud and Doyle
to stockpile their sperm bank.

1296
01:14:28,111 --> 01:14:29,908
This one's from the people
at Bladder Buster.

1297
01:14:29,946 --> 01:14:31,277
They want the boys
to endorse their new drink--

1298
01:14:31,314 --> 01:14:33,077
the Colonic Cannon.

1299
01:14:33,116 --> 01:14:36,313
You're not going to believe
who this one's from.

1300
01:14:36,352 --> 01:14:41,051
''Viva Los Bio-Dome!''

1301
01:14:42,292 --> 01:14:44,852
Might be quite hard. Take
the right leg. Throw it up.

1302
01:14:44,894 --> 01:14:48,261
Push it to your chest
and then behind the head.

1303
01:14:48,298 --> 01:14:50,789
We could grow
a whole new crop of tomatoes.

1304
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:52,767
Trick or treat!

1305
01:14:54,037 --> 01:14:56,232
What, you guys
don't have any candy?

1306
01:14:56,272 --> 01:14:59,833
Oh, Mr. Dude, look at you.

1307
01:14:59,876 --> 01:15:02,845
And what's your little name?

1308
01:15:02,879 --> 01:15:05,347
Purple sticky ponge.

1309
01:15:05,381 --> 01:15:08,942
You're going to make someone
really happy.

1310
01:15:12,956 --> 01:15:15,789
Checking Santa's list...

1311
01:15:15,825 --> 01:15:18,316
to see who's been
naughty and nice.

1312
01:15:18,361 --> 01:15:19,919
Bud and Doyle!

1313
01:15:29,339 --> 01:15:32,638
Happy New Year!

1314
01:15:56,366 --> 01:15:59,335
Crunchy soy patty...

1315
01:15:59,369 --> 01:16:01,667
with lactose-free cheese?

1316
01:16:01,704 --> 01:16:04,002
l need a fuse.

1317
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:07,032
lonized porkodilineate...

1318
01:16:07,076 --> 01:16:08,805
with red dye number two?

1319
01:16:11,714 --> 01:16:13,272
Yeah. Keep going.

1320
01:16:13,316 --> 01:16:16,376
What senseless vandalism.

1321
01:16:16,419 --> 01:16:18,114
Do you think
it's really Faulkner?

1322
01:16:18,154 --> 01:16:20,622
Whoever was in this closet knew
what they were looking for.

1323
01:16:20,657 --> 01:16:22,591
l want to talk to him
and tell him we're sorry...

1324
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:24,286
and that we're going to try
and make up for it.

1325
01:16:24,327 --> 01:16:27,490
We should get him back here,
involved, you know?

1326
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:29,157
We could use another genius.

1327
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:30,825
l don't think
that's a very good idea.

1328
01:16:30,867 --> 01:16:32,698
lf he wanted to talk,
he would have come to us.

1329
01:16:32,735 --> 01:16:35,761
What do you think
he's been doing all this time?

1330
01:16:40,843 --> 01:16:44,301
Ramona

1331
01:16:44,347 --> 01:16:46,315
l will fly

1332
01:16:46,349 --> 01:16:47,543
l am God.

1333
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:00,658
No. l am God.

1334
01:17:05,535 --> 01:17:07,162
All is peaceful and quiet
here tonight...

1335
01:17:07,203 --> 01:17:09,831
as the domers
spend their last days inside...

1336
01:17:09,872 --> 01:17:11,396
trying to reach homeostasis.

1337
01:17:11,441 --> 01:17:13,432
This is Joachim West reporting.

1338
01:17:13,476 --> 01:17:16,673
lt's going to be a real blast--
three-day rally to boycott fur.

1339
01:17:16,713 --> 01:17:19,238
Why don't you start with
the fur on your back, homo?

1340
01:17:19,282 --> 01:17:20,943
Sapiens.

1341
01:17:20,983 --> 01:17:23,144
That was good.

1342
01:17:25,822 --> 01:17:28,313
No. l am God.

1343
01:17:33,229 --> 01:17:34,097
Homeostasis is at 98%.

1344
01:17:34,097 --> 01:17:35,257
Homeostasis is at 98%.

1345
01:17:35,298 --> 01:17:38,699
We're close. lt's going
to come down to the wire.

1346
01:17:38,735 --> 01:17:40,669
Only ten hours left.

1347
01:17:40,703 --> 01:17:42,671
lf only we had another day.

1348
01:17:42,705 --> 01:17:44,400
Or another twenty-four hours.

1349
01:18:08,898 --> 01:18:10,365
Ladies.

1350
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,867
Hey, guys.

1351
01:18:11,901 --> 01:18:13,801
We just...

1352
01:18:13,836 --> 01:18:17,101
we wanted to say
thanks for everything.

1353
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:20,075
We thought you were
brain-damaged or something...

1354
01:18:20,109 --> 01:18:22,304
but we were wrong.

1355
01:18:22,345 --> 01:18:23,607
You're very special.

1356
01:18:23,646 --> 01:18:26,843
You mean special,
like riding on...

1357
01:18:26,883 --> 01:18:28,817
the little yellow bus
to school special?

1358
01:18:28,851 --> 01:18:30,284
Very special.

1359
01:18:30,319 --> 01:18:34,119
And, Doyle, l've been thinking
about that yogurt thing.

1360
01:18:34,157 --> 01:18:37,923
Fruit at the bottom,
waiting to be stirred.

1361
01:18:54,844 --> 01:18:57,779
Wait. l have a girlfriend.

1362
01:19:07,957 --> 01:19:09,857
Excuse me. l'm sorry.

1363
01:19:20,803 --> 01:19:22,270
We're sorry. lt's just...

1364
01:19:22,305 --> 01:19:24,569
we have girlfriends
on the outside of the dome...

1365
01:19:24,607 --> 01:19:25,733
but you are just fan--

1366
01:19:25,775 --> 01:19:28,039
Good night, Squirly.

1367
01:19:28,077 --> 01:19:29,408
-Good night, Doyle.
-Wait.

1368
01:19:36,819 --> 01:19:38,286
That might have been...

1369
01:19:38,321 --> 01:19:40,289
the smartest
or the dumbest thing...

1370
01:19:40,323 --> 01:19:42,257
we've ever done in our lives.

1371
01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:43,485
Probably both.

1372
01:19:46,829 --> 01:19:49,263
What's that noise?

1373
01:19:49,298 --> 01:19:51,289
-What?
-Do you hear that?

1374
01:19:51,334 --> 01:19:52,733
-Yeah. What is it?
-l don't know.

1375
01:20:03,212 --> 01:20:04,645
Wow!

1376
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:08,081
Check out Faulkner's
secret hatch action.

1377
01:20:08,117 --> 01:20:11,018
-Cool.
-Yes. How James Bondish.

1378
01:20:12,388 --> 01:20:13,514
Hurry up.

1379
01:20:19,829 --> 01:20:21,387
Come on, Stub.

1380
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,267
Wow.

1381
01:20:26,302 --> 01:20:27,963
What is that?

1382
01:20:30,139 --> 01:20:32,607
Ahoy, Noah!

1383
01:20:32,642 --> 01:20:34,041
Matey!

1384
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:38,187
You don't look so good.

1385
01:20:38,224 --> 01:20:40,215
You're looking kind of grisly.

1386
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:45,596
l--l have
a lovely sack of coconuts...

1387
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:49,068
that l've altered
in a small way...

1388
01:20:49,102 --> 01:20:50,865
and l wondered...

1389
01:20:50,904 --> 01:20:54,931
would you be kind enough
to hold them for me?

1390
01:20:54,974 --> 01:20:57,169
-OK.
-sure.

1391
01:20:57,210 --> 01:21:00,270
-How you been, man?
-We missed you.

1392
01:21:00,313 --> 01:21:01,871
Smelly.

1393
01:21:01,915 --> 01:21:04,213
OK. ln case
you've been wondering...

1394
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:07,014
we have been kicking
some serious ass...

1395
01:21:07,053 --> 01:21:09,283
on the homeostasis front.

1396
01:21:09,322 --> 01:21:11,790
This place
is almost back to normal.

1397
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:14,919
So what are the coconuts for--
pina coladas?

1398
01:21:14,961 --> 01:21:17,725
l'm rigging
some pyrotechnics...

1399
01:21:17,764 --> 01:21:20,232
for the door-opening ceremony
tomorrow...

1400
01:21:20,266 --> 01:21:22,257
which l feel is essential...

1401
01:21:22,302 --> 01:21:24,668
for the culmination
of this whole process.

1402
01:21:29,275 --> 01:21:33,268
Give me that thing.
Yes. Yes.

1403
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:44,222
l don't think he liked the way
you play with his coconuts.

1404
01:21:44,257 --> 01:21:47,886
When the doors open,
l don't anticipate any problems.

1405
01:21:47,927 --> 01:21:49,986
Just let them come out.

1406
01:21:51,331 --> 01:21:55,791
lsn't it amazing how clear
everything gets sometimes?

1407
01:21:55,835 --> 01:21:58,303
Haven't you felt that
in the moment...

1408
01:21:58,338 --> 01:22:01,307
when everything
is proportionately correct?

1409
01:22:01,341 --> 01:22:03,206
That's how l am now.

1410
01:22:03,243 --> 01:22:06,440
Anyway, boys,
keep your eye on the clock.

1411
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:10,415
When it hits zero,
you will like what you see.

1412
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:11,644
Adieu!

1413
01:22:13,753 --> 01:22:16,813
And off he goes.

1414
01:22:16,856 --> 01:22:18,483
lnto the wild blue.

1415
01:22:18,525 --> 01:22:21,494
-Come on.
-OK.

1416
01:22:21,528 --> 01:22:23,018
Hey, wait a minute.

1417
01:22:24,697 --> 01:22:27,325
Cluster. Coconut.

1418
01:22:27,367 --> 01:22:30,336
Hey, you know,
he's not such a bad guy.

1419
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:31,837
For a grizzly guy.

1420
01:22:31,871 --> 01:22:33,532
l mean,
he's just a little...

1421
01:22:33,573 --> 01:22:36,838
He's misunderstood.

1422
01:22:36,876 --> 01:22:39,140
Exactly.

1423
01:22:39,179 --> 01:22:41,238
You know what?
We bring out the best in people.

1424
01:22:41,281 --> 01:22:44,216
And people bring out
the best in us, too, Doyle.

1425
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,081
Look at us right now.

1426
01:22:46,119 --> 01:22:47,609
l mean,
who'd have ever thought...

1427
01:22:47,654 --> 01:22:50,122
Look! Right?

1428
01:22:50,156 --> 01:22:51,350
Here. Go long.

1429
01:22:53,226 --> 01:22:56,559
-Stubby going long!
-Keep going!

1430
01:22:56,596 --> 01:22:58,359
l got it! l got it!

1431
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:11,904
You OK, Stub?

1432
01:23:19,018 --> 01:23:22,078
That was no ordinary coconut.

1433
01:23:22,121 --> 01:23:24,316
We rigged
tons of those things, Squirl.

1434
01:23:24,357 --> 01:23:26,484
They could level this place!

1435
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:28,651
Let us out of here!

1436
01:23:28,695 --> 01:23:30,663
There's a bomb in here!

1437
01:23:30,697 --> 01:23:32,358
Hey, what's going on?

1438
01:23:34,467 --> 01:23:35,866
Don't worry.

1439
01:23:39,005 --> 01:23:40,836
You can't do that.

1440
01:23:40,874 --> 01:23:42,535
This costs
two thousand dollars a sheet!

1441
01:23:44,277 --> 01:23:47,337
-Damn bionic glass!
-What are we going to do?

1442
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:49,371
We got to stop
that mother Faulkner!

1443
01:23:53,386 --> 01:23:56,719
You guys, come back!
lt's too dangerous back there!

1444
01:24:00,393 --> 01:24:02,861
My creation!

1445
01:24:02,896 --> 01:24:05,558
l know thee not.

1446
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:10,358
But go gently...

1447
01:24:10,403 --> 01:24:12,564
into the maelstrom.

1448
01:24:12,605 --> 01:24:13,799
Freeze!

1449
01:24:15,608 --> 01:24:19,135
Roshambo for the Dome, doc?
You feel lucky?

1450
01:24:19,178 --> 01:24:22,477
Well, yeah. l think l do.

1451
01:24:22,515 --> 01:24:24,813
On three--one, two, three.

1452
01:24:26,986 --> 01:24:28,544
Paper?

1453
01:24:28,588 --> 01:24:30,453
Don't feel bad.

1454
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:32,219
l would have done it anyway.

1455
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:36,224
Give me the detonator.

1456
01:24:36,262 --> 01:24:38,230
What is the magic word?

1457
01:24:46,272 --> 01:24:49,298
There has to be a magic word.

1458
01:24:49,342 --> 01:24:51,003
The magic word's on three.

1459
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:52,306
Three!

1460
01:24:55,081 --> 01:24:56,878
You cut him off
through the tunnel.

1461
01:24:56,916 --> 01:24:58,679
l'm going to go get
his maelstrom.

1462
01:25:06,492 --> 01:25:08,926
l got you now, Faulkner!

1463
01:25:08,962 --> 01:25:11,556
Come on, baby!
l'm coming for you!

1464
01:25:16,336 --> 01:25:17,803
Wheels!

1465
01:25:17,837 --> 01:25:19,805
So that's how that rat's
been getting around!

1466
01:25:32,652 --> 01:25:34,517
When l get you, l'm going to--

1467
01:25:45,565 --> 01:25:47,396
Slow down.

1468
01:26:02,715 --> 01:26:05,343
-l'm going back in.
-l'll go with you.

1469
01:26:05,385 --> 01:26:06,682
l'm going--

1470
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:09,051
to worry about you guys
while you're in there.

1471
01:26:09,088 --> 01:26:10,578
Just kidding! l'm coming!

1472
01:26:10,623 --> 01:26:13,592
When l see you, l'm going to--
l'm going to--

1473
01:26:13,626 --> 01:26:16,220
Will you finish
a complete thought?

1474
01:26:20,867 --> 01:26:23,267
l got it. l got it!

1475
01:26:24,570 --> 01:26:25,901
You idiot!

1476
01:26:38,685 --> 01:26:40,380
Hang on, Squirl!

1477
01:26:47,727 --> 01:26:50,753
-Get him, Squirl!
-Can't turn it off!

1478
01:26:52,565 --> 01:26:54,897
You're choking me!

1479
01:26:54,934 --> 01:26:57,801
-Give it--
-No!

1480
01:26:57,837 --> 01:26:59,327
-Give me the detonator!
-No!

1481
01:26:59,372 --> 01:27:01,306
l'm coming, Squirl!

1482
01:27:03,843 --> 01:27:06,175
Assume the position!

1483
01:27:11,884 --> 01:27:13,441
Warning--detonation in five...

1484
01:27:13,441 --> 01:27:14,499
Warning--detonation in five...

1485
01:27:14,542 --> 01:27:17,511
four, three...

1486
01:27:17,545 --> 01:27:19,513
two, one.

1487
01:27:19,547 --> 01:27:21,947
Destruct sequence deactivated.

1488
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:26,284
Homeostasis restored to 100%.

1489
01:27:26,321 --> 01:27:28,789
-Happy Earth Day.
-What's happening?

1490
01:27:32,794 --> 01:27:34,625
We did it!

1491
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,461
Oh, my God.

1492
01:27:41,836 --> 01:27:44,304
That was the stupidest thing
we've ever done.

1493
01:27:44,339 --> 01:27:47,706
You're right, but sometimes
stupid can be pretty cool.

1494
01:27:50,645 --> 01:27:51,976
Hey, we did it!
We stopped Faulkner!

1495
01:27:52,013 --> 01:27:54,277
We saved the dome!

1496
01:27:59,754 --> 01:28:02,188
l love you.

1497
01:28:02,223 --> 01:28:05,659
God, Romulus,
easy with the tongue action.

1498
01:28:41,329 --> 01:28:44,230
Poor folks. They must be toast.

1499
01:28:44,265 --> 01:28:45,459
Remember your training.

1500
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:03,674
Where's Faulkner?
Let's go arrest him !

1501
01:29:03,718 --> 01:29:06,778
l really underestimated
you fellows.

1502
01:29:06,821 --> 01:29:09,654
lnterested in a permanent job
at Bio-Dome? Big bucks.

1503
01:29:20,668 --> 01:29:22,659
You guys are my heroes.

1504
01:29:28,776 --> 01:29:30,471
Bye, Bud. We'll miss you.

1505
01:29:30,512 --> 01:29:32,742
Well, Petri dish,
what can l say?

1506
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:34,077
How about good-bye?

1507
01:29:34,115 --> 01:29:36,845
You can save the world
from your couch.

1508
01:29:38,086 --> 01:29:39,917
l'm so proud of you, Doyle.

1509
01:29:39,954 --> 01:29:42,354
-l'm proud of me, too.
-You should be.

1510
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:44,290
l love you!

1511
01:29:47,095 --> 01:29:49,928
We definitely learned
a few things, that's for sure.

1512
01:29:49,964 --> 01:29:52,194
For one, we definitely
have to listen to--

1513
01:29:52,233 --> 01:29:53,700
Your girlfriends?

1514
01:29:53,735 --> 01:29:56,863
Yes, but most importantly,
Mother Nature.

1515
01:29:58,139 --> 01:29:59,834
What's wrong, sweetie?

1516
01:29:59,874 --> 01:30:03,037
l think Mother Nature's
calling me again right now.

1517
01:30:03,077 --> 01:30:05,272
-Can you cork it?
-Negatory.

1518
01:30:05,313 --> 01:30:07,679
There's no place to go
out here.

1519
01:30:07,715 --> 01:30:09,945
Hey, what about that factory?

1520
01:30:09,984 --> 01:30:11,611
l don't think so, Bud.

1521
01:30:11,653 --> 01:30:14,929
Trust me, OK?
We're celebrities.

1522
01:30:17,765 --> 01:30:20,097
Car, drive up!

1523
01:30:26,074 --> 01:30:28,042
Any of you guys seen Faulkner?

1524
01:30:28,076 --> 01:30:30,044
No sign of him over here.

1525
01:30:30,078 --> 01:30:31,443
How could he have gotten out?

1526
01:30:31,479 --> 01:30:32,639
He's not here.
l don't see him.

1527
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:37,014
-Check over in the lagoon.
-He's not here.

1528
01:30:37,051 --> 01:30:39,076
Hey! He must have gotten
through the back door!

1529
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,382
Where'd he get the key?

1530
01:30:41,382 --> 01:30:51,382
