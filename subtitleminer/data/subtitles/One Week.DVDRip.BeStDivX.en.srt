Are you sure ...
he had made a mistake?

21
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,760
You know, I feel good.

22
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,860
Sure.

23
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,600
So, What are we talking about?

24
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,450
You have a way of
extremely aggressive cancer.

25
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,120
You need an aggressive treatment ....

26
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,750
... ¿Cuáles are my options?

27
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,485
Enter a scale of 1-10.

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,625
The survival rate
is about 10%.

29
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,700
Die?

30
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,100
When it comes to people
launched the odds.

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,555
In some cases, a
complete recovery is unprecedented.

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,360
And if the treatments do not
work, how long do I have?

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
A couple of years.

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
At least?

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,580
So, What is the minimum?

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
There ......

37
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,855
...- Are you good, son?
- Yes

38

Yes, I'm fine, thanks.

They are the bike?

Yes, but I am a few years ago.

41

No, thanks. I

00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,655
Perhaps one of the things
who are committed ...

314
00:26:41,755 --> 00:26:45,900
... is, in fact, one of
things I like most about me.

315
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,400
No hay muy importante, de verdad.

316
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,260
This is great. Then
maybe just a small example.

317
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
Well.

318
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,965
I do not want to smell your feet.

319
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,050
But ...
I am not smelly feet.

320
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,800
This is a ridiculous conversation.
Forget what I said.

321
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,900
It is ridiculous, because you said that
my feet do not stink when it smells.

322
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,005
Well, maybe
olfactory also a problem.

323
00:27:14,105 --> 00:27:17,000
I never said that before
I knew that might react badly ....

324
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,150
... Why does not exist.

325
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Believe me, that stink.

326
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,810
You can pay on it.

327
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,900
In fact, I ......

328
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,600
... need to ask a favor.

329
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,700
Well ....

330
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:45,450
... ¿Me could say whether the
my shoes smell bad ...

331
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,530
¿Perdón ...?

332
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,505
I know it sounds absurd, but
is very important to me.

333
00:27:49,605 --> 00:27:53,685
Help yourself
to be brutally honest.

334
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,850
Well, in my professional opinion ......

335
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,950
... no problems.

336
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,650
Ben <i> is questioned
on the real objective </ i> ...

337
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:27,550
<i> hostility Samantha ...
the alleged problem of the foot </ i >....

338
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,900
<i> ... The most important consideration: </ i> ...

339
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,845
<i> ... Why not ask
to which he did not like her? </ I> ...

340
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,250
... You are the north?

341
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,350
Am ...

342
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
¿Adónde you ...?

343
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,250
A west.

344
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,000
Somewhere in the west, in particular?

345
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,450
Not yet.

346
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,830
So the direction, but not ......

347
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
... destination.

348
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,750
Yes, it is more or less ....

349
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:33,000
... ¿Sabías that marijuana is medically
approved for cancer patients ...

350
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,355
¿Eres ... a kind of guess?

351
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,000
No.

352
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,820
So you, because in cancer?

353
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:45,705
Breathe wrapped
with it the right time.

354
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,095
He has had treatment?

355
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,945
In fact,
disappeared by itself ....

356
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,100
Zen ... Really?

357
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,950
No, I'm just stick with me, man.

358
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,050
I had treatment.

359
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,050
You married?

360
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Compromised ....

361
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,850
ZY you ...?
Spouse?

362
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
25 years ago.

363
00:30:20,350 ---> 00:30:21,750
And counting ....

364
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,700
Zen ... Really? There were some
4 years old when she married?

365
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Was 17, actually.

366
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,950
Still in love?

367
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yes ..

368
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,620
... How I knew was the real thing?

369
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,580
If you have to ask ......

370
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,700
... you're not.

371
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
And you already knew that.

372
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
THE HOLY BIBLE

00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,000
... ¿Otra time?

386
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,100
Yes, again.

387
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,450
Grab your breast so funny?

388
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,950
Yes ..

and sinuses are not the clothes?

390
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Come home.

391
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Please.

392
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,495
I'm not ready yet, Sam ....

00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,455
Well, I just joined
in the ring to escape the heat e. ..

395
00:37:26,555 --> 00:37:28,840
E. .. What?

396
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,555
Well, I thought it was
have a heatstroke.

397
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:33,800
I mean, not thinking
was the real Stanley Cup.

398
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,300
Is the real Stanley Cup, ¿verdad?

399
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,550
Yes, of course it is ....

400
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,650
... What are you doing here?

401
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,800
It is the day of Vincent and Derek is in
Manitoba since Anaheim won the cup ....

404

405

Derek Vincent ...- You?

406

Congratulations, man.

Thanks ....

408
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,550
... ¿Dónde is the kind of publicity?

409
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,700
You know, the kind of white gloves
the guard with his life.

410
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,850
In fact, I asked a few
my friends to distraction.

411
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:13,050
To be a moment
only with the cup, ¿sabes?

<b> I could never endure, ¿verdad? </ B>

413

I left halfway through the game with
a concussion, so ...

414
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,795
Yes,
I remember that fight.

415
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,745
Everyone remembers
this fight, except for me ....

00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,850
You want to kiss the cup?

423
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,950
Give luck.

424
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,900

Most people
unrelated, ¿entiendes?

Simply went ahead.

It was not anything else, really.

457
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
Sorry about your dog.

458

Combined.

This is the first time in ten years cries.

462
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,460
You appear to have dirty gasoline.

463
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,100
This is serious?

464
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,200
No.

465
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,650
I just have to clean.
You should not take long.

466
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,250
I never expected to complete two
often divorced ...

467
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:11,750
... and only see my son
once a year if lucky.

468
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,850
He lives with his father?

469
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,900
Has only 20 years.

470
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,805
Anyway, her father
long before it dropped.

Come on, not
has a son aged 20.

472

If.

473
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:28,955
And a granddaughter just made 4.

474
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,900
Only saw once.

475
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,955
My son works in Fort McMurray.

476
00:45:36,055 --> 00:45:39,900
The money is too good
understand here ....

477
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,200
ZY ... why not let you go?

478
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,800
Do something else.

479
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,900
I am also indebted.

480
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,750
And if the weather and the markets
no freaking arm ...

481
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:53,500
... maybe you can adjust the payment of
my loans at the end of the harvest.

482
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,600
I feel a fool if
all the farmers around here ...

483
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,760
... not in the same situation.

484
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,900
That makes you bitter?

485
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:06,950
That's the thing, no.

486
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,750
The earth has a way of
Scratching the skin ...

487
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:20,820
However, if you could give a shit
Every so often, it would be much happier.

488
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,200
Not a bad light, but as
my men are XXL.

489
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,620
Moreover, when normally the progress ...

490
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,375
implies some conditioners ...
air to the wine ...

491
00:46:28,475 --> 00:46:31,280
... and a total lack of subtlety.

492
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,200
Well, let's around a horse.

493
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,295
You know, I really ...
never rode on horseback.

494
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:44,250
Obviously you never lived.

495
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,605
When I come here I think
where else I want to go ....

631
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:42,455
Ben had never <i>
made a complete inventory </ i> ...

632
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:46,720
<i> of things ...
Samantha did not like to </ i >....

634
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,450
<i> ... Everything had to be

635
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:55,834
<i> ... A deviation from this, directed ...

636

637
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:02,850

641
01:01:09,305 --> 01:01:11,155
<i> ... A big disappointment for Ben, </ i> ...

642
01:01:11,255 --> 01:01:16,500
<i> ... because that is the filter
classified many parts of your life </ i>.

643
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,705
Ben <i> regretted the

650
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,650
... Come on, I say to my friends

651
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,800
I remember them ...

652
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:53,600
... Come on, I say to my friends

653
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:58,700
I remember them

654
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,460
You have a fantastic voice.

655
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,000
It's nice of you to say
but there is much left

656
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,140
I hope she can sing.

657
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:14,400
Well, I have perfect pitch,
and you can definitely sing ....

658
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,710
<i> ... That was horrible! </ I>

659
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,550
My teacher s class 4
I lied ....

660
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,650
ZDE ... do you mean?

661
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,200
It's nothing important.

662
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,550
His second book is about what?

663
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,200
I wrote a second novel ....

664
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,500
... any idea ¿Tienes o. .....

665
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,700
... Oh, no. Rejection
killed my creativity.

666
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:49,755
You know, my grandfather
Thomas Edison quotes for me ...

667
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:52,600
... until they run out like a child.

668
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,400
His favorite line: ...

669
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:58,205
'Many of the failures of life
are people who are unaware ...

670
01:02:58,305 --> 01:03:02,130
... how close
of success when he fell.

671
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,585
Fine, but perseverance,
and then there is only an illusion.

672
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:18,705
I think someone has to fill
the proportion of delirium in the world ....

673
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:26,040
... What would you do if you had one week of life?

674
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,100
Maybe ... only
what I'm doing now.

675
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,220
My mind is not tomorrow o. .....

676
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,200
... in yesterday, or even a
three hours. You are just here ....

677
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,300
... What would you do?

678
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,400
Love ....

679
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,500
... Why?

680
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:07,600
I am just a matter of urgency
more than words.

681
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:39,100
Samantha could <i>
find a flight that evening, </ i> ...

682
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:44,980
<i> ... instead of in the morning
Then, as planned. </ I>

683
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,800
When Ben <i> agree
was deliriously happy </ i >....

684
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,224
<i> ... Maybe it was the fact
that somehow ...

685
01:04:56,324 --> 01:04:58,600
... succeeded in solving
their demons </ i >....

686
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,000
What <i> ... this way much
more sense, </ i> ...

687
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,990
... <i> that treatment </ i >....

688
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:34,680
¿Dónde ... have you been all night? ...

689
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,050
... How you can just forgive me ...

690
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,450
ZNO ... bother you?

691
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,900
Of course I'm upset.

692
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,800
But at least not lied in this regard.

693
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,800
You are completely
lost at this time.

694
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:57,350
So I say to myself
which is not us.

695
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:59,400
Maybe later, I get upset.

696
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,600
But now we have more things to try.

697
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:04,750
As for why not go home.

698
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:06,850
Simply can not.

699
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,100
It's selfish.

700
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,850
Es .. is not ....

701
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:15,150
... Are you being an idiot.
Treatment ....

702
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:17,005
ZTE ... seems there is no hope?

703
01:06:17,105 --> 01:06:19,900
I do not want to be patient.

704
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:22,650
No, it does not make sense.

705
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,091
We have still not out ...

706
01:06:24,191 --> 01:06:26,005
... even the fight? By
course that makes sense.

707
01:06:26,105 --> 01:06:28,105
And if this fight?

708
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,400
And if this is the right thing?

709
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:33,550
I know.

710
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:35,650
Changed everything.

711
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,905
But Why?
What happened? ...

712
01:06:38,005 --> 01:06:39,900
... Why not have
only by the diagnosis.

713
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,100
Because, Samantha, I am watching
a wall that can not overcome.

714
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:49,200
Because I do not know
¿cuáles are good answers ....

715
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,340
so be honest ... What?

716
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,150
Well ....

717
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:01,520
¿Quieres know ... what was the first
What went through my head ...

718
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:04,100
... when the doctor said I had cancer?

719
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,200
The first thing?

720
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,200
Is that I wanted to cancel the marriage.

721
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,800
I absolutely wanted to marry ...

722
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:16,150
... and do not want to return to work,
and do not want to do what it was.

723
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:18,905
This is a normal reaction.
So I wanted to cancel the wedding.

724
01:07:19,005 --> 01:07:21,565
However, Samantha,
it is not cancer,

725
01:07:21,665 --> 01:07:24,400
has to do with life
he built for me.

726
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,400
Why I have so much insurance?

727
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,905
Because I care so much
to be responsible all the time?

728
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:33,555
Because I have to mess with that
tools that we put in our kitchen?

729
01:07:33,655 --> 01:07:37,050
I am becoming like my father.
And no offense to him, love him ...

730
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:41,300
... is a decent man, but this
was never the ambition of my life.

731
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,290
So ¿cuál is the alternative?

732
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:46,300
This!

733
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,400
This is the alternative.

734
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,300
You can simply walk
to travel by bike forever.

735
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,650
At some point,
This leaves you on top.

736
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:56,250
Especially you.

737
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:58,350
I just want time.

738
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:02,605
If you can have every
in this day and make life ...

739
01:08:02,705 --> 01:08:05,400
... then it must be a better choice.

740
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,050
But you should not be killed.

741
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,605
You know that. Allows
go against the odds.

742
01:08:10,705 --> 01:08:14,100
That has allowed us to do this.

743
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,600
This has nothing to do with us.

744
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:21,715
This is the problem, Samantha.
This has to do with me ....

745
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:28,150
... ¿Alguna once loved me?

746
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:34,955
Is not the way it deserved ....

747
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,085
... Why I asked you to marry?

748
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,655
Due to the large part of me wanted ....

749
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:55,240
Why not find ...
a reason for not having done so.

750
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:04,500
I never thought it had been withdrawn.

751
01:09:06,005 --> 01:09:08,300
A security option ....

752
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:13,050
... How they have seen?

753
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,300
Any indecision,
All questions ...

754
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:20,050
They always see us.

755
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:22,550
And do not see you.

756
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,600
I'm an idiot.

757
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:36,750
Samantha ....

758
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:39,825
ZNO ... dare to follow me.

759
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:44,150
Shut up!

760
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:23,050
Hi, Mom.

761
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,750
It has a good point.
Thank you.

762
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:31,850
Enjoy.

763
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:44,450
Sorry.

764
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:48,320
You can help us
to take a picture?

765
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:50,750
Bright.

766
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,100
Thank you very much.

767
01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:04,200
Thanks ....

768
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:07,250
...- Not.
- It's Canadian, Zeh?

769
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:08,800
Am

770
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:14,550
Let me tell you who lives
one of the most beautiful countries in the world.

771
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:19,150
I know.

772
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:27,450
<i> Love them was not an illusion. </ I> ...

773

... ¿Cuál is the divorce rate ...

787
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,400
... 36%.

788
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:26,200
This is not some
very good opportunity.

789
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:29,105
Are better than one in ten.

790
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,900
Well, I guess they are.

791
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:42,065
When it comes to people
free numbers.

792
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,600
You have to.

793
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,700
You have to stop it?

794
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:56,950
I asked a man
walking on the road ....

795
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:59,715
'How you know you love ?'...

796
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:05,490
... He told me 'If you have to ask ......

797
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,600
... you're not. "

798
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,080
You never had to ask
anyone ¿verdad, Sam?

799
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:17,750
No.

800
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,900
Of course not ....

801
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:29,650
... Are you crazy?

802
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:33,450
Yes

803
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:38,300
And not just because of that.

804
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:46,250
Of all the various forms
this can be a bitch.

805
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:50,430
I'm obsessed with a
completely selfish.

806
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:53,935
That everyone thinks she is a woman ...

807
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:57,700
... left her boyfriend because he had cancer.

808
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:03,100
I think not.

809
01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:06,865
I think anyone listening to the files.

810
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:16,555
Sorry for us
this confusion.

811
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,125
Although that is good ....

812
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,600
... How are you feeling?

813
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,400
Patient ...

814
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,200
Its worth the trip?

815
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:46,750
Yes

816
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:50,330
But you took pictures?

817
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:56,195
It's worth a lifetime.

818
01:28:31,150 --> 01:28:34,000
When we have the <i>
rare moments of clarity, </ i> ...

819
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:36,700
<i> those moments ...
that the universe makes sense, </ i> ...

820
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,500
<i> tried desperately to ...
agarrarmo us to them. </ I> ...

821
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,210
<i> ... They are the life rafts
sometimes the darkest, </ i> ...

822
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:43,732
<i> ... in the vastness of everything,

823
01:28:43,832 --> 01:28:46,305
the incomprehensible nature
of life </ i> ...

824
01:28:46,405 --> 01:28:48,900
... <i> escapes us completely. </ I>

825
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,450
So the question becomes,
or should have been: ...

826
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:55,650
... if they knew what
that there was only one day ...

827
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:58,810
... or a week,
or month of life ...

828
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,150
What lifeboat hold ... ...

829
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:04,250
What secret ... ...

830
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:06,600
banda ... What to see?

831
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,720
The person to declare his love?

832
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:12,300
You want to do ...

833
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,740
What exotic place ... went for a coffee?

834
01:29:19,150 --> 01:29:21,150
He wrote that book?

835
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:32,350
ONE WEEK BY BEN TYLER

836
01:29:55,175 --> 01:30:01,675
To strive, to seek,
And I find it will not fail

837
