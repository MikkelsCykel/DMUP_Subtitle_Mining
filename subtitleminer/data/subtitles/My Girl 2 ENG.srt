00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:00,840
I remember before I was born...

2
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:04,319
...wadded up like a fur ball
in the highly overrated foetal position.

3
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,286
Luckily, I'm not claustrophobic...

4
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:09,759
...but on rainy days,
I still feel a tightness in my left shoulder.

5
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:11,521
Now that my stepmother's pregnant...

6
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:13,839
...I understand
what the baby's going through...

7
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:15,487
...and I'm not jealous at all.

8
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,407
Really, not at all.

9
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:20,920
- You're not eating your meatloaf.
- Lf I eat it, I'll throw up.

10
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:24,524
- You should at least try a little bit.
- Then I'll throw up a little bit.

11
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:27,084
Are you sure
you wanna get involved in this?

12
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,279
Try to scrunch these chairs together more.

13
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:29,242
Dad, I'm trying to.
They're chairs. They don't scrunch.

14
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,598
I'll get it.

15
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:32,919
We'll just set up
more chairs in the library...

16
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:35,000
...and pipe the sermon in like once before.

17
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:38,240
Fix that speaker. It makes the minister
sound like an astronaut.

18
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:40,718
- Hello, Judy
- Hi, Arthur.

19
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:43,609
- Hi, Judy. Come on in.
- Hi, Mr. Sultenfuss.

20
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:45,048
Look who I found.

21
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:46,204
Hi, Judy.

22
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:47,518
Hi.

23
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:49,718
Come on in.

24
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,004
That's okay.

25
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:53,117
It's just a corpse.

26
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:54,637
I know that.

27
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,319
You should see a body
that's been dead for a couple of days...

28
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:00,286
...and they haven't found it yet...

29
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:03,401
...'cause it was in an apartment,
and no one came to visit.

30
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:06,207
Or floating in a river.

31
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:09,362
And then the body starts turning
this weird shade of green.

32
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:11,920
You know, like watery pea soup?

33
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:14,439
The arms and legs deteriorate first.

34
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:17,567
The body looks like a raisin
with four fat legs.

35
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:19,038
Anyway.

36
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:22,567
This is why
I'm seriously considering cremation.

37
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,318
Judy?

38
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:27,078
Judy!

39
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:31,966
I think you lost on the raisin
with the four fat legs, honey.

40
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:37,004
<i>Did you hear that, Dean?</i> You can stay.

41
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,117
<i>- Dean?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

42
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,081
<i>Dean Martin. Look at his eyes.</i>

43
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:45,404
<i>- They're pink.</i>
<i>- Exactly. Dean Martin.</i>

44
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:49,439
<i>- The cage is all set.</i>
<i>- Where's the bathroom?</i>

45
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:52,447
<i>Are you kidding?</i>
<i>Hamsters don't go to the bathroom.</i>

46
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:54,202
<i>Did you look in the bag?</i>

47
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:01,368
I got a card from your Uncle Phil
in Los Angeles today.

48
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,041
Said he went body surfing.

49
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,043
I don't know if I can picture
Uncle Phil body surfing.

50
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:07,687
I don't know if I want to.

51
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,444
Vada, I wanna ask you a favour.
You can absolutely say no if you want to.

52
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:17,999
I'm just bringing it up for discussion.

53
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,842
But Harry, I thought we decided
we weren't gonna do this.

54
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:23,278
Do what?

55
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:27,204
The thing is, your room's
right next to ours, and so, we thought...

56
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:29,837
...I thought, we might move you
to Gramoo's room...

57
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:32,124
...and we use your old room
for the nursery.

58
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,677
We're gonna be up half the night
with the newborn...

59
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:35,918
You want me to move?

60
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:38,160
Well, not far. Just down the hall.

61
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:39,967
Plus, Gramoo's room is a lot bigger.

62
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:41,880
And you get a view of the neighbourhood.

63
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:44,966
Okay. No problem.

64
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,486
Okay, thanks. Attagirl.

65
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:57,844
Harry?

66
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:04,717
I'm sorry to interrupt, honey,
but Vada's upset.

67
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,284
She's fine. She'll love her new room.

68
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,198
Look, we react to every kick
this baby gives.

69
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:13,164
Maybe Vada's trying
to tell us something, too.

70
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:18,326
The thing to remember is
you must visualise a spare.

71
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:22,448
The parabola of the arcing ball must
intersect with the pyramid of the pins...

72
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:24,878
...at precisely this angle of attack.

73
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:28,645
Shit.

74
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:32,727
"Visualise" a spare?

75
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:34,767
Well, you know what I mean.

76
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:37,767
So, what's on your mind?

77
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:40,488
Me? What makes you think
there's something on my mind?

78
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:43,403
You're passing up Archie Bunker
to go bowling.

79
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:45,042
You've gotta have an angle.

80
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:46,204
No, I just...

81
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:50,038
...thought it'd be nice if the two of us
had an evening out so we could talk.

82
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:56,281
- Shelly's already told me all about sex.
- She told me, too.

83
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:59,008
I mean, she told me
she told you about sex.

84
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:02,642
I personally knew about sex
long before I met Shelly.

85
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:04,248
I figured you did.

86
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,119
Yes.

87
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:20,204
Strike. Not bad at all.

88
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:24,561
No, this talk isn't about sex.

89
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:28,924
There've been a lot of changes,
and you're upset about losing your room...

90
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:30,926
...but the baby's gotta go somewhere.

91
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:33,847
No, it's okay. I understand. Really.

92
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:36,405
Honey, that's very mature.

93
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:39,241
I'm proud of you, Vada.

94
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,567
Maybe I should move to China.

95
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:48,802
One kid per family.
That way you don't lose your room.

96
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,121
Just keep your room,
and we'll put the baby in the backyard.

97
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:54,359
Don't do that.
We've got the whole garage.

98
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:57,129
Right between the power mower
and the weedkiller.

99
00:06:57,729 --> 00:06:58,957
Dad, I'm kidding.

100
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:00,648
You can have the room.

101
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:03,081
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

102
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:04,998
Great.

103
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:06,878
I'm 13.

104
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:09,924
Maybe it's about time
I got my own apartment.

105
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:16,685
- My mother can't have any more kids.
- Neither can mine.

106
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:18,563
She's dead.

107
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,082
It's Shelly who's pregnant.

108
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:22,683
What do you think?

109
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:26,959
I'm leaning towards "Passion Flower."

110
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:30,758
"It combines the traditional floral scent
with the musky aroma of sandalwood."

111
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:34,602
- What are you staring at?
- It's Kevin.

112
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:37,242
I don't want him to see me.

113
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:41,363
- See you? He can smell you from there.
- Oh, God, he's coming over here.

114
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,844
Act natural, totally natural.

115
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:49,606
- Hi, Kevin.
- Hi.

116
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:54,368
You look cool, Sultenfuss.
You look like a grasshopper.

117
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,925
- What's the matter?
- He likes you.

118
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:06,568
Likes me?
He said I look like a grasshopper.

119
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:09,363
Boys always pretend they hate you
when they like you.

120
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:10,643
That's ridiculous.

121
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:12,720
So, if you really can't stand someone...

122
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:15,482
...then you pretend
that you're really crazy about them?

123
00:08:15,609 --> 00:08:16,644
I don't know.

124
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,966
And I don't care. Kevin's a jerk,
and I don't like him anymore.

125
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:21,448
He's all yours.

126
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:25,879
<i>If "grasshopper" is a term of endearment,</i>
<i>I've got a lot to learn.</i>

127
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:30,808
So, have you guys thought
of any new names for the baby?

128
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:36,122
Yeah. If it's a girl,
I'm kind of leaning toward Esme.

129
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:37,198
Esme?

130
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,486
Yeah, that kinda sounds like a noise
your nose makes.

131
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:42,088
"Esme." I mean it's...

132
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:44,968
- And what if it's a boy?
- Well, Harry Jr., of course.

133
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:48,561
When a boy likes you,
does he pretend that he doesn't like you?

134
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:51,641
If he pretends not to like you,
how do you tell he likes you?

135
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:53,447
What boy likes you?

136
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:56,124
It's just a question. It's not about anybody.

137
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:57,528
Here comes puberty.

138
00:08:57,609 --> 00:09:00,806
Vada, I think what you're talking about
is the fear of rejection.

139
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:03,523
See, men will do anything
to avoid looking foolish.

140
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:06,527
Shell, that's ridiculous.
Where are my needlenose pliers?

141
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:09,084
If a boy wants to do homework with you...

142
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:11,558
...it means he hasn't the nerve
to ask you on a date.

143
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:14,607
You get your homework together,
and the next thing you know...

144
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:18,204
...you're ordering pizza and talking about
your favourite movie stars.

145
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:20,240
So, you're saying...

146
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:22,681
What are you saying?

147
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:28,806
Guys don't wanna appear overanxious.

148
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:32,245
If there's a boy that might like you,
let him know that you like him...

149
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:36,408
...so he won't feel he's taking such a risk
when he's thinking of asking you out.

150
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:38,278
Okay?

151
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:18,562
- Hi.
- Hi.

152
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:21,927
Wanna help me pick out wallpaper
for my new room tomorrow?

153
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,603
- I don't know, I mean...
- Is it okay if I drink this?

154
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:27,565
It's okay with me. Hi, Kevin.

155
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:30,563
Well, if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.

156
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:32,403
Stop it, Kevin.

157
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:34,400
I was kidding. It's a joke, okay?

158
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:36,648
We were just doing our homework.

159
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:39,318
Next thing you know,
you'll be ordering pizza...

160
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:41,718
...and talking about
your favourite movie stars.

161
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:42,605
See you.

162
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:03,002
<i>In the future, I think I'll stick</i>
<i>to asking Dad for advice on embalming.</i>

163
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:42,361
I read an article that says...

164
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:44,963
...if you sing to the baby
it's a calming influence.

165
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:46,926
Assuming the baby's a Supremes fan.

166
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:50,565
- I bet your mum sang to you.
- Lf there was an article about it, she did.

167
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:53,959
- She was always reading.
- I know. It runs in the family. New book?

168
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:56,279
<i>The Collected Works of Alfred Beidermeyer.</i>

169
00:11:56,369 --> 00:11:57,768
Her favourite poet.

170
00:11:58,409 --> 00:11:59,558
Never heard of him.

171
00:12:00,849 --> 00:12:01,964
Excuse me.

172
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:06,680
- How about a nice glass of milk?
- With taco chips so I can dunk.

173
00:12:11,369 --> 00:12:12,358
You know, Vada...

174
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:16,203
...being an older sister, you're gonna be
very important in this baby's life.

175
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:23,407
They're enormous, I know.

176
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:27,008
Is there milk in them already?

177
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:29,319
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.

178
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,562
When did you...

179
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,448
I mean...

180
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:39,125
I was a very late developer.
They used to call me "Shelly-Two-Backs."

181
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:42,641
All my friends had real bras,
not like the training ones I had.

182
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:46,358
Why do they call them training bras?
It's not like learning to ride a bike.

183
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:47,438
I know.

184
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:51,086
It's just sort of preparing you
for the rest of your life.

185
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:52,648
It's not easy being a woman.

186
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:54,283
You're telling me.

187
00:12:56,169 --> 00:12:59,206
<i>All the great writers</i>
<i>ponder the meaning of life and death.</i>

188
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:01,644
<i>I've been thinking a lot about</i>
<i>my mother recently...</i>

189
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:04,163
<i>... even though I don't have</i>
<i>any memories of her.</i>

190
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:07,719
<i>I wish I could see her just once,</i>
<i>even if it were only in a dream.</i>

191
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:10,958
<i>I know she'd help me figure things out.</i>

192
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:15,041
<i>"Bless me now with your fierce tears,</i>
<i>I pray</i>

193
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:18,920
<i>"Do not go gentle into that good night</i>

194
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:24,086
"Rage, rage against the dying of the light"

195
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:27,644
What do you think
Dylan Thomas is saying here?

196
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:30,364
"Rage against the dying of the light"

197
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:33,119
He's mad
'cause they shut off his electricity?

198
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:36,998
He was referring to life energy,
Mr. Phillips...

199
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:40,638
...which, in your case,
wouldn't cause much of a power shortage.

200
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:47,960
The poem is really about attitude.

201
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:50,241
It's about not giving up.

202
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:53,679
It's easy to be
overwhelmed sometimes, but...

203
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:58,001
...that's when we should
force ourselves to push on.

204
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:00,088
Alfred Beidermeyer said:

205
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:02,280
"To heed the urgent inner voice...

206
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:05,320
"...embracing destiny, not choice."

207
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:08,528
That's very good, Vada.

208
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:11,442
All right, moving on.

209
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:15,128
I want to give you guys a chance to write.

210
00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:18,122
Listen up!

211
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:21,406
I want you to write about
someone very special.

212
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:24,767
Someone interesting.
Someone you admire.

213
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:28,446
Someone who's achieved something
worth writing about.

214
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:31,327
But it's gotta be a stranger.
Someone you've never met.

215
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:33,679
I want you to investigate the personal side.

216
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:37,918
Play Perry Mason,
see what you can come up with. All right?

217
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,128
Any ideas?

218
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:45,204
Remember two things:
Someone who has achieved something...

219
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:47,406
...and someone you've never met.

220
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:50,085
- Kevin?
- Elvis, the King.

221
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:52,285
Elvis, the King.

222
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:55,717
- Devin?
- Farrah Fawcett.

223
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:57,720
I love to watch that girl run.

224
00:14:57,809 --> 00:14:59,800
Why is that, Mr. Reed?

225
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:02,402
Never mind.

226
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:06,598
Vada, what about you?
Who have you come up with?

227
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:09,648
My mother.

228
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:13,118
Your mother?

229
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:16,800
I never met my mother.

230
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:24,199
I know my mum's favourite colour
was pink and she ate peanut butter...

231
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:28,407
...and banana sandwiches for breakfast, but
that's not what I would call "hard facts."

232
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:30,839
- I told you about the pumpkin, didn't I?
- No.

233
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:33,318
I bought her this huge pumpkin
for Halloween.

234
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:35,525
She couldn't bear to carve it
so she saved it.

235
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:37,247
It ended up under the Christmas tree.

236
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:40,605
Then Gramoo said on Christmas Eve
there was this sickening smell...

237
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,441
...permeating the entire house.
- No.

238
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:45,999
When I picked it up, it sort of exploded
and liquefied at the same time.

239
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:49,488
It wasn't funny.
It soaked through Gramoo's Oriental.

240
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:51,924
There's still a big spot on the floor.

241
00:15:54,969 --> 00:15:57,847
Okay. We need wallpaper paste.
Hey, Cece.

242
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:00,479
Isn't there anything else you remember?

243
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:03,204
How did you propose? Was it romantic?

244
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:06,966
I kinda just blurted it out
over a root beer float.

245
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,926
Root beer float, that sounds good.

246
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:14,404
Did she mention any contest that she won?
I mean, she must have had some awards.

247
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:16,042
She was so talented and all.

248
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,528
She was talented.

249
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:20,004
Honey, I wish I could help you a little more.

250
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:23,240
It's just that your mother and I
had kind of a whirlwind courtship.

251
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,479
She came to town
with a travelling theatre group.

252
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:28,527
I proposed on our second date,
two weeks later we were married.

253
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:31,442
Almost nine months later,
you were here and she was gone.

254
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:34,327
- Was it a nice funeral?
- Yes. Lovely funeral.

255
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:36,725
Grenaldi Brothers did a beautiful job.

256
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,846
Lots of pink roses,
and I used the white hearse.

257
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:43,086
How about this flowered wallpaper
for your room?

258
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:46,728
How about this?

259
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:53,038
- Hi, Mr. Owett.
- Hey, Veda.

260
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:57,438
- How's your report coming?
- Great.

261
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:00,762
I have so much to say,
I hardly know where to start.

262
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:05,047
I've been rereading Virginia Woolf.
I think she'd be a natural for you.

263
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:07,208
She led a fascinating life.

264
00:17:07,969 --> 00:17:10,244
Thanks, but I think
I'm gonna stick to my mum.

265
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,206
She led a fascinating life, too.

266
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,967
I'm sure she did.

267
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:22,478
He was giving you an easy out so you
didn't have to write about your mother.

268
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,048
But I want to write about her.

269
00:17:24,129 --> 00:17:26,245
You're crazy.
What was her big achievement?

270
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:29,241
- Did she invent gravity?
- No one invented gravity.

271
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:30,924
It just exists.

272
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,203
Then what did she do?

273
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:34,359
Well, I'm not supposed to talk about it...

274
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:37,600
...but since I'm going to write about it,
I might as well tell you.

275
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,486
She was a spy against the Russians.

276
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:42,037
Please. Who do you think you're kidding?

277
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:44,199
And where did she spy
on the Russians from?

278
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:45,517
Here in Pennsylvania?

279
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:47,804
No, not here in Pennsylvania.

280
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:50,808
She went to Russia undercover
with her acting troupe...

281
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:54,279
...and got a lot of highly sensitive
secret plans sent back.

282
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:58,764
Just when she was about to go home,
she got caught and they killed her.

283
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:01,602
So, when did she have you
between all of her acting...

284
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,566
...and spying and getting caught?

285
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,877
That's simple.

286
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,605
She was pregnant with me
when she went to Russia, but didn't know.

287
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:11,329
When the Russians found out,
they waited to shoot her.

288
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:14,481
You're not allowed to kill pregnant women
anywhere in the world.

289
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:16,764
So she had you in jail in Russia?

290
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,646
Well, actually, I was born in Siberia
and then they shot her...

291
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:22,685
...and sent me home to my dad.

292
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:26,205
If bullshit wore a bra, you'd be top-heavy.

293
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:27,598
Come on, Judy.

294
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:31,845
Ask anyone. Ask my dad.

295
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,167
It could be true.

296
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:47,362
<i>How come guys talk so much</i>
<i>when they have nothing to say...</i>

297
00:18:47,449 --> 00:18:50,043
<i>... and girls have plenty to say,</i>
<i>but no one'll listen?</i>

298
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,759
I used to come down here
and sleep on this spot when I was little.

299
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:06,679
My report's gonna be a disaster.

300
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:09,842
Everything I know about her
fits into one little box.

301
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:11,718
A box?

302
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:18,487
Oh, Vada, what a sweet baby book!

303
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:23,238
It's only filled out to page two.

304
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:28,198
I was eight pounds, four ounces.

305
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:29,927
There are so many programmes.

306
00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:31,887
She was in a lot of plays.

307
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:35,125
Dad said that when she was on stage...

308
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:37,883
...she held the audience
in the palm of her hand.

309
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:42,686
What's this? "December 8, 1958."

310
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:45,519
I don't know. Dad doesn't either.

311
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:48,005
Well, it must mean something.

312
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:50,326
She was obviously very sentimental.

313
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:53,763
This, that's one of my favourite things,
her passport.

314
00:19:56,049 --> 00:19:58,040
Vada, she's so beautiful.

315
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:04,085
"Margaret Ann Muldovan,
born in Los Angeles, California...

316
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,047
"...February 7, 1936." Aquarius.

317
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:10,446
Margaret's my middle name,
but everybody called her Maggie.

318
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:13,722
- Los Angeles. Have you ever been there?
- No.

319
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:17,402
You know, they say that it never rains...

320
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:20,602
...that you can barbecue on Christmas Day.

321
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:25,045
Instead of riding your bike,
you just surf over to your friend's house.

322
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:27,279
The place is just crawling with celebrities.

323
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:30,679
I know someone who saw Walter Matthau
picking up his dry cleaning.

324
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:32,725
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?

325
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:35,085
Uncle Phil just needed a change.

326
00:20:35,449 --> 00:20:37,167
A little adventure.

327
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:41,167
I wonder why she got a passport
if she never went anywhere?

328
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:42,921
Well, you've gotta be prepared.

329
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:45,206
I'm definitely travelling some day.

330
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:48,368
Why not now?

331
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:50,603
What do you mean?

332
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:54,081
How would you like to visit
your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...

333
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:58,606
...next week, during your spring vacation?
You could do research on your mum.

334
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,204
But what about you and the baby?
You need me.

335
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:04,960
But I'm not due to have the baby
for another six weeks or so.

336
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:08,365
It would be kind of great.

337
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:10,280
It would be fantastic!

338
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:13,006
But Dad will never go for it.

339
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:15,926
You leave your father to me.

340
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:18,204
You should encourage her
to spread her wings.

341
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:20,484
She can spread her wings
here in Pennsylvania.

342
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:22,287
You don't send a child to Los Angeles.

343
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:25,088
She could come back with her ears pierced
and legs shaved.

344
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:27,205
She's not a child. She's a young woman.

345
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:29,007
- She's on the brink of...
- Disaster.

346
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:32,399
- Disaster lurks behind every palm tree.
- You're being narrow-minded.

347
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:35,720
Maybe when she's a little older,
I'd be more than happy to bring...

348
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:37,845
Hi, Vada. We were just having a little...

349
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:39,880
You were just having a fight about me.

350
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:41,880
Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?

351
00:21:42,889 --> 00:21:43,878
Of course.

352
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,529
I think that if I'm old enough
to accept a new baby...

353
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,679
...and old enough to accept a new room...

354
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:50,248
...I'm old enough for California.

355
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:52,718
I know it's fun to think about these things,
but...

356
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:54,162
I already bought a ticket.

357
00:21:54,249 --> 00:21:57,559
- What?
- I used my money and got a great deal.

358
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,958
It's a Q47-NR five-day fare...

359
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:03,644
...which means I'll change planes
in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.

360
00:22:03,729 --> 00:22:06,801
There's no exchanges or refunds,
so if you don't let me go...

361
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:09,807
...then I will have wasted
my entire life savings.

362
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:17,966
Isn't it against the law
to sell airline tickets to minors?

363
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:24,042
Don't tell me you aided and abetted
this little scheme?

364
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:25,642
Vada needed me.

365
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:28,284
The airline requires
the signature of an adult.

366
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:31,281
They forgot to ask for one
who wasn't having hormone surges.

367
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:35,123
Come on, Harry!
We're talking about five days here.

368
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:38,121
We're going overboard
for just a simple school assignment.

369
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:40,165
<i>It's not a little school assignment.</i>

370
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:42,809
<i>I think maybe all of this</i>
<i>is happening for a reason.</i>

371
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:44,921
<i>Reason? What reason? What?</i>

372
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:49,048
<i>Phil's moving to LA, Gramoo's passing.</i>
<i>The baby being born.</i>

373
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:50,722
<i>Vada's report.</i>

374
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:55,803
Maybe all of these are signs. Signs that
it's time for Vada to take this trip.

375
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:57,758
Signs?

376
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:01,124
Let me get the Loch Ness Monster
on the phone.

377
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:02,961
You two have a lot to talk about.

378
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,483
No, I'm sorry.
Vada is not going to Los Angeles.

379
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:08,402
Now, I have made my decision,
and that is final.

380
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:10,366
And remember, don't talk to anyone.

381
00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:12,963
Even if a nun sits next to you,
don't talk to her.

382
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:14,368
No nuns. Got it.

383
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:16,445
And no boys. Promise me.

384
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:20,279
Those LA people are all so corrupt,
you'll end up pregnant and on drugs.

385
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:23,167
Don't run to me when you're in the morgue
with a toe tag...

386
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:26,161
...having been beaten to
an unrecognisable pulp by a surfer.

387
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:27,762
And don't make eye contact.

388
00:23:27,969 --> 00:23:30,563
It communicates an implied vulnerability.

389
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:32,002
What does that mean?

390
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:35,167
It means I'm a paranoid nitwit
who's never let his baby girl...

391
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:38,286
...out of his sight for the simple reason
he's a paranoid nitwit.

392
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:42,444
So, why don't you just say, "Oh, Dad,"
and get on the damn plane already.

393
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:44,520
'Bye, Dad. I'll miss you.

394
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:48,520
Thanks. I needed that.

395
00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:53,004
I'll be back in 137 hours.

396
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:55,883
Have fun!

397
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:03,642
Not too much.

398
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:24,803
<i>It's hard to believe that</i>
<i>my mother's whole life fits into this box.</i>

399
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:29,202
<i>I've just got to think of this stuff as clues.</i>
<i>Or good-luck charms.</i>

400
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:32,679
<i>But I need more than luck</i>
<i>to solve this puzzle.</i>

401
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:34,637
<i>I need a miracle.</i>

402
00:24:57,889 --> 00:25:01,928
<i>Arriving passengers, Flight 57,</i>
<i>your baggage is now available...</i>

403
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:03,601
<i>... on Carousel 2.</i>

404
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:16,962
<i>Arriving passengers</i>
<i>please go to ticket agent...</i>

405
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,324
<i>... at the airline's reservation counter.</i>

406
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,159
Are you waiting for someone?

407
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:49,161
Excuse me, I asked you a question.

408
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:52,082
I'm not suppose to talk to strangers,
not even nuns.

409
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:53,887
You're Vada, right?

410
00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:57,643
- How did you know my name?
- Your Uncle Phil told me.

411
00:25:57,729 --> 00:25:59,481
Where is he?
He was supposed to meet me.

412
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:02,561
Hey, relax!
You think I kidnapped him or something?

413
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:04,885
This is California. Anything's possible.

414
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:08,605
Well, if I was looking for a victim,
I wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil...

415
00:26:08,689 --> 00:26:11,328
...who outweighs me by about 150 pounds.

416
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:14,765
Besides, who would I ask for ransom?
You?

417
00:26:15,249 --> 00:26:19,037
Are you suffering from a chemical
imbalance or is it just an attitude problem?

418
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:22,485
My only problem is that your uncle's
given me $5 to pick you up...

419
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:24,605
...but I don't get paid till delivery.

420
00:26:24,689 --> 00:26:26,407
Gee, that is a problem.

421
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:31,600
Put that down! I'll call the police!

422
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:36,283
What are you gonna do? Tell them that
a polite person helped carry your bag?

423
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:37,878
You're not very polite.

424
00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:42,485
I don't think you're very grateful.
A lot of people would say thank you.

425
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,560
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

426
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:50,764
- I don't even know your name.
- It's Nick. There you go.

427
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:54,680
- Okay.
- Thanks.

428
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,201
Oh, great! No cabs.

429
00:26:58,289 --> 00:26:59,517
I have a gift for you.

430
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:01,486
- Thanks.
- No, thanks.

431
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:04,728
- He said it was a gift.
- Yeah, right.

432
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:07,687
- Look, I don't need you to be telling me to...
- Taxi!

433
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:09,678
Get in. Get in!

434
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:16,207
You look like you know where to go.
Where are we headed?

435
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:19,599
Take the 405 to Santa Monica,
then to Whittier to Sunset.

436
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:34,728
Here you go. See that building?

437
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:38,843
My grandfather built it.
Budapest Auto Repair.

438
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:42,044
That's my room, right up there.

439
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:45,727
One of these days,
this is all gonna be mine.

440
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:51,282
Uncle Phil!

441
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:53,684
Vada!

442
00:28:55,489 --> 00:28:56,922
Look at you!

443
00:28:57,049 --> 00:29:00,280
Hi! Hi, honey! How are you?

444
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,640
- You look great! How's Shelly? Your dad?
- They're great.

445
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:05,924
How about Nick?
Did he take good care of you?

446
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:08,603
He was very polite. Worth the entire $5.

447
00:29:09,569 --> 00:29:11,287
Well, good to know.

448
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:14,283
Thanks.

449
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:16,760
Give it back, Nicholas.

450
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:18,846
But we made a business deal!

451
00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:22,246
Whatever happened
to a good-old-fashioned favour?

452
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:25,358
Our family's been dealing
with your company...

453
00:29:25,449 --> 00:29:29,328
...for over 40 years. Either the chain
is here or it isn't, and I don't see it.

454
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:31,320
You wanna come down and explain why...

455
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:33,969
...we can't fix cars 'cause parts aren't here?
Come on.

456
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:36,722
I already have weight trouble.
I don't need your blubber.

457
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:39,801
Are we clear on this,
or do I have to speak with your father?

458
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:42,157
Thank you.

459
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,519
Yes, yes, I love you too, Irving.

460
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:49,680
You must be Vada!

461
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:52,762
Oh, what a face!

462
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:56,965
Oh, if I had a face like that,
I wouldn't have to yell so much.

463
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:01,165
I'm Rose. Rose Zsigmond.
Nick's mother, among other things.

464
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:02,523
You're Nick's mother?

465
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:05,237
Did you think he was raised
by a pack of wolves?

466
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:06,967
Don't be misled by the haircut.

467
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:08,084
Mum!

468
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:11,525
Who knew when I started working
in the finest foreign car shop in LA...

469
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,600
...I'd also find the light of my life?

470
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:15,441
Well, he left out a couple of steps.

471
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:17,281
I've gotta get back to these bills.

472
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:18,848
Will you help Vada get settled?

473
00:30:19,449 --> 00:30:21,804
Come on.
I'll show you where you're gonna stay.

474
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,288
Here we go.

475
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,718
Not what you expected
from downstairs, right?

476
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:32,687
Now, we'll put your stuff
over here in this closet.

477
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:37,601
You can unpack later.

478
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:43,081
This is where you sleep.
Luckily, this sofabed is really comfortable.

479
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:45,524
I can tell you that
from personal experience.

480
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:49,198
Bathroom. You have to?

481
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:52,725
Rose and my room.

482
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:54,567
She lives here, too?

483
00:30:55,249 --> 00:30:58,207
That's right. Like one big happy family.

484
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:01,725
This is Nick's room and...

485
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:04,238
But are you engaged or something?

486
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,206
Dating, seriously dating.

487
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:08,757
You're thirsty.
You want something to drink?

488
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:12,078
Sure you do. It's been a long trip.

489
00:31:14,449 --> 00:31:18,408
You see, Vada, marriage is a very big step.

490
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:24,640
And not something
to be entered into lightly.

491
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:31,080
I just wanna make very sure
that everything is absolutely...

492
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:33,478
...right before I go jumping into some kind...

493
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:36,208
Sounds like you have
a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.

494
00:31:36,689 --> 00:31:39,442
That's ridiculous.
I'm very, what do you call it?

495
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:41,520
- Committed?
- Committed.

496
00:31:42,849 --> 00:31:45,204
So, does that mean
you sleep here every night?

497
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:47,522
Yes, it does.

498
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:51,719
Well, that's not exactly dating, is it?

499
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:57,559
Vada, I know that traditionally, you're not
supposed to do a lot of these things...

500
00:31:57,689 --> 00:31:59,645
...before you're officially married...

501
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:04,842
...but these are very special circumstances.

502
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:09,958
<i>When sex is involved,</i>
<i>it's always "special circumstances."</i>

503
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:15,885
My parents had a brief
but intensely fulfilling relationship.

504
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:18,718
She's remained a woman of mystery
to this day.

505
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:21,279
And you're gonna solve the mystery?

506
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:24,167
I got it all figured out.
She went to Wilson High School...

507
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:27,844
...so first thing tomorrow, I'll go there
and get a copy of her yearbook.

508
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:30,762
That way I get the names
of people she was in clubs with...

509
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,362
...and find out about her friends.

510
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:33,802
Then you'll be all set.

511
00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:37,638
- Sounds like you're very organised.
- I have to be. I only have five days.

512
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:40,399
Just point me in the right direction and...

513
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:43,879
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off
with your own private guide.

514
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:48,718
I'd consider it a personal favour.

515
00:32:54,649 --> 00:32:57,846
It isn't like you had a whole lot
to plan for this week, right?

516
00:32:58,169 --> 00:32:59,397
It'll be okay.

517
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:01,563
Here you go.

518
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:04,319
- What's that?
- $10.

519
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:07,481
- What's it for?
- For the mini-bike fund.

520
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:11,487
I know you're not crazy
about taking Vada around tomorrow...

521
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:14,129
...so I just want you to know
I appreciate it though.

522
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,837
- No problem.
- You're a good man, Nicholas.

523
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:19,318
Phil, I think you should consider...

524
00:34:04,369 --> 00:34:06,678
I thought my mum went to school in LA.

525
00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:09,278
We've gotta be closing in
on the Grand Canyon.

526
00:34:10,689 --> 00:34:12,805
I'm sure for a trip to the Grand Canyon...

527
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:15,847
...you'd charge a little more than $10.

528
00:34:18,049 --> 00:34:21,121
You know,
eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.

529
00:34:21,209 --> 00:34:23,803
I wasn't eavesdropping. I was overhearing.

530
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:27,399
I didn't ask for the money.
Phil just gave it to me.

531
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:31,882
Look, I know that all you care about
is your precious mini-bike.

532
00:34:32,729 --> 00:34:36,438
It's obvious you have no sense of
historical perspective. I think we're here.

533
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,527
Getting off, please!

534
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,439
Excuse me. Pardon. Thank you.
Excuse me.

535
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,288
Where's the school?

536
00:35:10,649 --> 00:35:16,042
"Due to a devastating fire, June 17, 1963,
Wilson High School was closed."

537
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:19,327
I can't believe it!

538
00:35:19,569 --> 00:35:21,685
My mother's high school burned down.

539
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:25,125
They obviously have no sense
of historical perspective either.

540
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:27,797
It's not funny.
I mean, what am I gonna do?

541
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:29,726
Without that yearbook, I'm lost.

542
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:34,523
I can't just walk around looking
for someone with a Wilson High sweater.

543
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:35,678
- Vada.
- What?

544
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:37,168
Calm down.

545
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:40,527
We just have to ask ourselves
where yearbooks come from.

546
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:42,725
I mean, they don't appear out of thin air.

547
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:47,885
Watch these machines, now.

548
00:35:48,969 --> 00:35:53,440
- This is really very nice of you.
- No problem. I had a mother once myself.

549
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:02,526
If it's in here at all,
it's in the back two rows.

550
00:36:03,249 --> 00:36:05,558
- Okay, thank you very much.
- Happy hunting.

551
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:14,598
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting
a nosebleed from the altitude.

552
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:17,163
Just remember the needle in the haystack.

553
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:22,047
I never did understand that story.
Did they find the needle or not?

554
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:25,363
- What difference does it make?
- A big difference.

555
00:36:25,529 --> 00:36:30,080
If they found it, we should keep looking.
If not, we're wasting our time.

556
00:36:30,249 --> 00:36:32,205
Oh, my gosh! Here it is.

557
00:36:37,049 --> 00:36:39,722
Look, here she is.
"Margaret Ann Muldovan.

558
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:42,482
"Newspaper, Literary Magazine,
French Club, Drama Club...

559
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:45,242
"...Glee Club, Girls Basketball
and Swim Team.

560
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:49,807
"With Maggie's combo of good looks and
talent, we'll surely see her name in lights."

561
00:36:49,889 --> 00:36:51,117
She was gonna be famous.

562
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,404
Yearbooks always set you up
for disappointment.

563
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:54,683
I want mine to say:

564
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:57,000
"Nick probably won't amount to much...

565
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:00,559
"...so don't be surprised if you never
hear anything about him again."

566
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:02,438
Can we go?

567
00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:05,168
It smells like someone left
their gym bag in here.

568
00:37:05,249 --> 00:37:09,003
It's the leather bindings.
I love the fragrance of vintage books.

569
00:37:09,449 --> 00:37:11,917
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.

570
00:37:13,209 --> 00:37:15,279
He was on the school paper with my mum.

571
00:37:16,129 --> 00:37:19,565
Great. A full page of Tanakas,
15 with the initial "D."

572
00:37:19,729 --> 00:37:21,367
This is gonna be tough.

573
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:24,566
Don't forget, the girls changed their names
if they got married.

574
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,083
I'll never do that.

575
00:37:26,649 --> 00:37:28,640
- Get married?
- Change my name.

576
00:37:29,529 --> 00:37:31,679
You think the guy should change his name?

577
00:37:31,769 --> 00:37:34,124
I don't think anybody
should change their name.

578
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:36,677
That way you can always find them
when you need them.

579
00:37:36,769 --> 00:37:38,760
What if you don't wanna be found?

580
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:42,122
Why do you argue with everything I say?

581
00:37:58,689 --> 00:38:00,407
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

582
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:03,848
Does someone named
Daryl Tanaka work here?

583
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,524
Hey, Tanaka! You got company!

584
00:38:09,409 --> 00:38:12,799
It's too bad about your mum,
but at least she went peacefully.

585
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:15,609
I've seen a lot of people
go out the hard way.

586
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:17,521
What do you remember about her?

587
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:20,077
Well, we worked
on the school paper together.

588
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:24,282
I remember when the Legion of Decency
declared <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i> unfit.

589
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:27,998
Boy, that Jim Backus! What an actor, huh?
What an actor!

590
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:33,441
She wrote this article about censorship
and the First Amendment.

591
00:38:33,529 --> 00:38:34,962
She was really something.

592
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:38,126
Graduation? Some big-deal congressman
saying Senator McCarthy...

593
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:40,006
...was the greatest American ever.

594
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:43,606
Maggie gets up in front of 500 people,
walks out.

595
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:45,407
Couple of people followed her, too.

596
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,638
Took a lot of guts.

597
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:48,447
Wow, you walked out with my mother?

598
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:52,324
Are you kidding?
My parents would've shot me.

599
00:38:53,409 --> 00:38:55,798
I was the president
of the Young Republicans.

600
00:38:55,889 --> 00:38:58,483
<i>Nisei</i>, second generation. Hall monitor.

601
00:38:58,729 --> 00:39:00,560
I didn't wanna start World War III.

602
00:39:01,129 --> 00:39:03,927
You saved a lot of lives.
You should be very proud.

603
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:08,843
I'm trying to find out
her greatest achievement.

604
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:12,965
She was the first girl
ever suspended for smoking.

605
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:16,403
Suspended from school? My mother?

606
00:39:17,249 --> 00:39:20,241
Everyone was really surprised
when Maggie was turned in.

607
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:22,206
She got kicked out for two weeks.

608
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:24,723
What kinda sleazoid geek
would turn her in?

609
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:27,282
I would do it again!

610
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:28,802
You ratted on my mother?

611
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:31,005
Who are you, Hitler's hall monitor?

612
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,564
Maybe you should join a hippie commune.

613
00:39:33,649 --> 00:39:35,002
Let me tell you something.

614
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:38,161
Sooner or later, it's gonna be your turn
to take out the garbage.

615
00:39:38,449 --> 00:39:40,758
What about giving the other guy a break?

616
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:43,647
What about living in the real world, pal?

617
00:39:44,169 --> 00:39:45,966
<i>Tanaka. Got a minute?</i>

618
00:39:46,249 --> 00:39:48,001
I'll be right there.

619
00:39:55,489 --> 00:39:58,162
I'd be a little more careful
of who I hung around with.

620
00:40:04,009 --> 00:40:05,647
Care for a smoke?

621
00:40:10,209 --> 00:40:14,088
This'll be great in my report.
"My mother was suspended for smoking."

622
00:40:14,169 --> 00:40:16,125
- I think it's cool.
- You would.

623
00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:21,321
You'd rather have a mother
that's a member of the police state?

624
00:40:21,409 --> 00:40:23,240
Rules are made to be broken.

625
00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:26,919
<i>- I want there to be no question...</i>
- Just ask him.

626
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:31,806
<i>... that the President</i>
<i>has nothing to hide in this matter.</i>

627
00:40:45,689 --> 00:40:47,361
- Hello.
- Hi.

628
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:49,087
What can I do for you?

629
00:40:49,689 --> 00:40:51,839
I'm staying at the Chteau and the guy...

630
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:55,638
...who runs the garage there said
that you're the best Jag people in town.

631
00:40:55,929 --> 00:40:58,807
Well, Enrique is great, and we are the best.

632
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:02,121
- Well, then I have come to the right place.
- I guess you have.

633
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:05,885
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.

634
00:41:07,249 --> 00:41:08,398
Rose.

635
00:41:09,609 --> 00:41:12,487
- So, what's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

636
00:41:13,169 --> 00:41:15,319
I mean, with your car?

637
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:19,480
Oh. Oil change.

638
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:22,766
I just drove in from Chicago and...

639
00:41:24,209 --> 00:41:25,198
Nice hair.

640
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:26,608
Excuse me?

641
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:28,961
I was commenting on your hair.

642
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:31,960
Oh, are you a hairdresser?

643
00:41:33,689 --> 00:41:36,203
I'm a paediatric cardiologist.

644
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:43,079
You mean you fix the hearts
of little babies?

645
00:41:43,689 --> 00:41:47,318
Mostly little babies, but not exclusively.

646
00:41:50,129 --> 00:41:53,007
It's all in the hands.
You know, you have nice hands.

647
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:55,205
- You operate?
- Yes, I do.

648
00:41:56,689 --> 00:41:59,328
So, I guess I'll always teach,
you know, because...

649
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:01,718
...it makes a good relief
from the operating room.

650
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:05,484
- I feel I have an obligation to pass along...
- Hi. Phil Sultenfuss. Sorry.

651
00:42:06,569 --> 00:42:09,402
- Some kind of problem here?
- No, there's no problem.

652
00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:11,605
Dr. Helburn just needs
to have his oil changed.

653
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:12,844
I see.

654
00:42:13,129 --> 00:42:16,201
'Cause usually that doesn't require
such a lengthy consultation.

655
00:42:17,089 --> 00:42:19,478
Well, Rose was being very thorough.

656
00:42:19,649 --> 00:42:20,684
Was Rose?

657
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:25,001
Why don't you come in tomorrow morning
at 8:00, when we open?

658
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:26,727
- We'll get started.
- I'll be here.

659
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:28,128
I look forward to it.

660
00:42:28,729 --> 00:42:31,402
I'm sorry. I'll get that for you.
Don't worry.

661
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:32,683
Made it worse.

662
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:35,124
Get that for you in the morning.
Nice wheels.

663
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:36,198
Thanks.

664
00:42:41,209 --> 00:42:42,881
Why was he touching you?

665
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:45,199
He wasn't touching me.
He was just gesturing.

666
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,559
- He was caressing you.
- For God's sake!

667
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:50,038
God? I didn't think
you'd want to invoke God...

668
00:42:50,129 --> 00:42:51,960
...because he saw more than I did.

669
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:56,645
Phil, if you want the rights of a husband,
you'll have to ask me something.

670
00:42:56,729 --> 00:43:00,642
If not, you'll have to get accustomed
to the rights of what you are.

671
00:43:01,729 --> 00:43:03,401
- What's that?
- Right now?

672
00:43:04,609 --> 00:43:07,999
An intimate boarder with mechanical skills.

673
00:43:09,649 --> 00:43:10,684
Hi.

674
00:43:11,409 --> 00:43:13,604
Oh, hi! How's the investigation going?

675
00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:16,364
Just call us the "Dead End Kids."

676
00:43:16,569 --> 00:43:20,039
- May I use the phone, please?
- Oh, yeah, sure. Help yourself.

677
00:43:22,409 --> 00:43:25,207
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding...

678
00:43:26,049 --> 00:43:31,043
A gentleman would choose British
racing green with maybe a tan interior.

679
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:35,886
But when you buy
a red car with a black interior...

680
00:43:36,009 --> 00:43:38,728
...and wire wheels,
you have one thing on your mind...

681
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:42,404
...and I'm too much of a gentleman
to say what that one thing is...

682
00:43:42,689 --> 00:43:44,361
...in front of the children.

683
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,843
Even if I am just a glorified boarder.

684
00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:04,843
Hi. I'd like the number
for Stanley Rosenfeld Photo Studios.

685
00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:14,080
Photography is an art form,
if you take it seriously enough...

686
00:44:14,169 --> 00:44:15,966
...which I happen to do.

687
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:18,962
- Esther, you gorgeous thing, you.
- Stanley!

688
00:44:19,049 --> 00:44:23,167
- Smile for the birdie! Hold, hold.
- Stomach in, Harold.

689
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:24,718
Beautiful.

690
00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:26,601
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

691
00:44:27,649 --> 00:44:29,640
Your mother was something special.

692
00:44:29,729 --> 00:44:32,402
To tell you the truth,
I had quite a crush on her.

693
00:44:32,489 --> 00:44:33,808
- Really?
- Who didn't?

694
00:44:33,889 --> 00:44:37,359
She could play basketball like Jerry West,
she'd dance like Cyd Charisse.

695
00:44:37,969 --> 00:44:40,927
Then she'd look at you
with those blue eyes, forget about it.

696
00:44:41,009 --> 00:44:42,647
I asked her out a couple of times...

697
00:44:42,729 --> 00:44:44,640
...but she always said no.

698
00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:46,886
Lenny, Nancy, you just got married.

699
00:44:46,969 --> 00:44:49,324
Look happy! Look like you mean it.

700
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:51,608
Beautiful.

701
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:53,122
I remember those days.

702
00:44:53,209 --> 00:44:56,167
Then we all went off to UCLA
and she started hanging around...

703
00:44:56,249 --> 00:44:58,285
...with those drama department types.

704
00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:00,166
There was one guy, Peter Webb...

705
00:45:00,249 --> 00:45:02,365
...who's a big director in Hollywood now.

706
00:45:02,689 --> 00:45:06,159
The only reason I know him
is that we were all in a big poetry class...

707
00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:09,520
...with this crazy guy, Albert Boderfelder.

708
00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:13,003
- Beidermeyer?
- Beidermeyer, that's it!

709
00:45:13,089 --> 00:45:14,568
What a madman!

710
00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:16,840
- He's a great poet.
- He is?

711
00:45:16,929 --> 00:45:19,363
- Do you know him?
- Everybody did.

712
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:23,203
Walk along Citrus between Fountain
and Sunset any afternoon.

713
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:25,245
He'll remember my mother, for sure.

714
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:27,797
It was a big class, Vada, and...

715
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:32,926
But, well, of course he'll remember.
Who could forget Maggie?

716
00:45:33,089 --> 00:45:34,363
Just one more thing.

717
00:45:35,129 --> 00:45:36,801
Does this mean anything to you?

718
00:45:39,129 --> 00:45:41,643
No, it doesn't, but I wish it did.

719
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:45,088
Well, thanks for your help, Mr. Rosenfeld.

720
00:45:45,249 --> 00:45:47,558
I'm sorry my mother
wouldn't go out with you.

721
00:45:47,649 --> 00:45:49,799
I'm sure she would've had a great time.

722
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:52,039
I would've tried to show her a good time.

723
00:45:52,129 --> 00:45:55,360
I promised her that I'd never forget her
and I never did.

724
00:45:56,249 --> 00:45:58,683
Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.

725
00:46:02,249 --> 00:46:04,888
This is the street he walks down every day.

726
00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:08,757
- When he needs inspiration...
- Boy, you're really into this.

727
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:11,206
He is one of the great poets.

728
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:17,404
I think it's him.

729
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:28,688
He's writing.

730
00:46:34,169 --> 00:46:35,318
Hello?

731
00:46:36,529 --> 00:46:40,363
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies,
I'm borderline diabetic.

732
00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:43,485
You're Alfred Beidermeyer, aren't you?

733
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:45,766
You had to remind me?

734
00:46:46,529 --> 00:46:50,044
- Are you writing a poem?
- No, I'm writing the phone company...

735
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:54,004
...because they keep charging me
for calls to Caracas, Venezuela.

736
00:46:54,089 --> 00:46:56,887
Do you know anybody
in Caracas, Venezuela?

737
00:46:57,649 --> 00:46:58,684
No.

738
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:00,322
Neither do I.

739
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:04,437
"Ask not for whom the bell tolls."

740
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:07,767
Time for my medication and my nap.

741
00:47:10,449 --> 00:47:14,442
- Here, we'll help you carry this stuff.
- I can handle that.

742
00:47:16,169 --> 00:47:18,922
Oh, thank you. I'm in the penthouse.

743
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:28,718
Penthouse A. It's there, over on the left.

744
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:42,198
If he has a heart attack,
you're carrying the body down yourself.

745
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:51,597
- At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
- It keeps me young.

746
00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:03,805
- Where do you want this?
- Just put it over there.

747
00:48:08,449 --> 00:48:10,758
- Do you still teach?
- No, no, no.

748
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,959
I gave it up 10 years ago.

749
00:48:13,689 --> 00:48:15,327
Actually, it gave me up.

750
00:48:15,529 --> 00:48:18,089
My mother took this course with you
at UCLA.

751
00:48:18,289 --> 00:48:20,041
"Foundations of Poetic Thought."

752
00:48:20,129 --> 00:48:23,644
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.

753
00:48:24,049 --> 00:48:25,926
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.

754
00:48:26,129 --> 00:48:27,164
Oh.

755
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:28,803
Remember her?

756
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:31,557
I've been blessed with a very bad memory.

757
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:34,039
People say she looked like me.

758
00:48:35,489 --> 00:48:38,322
I was drinking a little in those days.

759
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:41,963
I'm drinking a little these days, too.

760
00:48:42,729 --> 00:48:45,084
I'm sure she found
your lectures fascinating.

761
00:48:45,169 --> 00:48:46,682
Oh, I doubt it.

762
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:51,042
Writers are notoriously boring.

763
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:52,721
No, they're not.

764
00:48:53,009 --> 00:48:54,761
I don't wanna be a writer.

765
00:48:55,169 --> 00:48:57,160
I wanna be just like you.

766
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:01,764
Me?

767
00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:06,321
My dear, this is not a country
that rewards poetry.

768
00:49:06,769 --> 00:49:09,602
This is a country that rewards gas mileage.

769
00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:14,720
Besides, people don't read poetry anymore,
they watch television.

770
00:49:16,049 --> 00:49:17,641
Don't be a poet.

771
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:20,239
Be a TV repairman!

772
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:40,808
Vada, come on.

773
00:49:41,809 --> 00:49:44,801
I've got a place I always go
when I need cheering up.

774
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:52,805
The tar pits?
This is where you come to get cheered up?

775
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,322
Look at it this way:

776
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:57,481
However bad I feel,
it isn't as bad as becoming extinct...

777
00:49:57,569 --> 00:49:59,639
...in a bottomless pit of tar.

778
00:50:00,169 --> 00:50:02,205
And I thought I was weird.

779
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:03,888
You are weird.

780
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:07,242
Let's just go.

781
00:50:07,369 --> 00:50:10,167
Oh, no. Wait.
I like that you brought me here.

782
00:50:11,329 --> 00:50:15,322
Hey, what do I care?
I mean, consider the source:

783
00:50:15,649 --> 00:50:18,800
A chick from Pennsylvania
who wears a mood ring.

784
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:21,007
This isn't just a mood ring.

785
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:23,522
Does it work?

786
00:50:24,529 --> 00:50:26,918
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything...

787
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:31,605
It's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.

788
00:50:33,129 --> 00:50:34,448
Boyfriend?

789
00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:37,602
Well, he was a boy. He was my friend.

790
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,925
He was my best friend.

791
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,001
When we were kids we were gonna...

792
00:50:45,089 --> 00:50:47,728
...move out here and live
with the Brady Bunch.

793
00:50:51,809 --> 00:50:54,482
Then, I lost this ring in the woods...

794
00:50:56,209 --> 00:51:01,078
...and when he went to find it,
he got stung by bees and he died.

795
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:07,638
Do you think your friend's
up in heaven now...

796
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:10,688
...Iooking down on you,
and watching you all the time?

797
00:51:12,849 --> 00:51:16,000
Well, I hope he's not watching me
all the time.

798
00:51:21,769 --> 00:51:23,805
Let me see if it changes colours on me.

799
00:51:24,569 --> 00:51:25,524
Okay.

800
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:30,124
But be careful.
It has a lot of sentimental value.

801
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:34,005
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.

802
00:51:34,689 --> 00:51:36,725
Well, don't force it. You'll break it.

803
00:51:36,809 --> 00:51:39,607
I'm not gonna break it.
I just wanna see it change colours.

804
00:51:39,929 --> 00:51:42,602
I want it back now.
I never should have taken it off.

805
00:51:42,689 --> 00:51:45,283
- I want it back.
- Hey, relax! I'm not gonna break it!

806
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:47,007
- Give it to me.
- Come and get it.

807
00:51:47,089 --> 00:51:48,966
- Just give it to me!
- It's right here.

808
00:51:49,049 --> 00:51:50,277
Just come and get it.

809
00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:52,121
- Right here.
- Don't! Come on.

810
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,608
Watch it.

811
00:51:53,729 --> 00:51:55,208
Don't!

812
00:51:57,089 --> 00:51:58,238
Uh-oh.

813
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:01,685
What do you mean, "uh-oh"?

814
00:52:03,169 --> 00:52:04,602
I dropped it.

815
00:52:04,969 --> 00:52:06,322
In the tar?

816
00:52:07,689 --> 00:52:10,328
It was an accident. I'll get you a new one.

817
00:52:11,409 --> 00:52:13,161
Where are you going?

818
00:52:14,809 --> 00:52:16,959
Vada, wait up! Wait!

819
00:52:21,729 --> 00:52:24,687
- What are you doing? You can't go in.
- Oh, no?

820
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:27,398
- It's dangerous!
- Leave me alone.

821
00:52:29,769 --> 00:52:33,205
That ring is the only thing
I have left of Thomas J. I have to get it.

822
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:35,247
You mean this ring?

823
00:52:40,129 --> 00:52:42,085
You jerk! You idiot!

824
00:52:42,569 --> 00:52:44,878
You hit pretty good, for a girl!

825
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:14,363
Nicholas!

826
00:53:15,169 --> 00:53:17,000
What are you doing up?

827
00:53:19,889 --> 00:53:21,447
I'm thirsty.

828
00:53:21,529 --> 00:53:23,520
There's water in your bathroom.

829
00:53:23,609 --> 00:53:25,042
I want juice.

830
00:53:25,409 --> 00:53:28,128
- Don't wake up Vada.
- I won't.

831
00:53:41,569 --> 00:53:43,958
I think Maggie could've been
a major player.

832
00:53:44,049 --> 00:53:45,402
She had the talent.

833
00:53:45,609 --> 00:53:48,169
God knows that face was made
for close-ups.

834
00:53:48,249 --> 00:53:50,922
And everything was magic with Maggie.

835
00:53:51,009 --> 00:53:54,240
I remember we were walking down
Hollywood Boulevard one night...

836
00:53:54,329 --> 00:53:56,638
...and we put our feet
in the stars' footprints.

837
00:53:56,729 --> 00:53:59,880
You know, like tourists do?
Maggie could not believe it.

838
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:02,278
Her feet were the same size
as Judy Garland.

839
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:05,169
'Course, mine matched perfectly
with Orson Welles.

840
00:54:05,649 --> 00:54:06,684
Just kidding.

841
00:54:09,129 --> 00:54:11,518
You should call Hillary Mitchell.

842
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:13,845
She and Maggie were very close.

843
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:17,160
She's got this funky little clothing store
over here on Melrose.

844
00:54:17,249 --> 00:54:20,605
I'd call her for you, but, well,
we kinda had this thing...

845
00:54:20,689 --> 00:54:23,761
...you know, and it got a little messy.

846
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:26,244
Thanks.

847
00:54:28,249 --> 00:54:30,399
Would you know what this is?

848
00:54:30,489 --> 00:54:31,717
Well, not really.

849
00:54:31,929 --> 00:54:36,684
Could be the date of an opening,
an audition, birthday?

850
00:54:37,169 --> 00:54:39,046
Not my birthday. I don't know.

851
00:54:39,129 --> 00:54:41,518
Who writes dates on paper bags?

852
00:54:41,809 --> 00:54:43,003
My mum.

853
00:54:43,169 --> 00:54:46,684
Whoa! I have got to get to dailies.
I gotta break this up.

854
00:54:46,769 --> 00:54:49,408
Well, thanks for your time.
I know you're very busy.

855
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:51,719
You are Maggie all over again.

856
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:55,083
You let me know
if you ever want to be a movie star.

857
00:54:55,569 --> 00:54:57,719
You got the face for close-ups, too.

858
00:54:57,809 --> 00:54:59,003
Thanks.

859
00:55:06,129 --> 00:55:07,562
What a dufus.

860
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:17,724
We may go for coffee after the meeting,
so don't expect us before midnight.

861
00:55:17,809 --> 00:55:20,323
- There's fruit.
- You know where the extinguisher is.

862
00:55:20,409 --> 00:55:22,969
If the fruit bursts into flames,
I'll be prepared.

863
00:55:23,209 --> 00:55:24,847
You're so clever.

864
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:28,437
- Are you all right, honey?
- I'm just tired.

865
00:55:28,569 --> 00:55:31,003
Well, get to bed early
and don't let anybody in.

866
00:55:31,089 --> 00:55:33,284
- 'Bye.
- Lock the door.

867
00:55:47,889 --> 00:55:49,880
We have lift-off.

868
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:53,757
Joan Crawford! Oh, I love her.

869
00:55:53,849 --> 00:55:55,567
There's the Marx Brothers!

870
00:55:57,009 --> 00:56:01,241
- Carole Lombard! My dad's favourite.
- Never heard of her.

871
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:04,123
Montgomery Clift! Wait till I tell Shelly.

872
00:56:04,369 --> 00:56:06,121
Here's Judy Garland!

873
00:56:11,129 --> 00:56:15,884
- My mother stood on this very spot.
- I'm afraid your feet won't fit there.

874
00:56:18,969 --> 00:56:22,200
That's 'cause I was cursed
with the Sultenfuss bear claws.

875
00:56:24,609 --> 00:56:26,759
- My hands fit.
- Big deal.

876
00:56:32,169 --> 00:56:33,397
What's he smoking?

877
00:56:33,529 --> 00:56:35,201
What do you think?

878
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:37,123
Really?

879
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:46,728
Hey, look.

880
00:56:55,449 --> 00:56:57,883
This is a totally barbaric custom.

881
00:57:01,129 --> 00:57:04,280
So, if Phil marries my mum,
she'd be your aunt, right?

882
00:57:04,969 --> 00:57:06,084
Right.

883
00:57:06,409 --> 00:57:07,922
And you'd be my cousin?

884
00:57:09,289 --> 00:57:11,928
Yeah, I guess. Sort of.

885
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:15,767
But we wouldn't really be related, right?

886
00:57:16,129 --> 00:57:19,201
Oh, no, we wouldn't be
from the same bloodlines or anything.

887
00:57:19,689 --> 00:57:23,967
We'd be like two total strangers
who accidentally had relatives...

888
00:57:24,049 --> 00:57:25,528
...who got married.

889
00:57:25,929 --> 00:57:27,806
Good. I mean...

890
00:57:29,289 --> 00:57:31,598
Marriage can really complicate things.

891
00:57:34,969 --> 00:57:38,245
So, aren't you gonna say anything
about my earrings?

892
00:57:38,769 --> 00:57:40,168
I already did.

893
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:42,365
It's a totally barbaric custom.

894
00:57:43,249 --> 00:57:44,523
But on you...

895
00:57:45,889 --> 00:57:47,288
...it looks good.

896
00:58:05,929 --> 00:58:08,284
- We should've called.
- It's not that late.

897
00:58:18,849 --> 00:58:20,805
You're grounded till you're 50.

898
00:58:20,889 --> 00:58:23,198
- You're overreacting.
- Make that 60.

899
00:58:23,329 --> 00:58:25,479
And I'm docking your allowance
for two weeks.

900
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:27,446
- Mum!
- You think this is easy for me?

901
00:58:27,529 --> 00:58:29,884
You go out and I get to be the bad guy.

902
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,761
I don't want you to be a delinquent...

903
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:34,409
...but I can't do my job
if you don't do yours.

904
00:58:34,489 --> 00:58:37,322
- It's not his fault.
- No. It was me.

905
00:58:38,089 --> 00:58:39,727
I'm sorry, Mum. Really.

906
00:58:39,809 --> 00:58:42,369
Just tell me what to do. I'll do anything.

907
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:43,963
Go to your room.

908
00:58:46,129 --> 00:58:47,198
And you.

909
00:58:47,449 --> 00:58:50,680
Your father didn't give you permission
to pierce your ears, did he?

910
00:58:50,769 --> 00:58:52,168
Not exactly.

911
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:55,399
Well, just don't shave your legs.

912
00:58:55,569 --> 00:58:59,482
He'll never let you visit us again if I send
you home hairless and full of holes.

913
00:59:21,569 --> 00:59:24,037
- Good morning.
- Well, maybe for you.

914
00:59:24,249 --> 00:59:26,001
- Is something wrong?
- You're lucky...

915
00:59:26,089 --> 00:59:28,478
...you deal with kids
who are under anaesthesia.

916
00:59:29,449 --> 00:59:33,362
Well, even without anaesthesia,
I always tell my patients to...

917
00:59:34,969 --> 00:59:36,118
...relax.

918
00:59:37,329 --> 00:59:39,889
Isn't it time for your coffee break
or something?

919
00:59:39,969 --> 00:59:42,403
There must be someplace
where we can go, talk.

920
00:59:42,489 --> 00:59:44,400
Oh, no, I couldn't.

921
00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:46,128
You couldn't?

922
00:59:46,209 --> 00:59:48,006
Well, I'm sort of involved.

923
00:59:48,329 --> 00:59:51,799
- Sort of?
- Let's just say I'm involved.

924
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:55,044
Where I come from, involvement calls for...

925
00:59:55,129 --> 00:59:56,960
...a substantial piece of jewellery.

926
00:59:57,049 --> 00:59:59,609
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewellery.

927
01:00:00,689 --> 01:00:04,079
Alright, so you don't like jewellery,
but you do like good music.

928
01:00:04,329 --> 01:00:06,445
Liszt. One of my favourites.

929
01:00:08,089 --> 01:00:10,649
Liszt was my parents' favourite.
They were Hungarian.

930
01:00:10,729 --> 01:00:13,687
Hungarians.
Famous for their beautiful music...

931
01:00:14,969 --> 01:00:16,641
...their beautiful women.

932
01:00:16,729 --> 01:00:19,243
Doctor Helburn! What a surprise.

933
01:00:19,809 --> 01:00:23,643
In the last couple of days, we've changed
your oil, relined your brakes...

934
01:00:23,809 --> 01:00:26,960
...balanced and rotated your tyres,
aligned your front-end...

935
01:00:27,129 --> 01:00:29,324
...and flushed out
your entire cooling system.

936
01:00:29,409 --> 01:00:32,401
I really didn't expect to be seeing you
for another 3000 miles.

937
01:00:32,489 --> 01:00:35,845
Well, what can I say, Phil?
It's just I feel so welcome here.

938
01:00:35,929 --> 01:00:37,123
And you are.

939
01:00:41,489 --> 01:00:43,320
Why don't I come in the morning?

940
01:00:43,409 --> 01:00:45,764
You can check out that left blinker for me.

941
01:00:46,089 --> 01:00:47,602
Oh, sure. Okay.

942
01:00:48,569 --> 01:00:50,844
I'll see you then. I look forward to it.

943
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:06,998
We really ought to flush out
that line of bullshit he's got.

944
01:01:07,729 --> 01:01:10,926
"Hungarians are famous
for their beautiful women."

945
01:01:11,089 --> 01:01:15,207
What's wrong with a little flattery?
What's wrong with a little appreciation?

946
01:01:15,289 --> 01:01:17,120
Are you saying I don't appreciate?

947
01:01:17,209 --> 01:01:20,042
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee,
like a real date.

948
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:22,160
When was the last time you did that?

949
01:01:22,249 --> 01:01:24,319
What do you mean?
We have a date every night.

950
01:01:24,409 --> 01:01:27,640
No, that's not a date.
A date is when I don't cook.

951
01:01:30,249 --> 01:01:32,001
I do the dishes.

952
01:01:36,009 --> 01:01:39,524
<i>I'd go to a fortune teller,</i>
<i>but they can only predict the future.</i>

953
01:01:40,889 --> 01:01:43,403
<i>I need someone who can predict the past.</i>

954
01:01:51,769 --> 01:01:54,886
Hi. Can I help you?

955
01:01:55,769 --> 01:01:59,159
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went
to school with Maggie Muldovan?

956
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:00,887
Maggie Muldovan?

957
01:02:01,849 --> 01:02:03,567
Did you know her?

958
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:05,481
She's her daughter, Vada.

959
01:02:06,969 --> 01:02:08,448
Of course!

960
01:02:10,209 --> 01:02:11,608
Look at you.

961
01:02:11,809 --> 01:02:15,643
It's the eyes mostly, and the hair, too.

962
01:02:17,049 --> 01:02:18,801
And now she's gone.

963
01:02:19,289 --> 01:02:20,244
She's gone.

964
01:02:21,009 --> 01:02:24,285
She'll never get to see
how well you've turned out.

965
01:02:26,689 --> 01:02:28,008
Oh, my God!

966
01:02:29,129 --> 01:02:30,448
Maggie!

967
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,961
You poor thing.

968
01:02:34,529 --> 01:02:37,123
It's okay, really. I was just a baby.

969
01:02:40,249 --> 01:02:42,001
I'm sorry. It's just...

970
01:02:43,369 --> 01:02:46,918
...I've been taking all these seminars
to get in touch with my feelings...

971
01:02:47,089 --> 01:02:49,649
...and sometimes it gets outta hand.

972
01:02:51,169 --> 01:02:52,158
Here.

973
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:55,442
Thank you. You're very sweet.

974
01:02:58,609 --> 01:03:00,679
How did you find out where I was?

975
01:03:01,089 --> 01:03:02,408
Peter Webb told us.

976
01:03:03,609 --> 01:03:04,644
Peter?

977
01:03:05,649 --> 01:03:06,877
You saw Peter?

978
01:03:08,209 --> 01:03:09,437
Oh, God.

979
01:03:20,489 --> 01:03:24,118
Forgive me. I'm making such a scene here.

980
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:27,045
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Thanks.

981
01:03:27,409 --> 01:03:30,481
I remember Maggie and your dad, too.

982
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:35,400
You know, we used to all pile
into his old '54 Ford pickup.

983
01:03:36,289 --> 01:03:38,644
"Chuck the truck" we used to call it.

984
01:03:39,289 --> 01:03:42,520
It was pitch black with red leather interior.

985
01:03:43,329 --> 01:03:45,320
Does he still drive that?

986
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:48,287
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.

987
01:03:49,649 --> 01:03:51,367
He's an undertaker.

988
01:03:51,529 --> 01:03:53,042
You're kidding.

989
01:03:53,369 --> 01:03:55,724
Jeffrey Pommeroy's an undertaker?

990
01:03:58,529 --> 01:04:00,679
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.

991
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,127
What are you saying?

992
01:04:09,649 --> 01:04:11,048
Look, I...

993
01:04:11,609 --> 01:04:14,077
Are you saying my mum
had another husband?

994
01:04:14,169 --> 01:04:18,242
Honey, back then, people did crazy things.

995
01:04:18,769 --> 01:04:19,963
They sure did!

996
01:04:20,049 --> 01:04:23,200
They got kicked outta school,
they married truck drivers.

997
01:04:23,809 --> 01:04:26,243
These are my mother's
greatest accomplishments?

998
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:29,401
I'm sure glad I came all the way out here
to find them out.

999
01:04:38,849 --> 01:04:39,998
Vada, wait up!

1000
01:04:41,209 --> 01:04:45,725
Just 'cause your mum was married before,
doesn't mean anything.

1001
01:04:47,169 --> 01:04:49,637
Maybe not. But maybe it does.

1002
01:04:51,369 --> 01:04:53,564
If no one told me about this...

1003
01:04:53,809 --> 01:04:56,118
Maybe they're trying to hide something.

1004
01:04:56,569 --> 01:04:57,888
Like what?

1005
01:04:59,049 --> 01:05:01,927
Maybe this Jeffrey guy is my real father.

1006
01:05:05,089 --> 01:05:06,283
Look at me.

1007
01:05:06,689 --> 01:05:09,522
I have the hair of a dead person,
and my nose...

1008
01:05:10,809 --> 01:05:12,959
No one in my family has this nose.

1009
01:05:13,649 --> 01:05:16,527
It could be the nose
of a complete stranger.

1010
01:05:18,009 --> 01:05:21,319
I came out here to find out
about my mother and I found...

1011
01:05:22,289 --> 01:05:23,278
God.

1012
01:05:24,649 --> 01:05:25,843
Don't cry.

1013
01:05:27,009 --> 01:05:28,078
Come on.

1014
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:31,723
That lady in there
looked pretty flaky to me.

1015
01:05:33,169 --> 01:05:36,479
How bout Phil?
Maybe he knows something about all this.

1016
01:05:36,649 --> 01:05:39,846
At least you should talk to him
before you get worked up.

1017
01:05:41,609 --> 01:05:43,440
Before I get worked up?

1018
01:05:45,009 --> 01:05:47,318
You don't think this is worked up?

1019
01:05:55,129 --> 01:05:57,279
That thing you said about your nose?

1020
01:05:58,369 --> 01:06:00,087
That it was a stranger's nose?

1021
01:06:00,809 --> 01:06:02,322
It's not. It's...

1022
01:06:02,809 --> 01:06:04,083
I mean...

1023
01:06:04,849 --> 01:06:06,362
It's yours.

1024
01:06:10,329 --> 01:06:11,444
Nick?

1025
01:06:12,289 --> 01:06:13,404
Yeah?

1026
01:06:15,169 --> 01:06:17,637
This has been a real confusing day.

1027
01:06:22,129 --> 01:06:25,007
How could Dad let me visit here
and find out like this?

1028
01:06:29,409 --> 01:06:32,287
I'm gonna call him
and make him tell me everything.

1029
01:06:33,449 --> 01:06:34,677
Sweetie, I...

1030
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:37,887
Don't worry,
I'll do it in my own subtle way.

1031
01:06:44,049 --> 01:06:45,721
<i>Hello, Sultenfuss Parlour.</i>

1032
01:06:45,809 --> 01:06:47,720
- Hi, Dad.
<i>- Hi, honey!</i>

1033
01:06:47,929 --> 01:06:50,841
I just called to say
that I'm having a really great time.

1034
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:54,359
<i>Good. You should go over</i>
<i>and watch them tape Carson.</i>

1035
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:59,319
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.

1036
01:07:00,689 --> 01:07:03,203
Is he some kind of a new rock star
or something?

1037
01:07:05,049 --> 01:07:06,004
Yeah.

1038
01:07:06,089 --> 01:07:07,442
<i>Totally groovy, huh?</i>

1039
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:08,445
Totally.

1040
01:07:08,929 --> 01:07:10,806
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.

1041
01:07:12,129 --> 01:07:13,198
I will.

1042
01:07:13,809 --> 01:07:15,003
How's Shelly?

1043
01:07:16,289 --> 01:07:17,278
She's fine.

1044
01:07:17,369 --> 01:07:21,282
The doctor just told her to stay in bed
and get a little rest...

1045
01:07:21,409 --> 01:07:23,877
...and stay quiet just to make sure that...

1046
01:07:24,809 --> 01:07:25,878
Okay.

1047
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:28,281
'Bye, Daddy. I love you.

1048
01:07:28,769 --> 01:07:31,522
- I love you too, sweetie pie.
<i>- My love to Shelly.</i>

1049
01:07:38,049 --> 01:07:39,323
Shelly's sick.

1050
01:07:39,929 --> 01:07:43,205
I have to get to the bottom
of this whole thing and get back there.

1051
01:07:43,289 --> 01:07:44,847
She'll be all right, baby.

1052
01:07:44,929 --> 01:07:46,157
Yeah. Right.

1053
01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:49,679
It's pointless to worry.

1054
01:07:50,929 --> 01:07:53,887
I'm not authorised to trace licenses
for civilians.

1055
01:07:54,209 --> 01:07:57,804
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy,
and he used to drive a '54 Ford pickup.

1056
01:07:57,889 --> 01:07:59,527
Black with red interior.

1057
01:08:00,569 --> 01:08:01,684
Please?

1058
01:08:02,449 --> 01:08:03,802
Give us a break.

1059
01:08:03,889 --> 01:08:06,278
All you have to do is make a phone call.

1060
01:08:07,689 --> 01:08:09,998
I thought I told you to lose this guy.

1061
01:08:10,089 --> 01:08:14,799
Sergeant, I know I said some things
last time that I shouldn't have said at all...

1062
01:08:14,889 --> 01:08:17,722
I think the phrase was "sleazoid geek."

1063
01:08:17,929 --> 01:08:19,487
I'm sorry, okay?

1064
01:08:19,569 --> 01:08:22,288
We gotta find this guy
because he knew Vada's mum...

1065
01:08:22,369 --> 01:08:25,327
...and he could tell her stuff
that no one else knows.

1066
01:08:25,409 --> 01:08:27,445
You're still asking me to break the law.

1067
01:08:27,529 --> 01:08:30,168
No, we're asking you to stand up
with Maggie Muldovan...

1068
01:08:30,249 --> 01:08:31,841
...like you should've years ago.

1069
01:08:41,769 --> 01:08:44,522
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka
from Hollenbeck.

1070
01:08:45,089 --> 01:08:47,284
I need a current address for a Jeffrey...

1071
01:08:47,369 --> 01:08:48,358
Pommeroy.

1072
01:08:48,489 --> 01:08:49,524
Pommeroy.

1073
01:08:50,249 --> 01:08:53,207
He may or may not be driving
a black '54 Ford pickup.

1074
01:08:55,729 --> 01:08:56,923
Monday.

1075
01:08:57,089 --> 01:08:58,807
I'm leaving Sunday.

1076
01:09:00,489 --> 01:09:02,161
Could you hold on for a second?

1077
01:09:03,649 --> 01:09:06,766
I can't get priority
without a criminal charge.

1078
01:09:06,849 --> 01:09:09,488
Charge him with something.
Who's gonna know?

1079
01:09:09,849 --> 01:09:11,328
Me! I'll know.

1080
01:09:11,729 --> 01:09:13,924
Do you wanna be a hall monitor
all your life?

1081
01:09:18,729 --> 01:09:19,718
Hello.

1082
01:09:20,369 --> 01:09:22,564
I'm gonna need this right now.

1083
01:09:22,969 --> 01:09:24,038
This guy.

1084
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:27,758
We think
he might be going after the governor.

1085
01:09:30,809 --> 01:09:33,004
Twenty minutes? Fine.

1086
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:40,084
Give him a call.

1087
01:09:40,169 --> 01:09:42,478
The worst he can do
is hang up on you, right?

1088
01:09:42,969 --> 01:09:46,120
I feel like before I can talk to him,
I have to see his face.

1089
01:09:48,449 --> 01:09:50,485
How's this for a solution?

1090
01:09:51,609 --> 01:09:56,160
We'll take a drive over to his place.
You can introduce yourself...

1091
01:09:56,369 --> 01:09:58,166
I'd like to see his house, but...

1092
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:02,608
...I don't know if I'd have the nerve
to just go up and knock on his door.

1093
01:10:03,649 --> 01:10:05,719
I don't think I could go through with it.

1094
01:10:05,809 --> 01:10:07,401
Then we'll keep driving.

1095
01:10:07,609 --> 01:10:08,928
You'll decide.

1096
01:10:19,569 --> 01:10:21,366
You're awfully quiet.

1097
01:10:23,609 --> 01:10:26,362
Do you think I should tell my dad
about Jeffrey Pommeroy?

1098
01:10:28,649 --> 01:10:31,607
I don't know. He's got an awful lot
on his mind right now.

1099
01:10:32,369 --> 01:10:34,599
Maybe some day when the time is right.

1100
01:10:36,049 --> 01:10:37,198
Maybe.

1101
01:10:38,129 --> 01:10:40,962
Then again,
your dad's got his own memories...

1102
01:10:41,049 --> 01:10:43,199
...and he's got his own life now.

1103
01:10:44,249 --> 01:10:47,764
I think this is a secret,
just between you and your mum.

1104
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:51,604
A secret? I like that.

1105
01:11:21,529 --> 01:11:23,281
This is it, I guess.

1106
01:11:30,209 --> 01:11:33,804
Well, we've come this far,
the least I can do is knock on the door.

1107
01:11:35,609 --> 01:11:36,803
Want me to come with?

1108
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:39,807
I should do this myself.

1109
01:11:39,969 --> 01:11:42,164
Okay. Take your time.

1110
01:11:42,369 --> 01:11:44,166
I'll go for a walk around.

1111
01:12:16,969 --> 01:12:19,005
Go ahead, honey. Go ahead.

1112
01:12:33,329 --> 01:12:34,603
Hi there.

1113
01:12:37,129 --> 01:12:38,244
Can I help you?

1114
01:12:39,569 --> 01:12:41,287
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?

1115
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:43,640
I sure am. Who are you?

1116
01:12:46,169 --> 01:12:48,285
I'm Vada Margaret Sultenfuss.

1117
01:12:49,689 --> 01:12:51,520
- And my mother was...
- Maggie.

1118
01:12:52,209 --> 01:12:53,562
Maggie's little girl.

1119
01:12:56,849 --> 01:12:58,567
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.

1120
01:13:00,289 --> 01:13:02,359
You mean you knew about me?

1121
01:13:02,809 --> 01:13:04,083
Who is it, honey?

1122
01:13:04,169 --> 01:13:06,444
It's Maggie's little girl, Vada.

1123
01:13:07,329 --> 01:13:09,684
Oh. Oh, my.

1124
01:13:09,769 --> 01:13:11,600
- This is my wife, Emily.
- Hi.

1125
01:13:12,369 --> 01:13:13,404
Hi.

1126
01:13:15,849 --> 01:13:17,726
Can you come in for a minute?

1127
01:13:18,449 --> 01:13:20,201
I'd like to. Thanks.

1128
01:13:28,009 --> 01:13:29,203
Mummy! Daddy!

1129
01:13:29,329 --> 01:13:31,638
I painted you a rainbow. Come and see!

1130
01:13:32,049 --> 01:13:33,607
This is Vada.

1131
01:13:33,689 --> 01:13:35,884
Vada, this our little girl, Katie.

1132
01:13:36,049 --> 01:13:37,482
- Hi.
- Hi.

1133
01:13:40,329 --> 01:13:43,446
Why don't we let Daddy and Vada
visit for a little while, okay?

1134
01:13:43,529 --> 01:13:44,848
- Okay.
- Okay.

1135
01:13:45,969 --> 01:13:47,607
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

1136
01:13:50,849 --> 01:13:53,409
She looks a little like me
when I was a little girl.

1137
01:13:53,489 --> 01:13:54,365
Does she?

1138
01:13:57,049 --> 01:13:58,323
I'm glad you're here.

1139
01:13:58,609 --> 01:13:59,359
You are?

1140
01:13:59,849 --> 01:14:02,488
Yeah. Come on, let's talk.

1141
01:14:05,409 --> 01:14:08,481
We had an assignment
to write about someone we've never met...

1142
01:14:08,769 --> 01:14:09,804
...and I chose my mother.

1143
01:14:09,889 --> 01:14:13,165
She was born in LA,
and since my Uncle Phil moved out here...

1144
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:16,446
...I came to visit him.
Then I looked in her high school yearbook...

1145
01:14:16,529 --> 01:14:19,726
...and I called a few people.
One guy said that she went to UCLA.

1146
01:14:19,809 --> 01:14:22,084
Another guy said
I should call Hillary Mitchell...

1147
01:14:22,169 --> 01:14:23,807
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?

1148
01:14:24,169 --> 01:14:25,363
She's great.

1149
01:14:25,449 --> 01:14:27,167
She's a little crazy, though.

1150
01:14:27,689 --> 01:14:29,964
Hillary said that you had
a black Ford truck...

1151
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:33,359
...and this policeman I know
got in touch with Motor Vehicles...

1152
01:14:33,449 --> 01:14:36,009
...and he gave me your address
and here I am.

1153
01:14:37,729 --> 01:14:39,481
I told you it was a long story.

1154
01:14:39,569 --> 01:14:42,606
That's all right. You know,
you sounded just like your mother.

1155
01:14:42,689 --> 01:14:44,407
She told great stories.

1156
01:14:44,529 --> 01:14:47,805
Stories with crazy accents
and special effects.

1157
01:14:48,249 --> 01:14:49,364
Special effects?

1158
01:14:49,449 --> 01:14:52,885
Like switching the lamp on and off
when she was talking about lightning.

1159
01:14:53,169 --> 01:14:55,285
Audiences love stuff like that.

1160
01:14:55,369 --> 01:14:57,724
And your mum knew
how to work an audience.

1161
01:14:57,809 --> 01:14:59,686
I don't know very much about her.

1162
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:01,926
I was hoping that you could help me.

1163
01:15:02,009 --> 01:15:02,885
I'll try.

1164
01:15:06,089 --> 01:15:08,159
No one else knows what this means.

1165
01:15:18,569 --> 01:15:21,925
The thing is we always wanted
to work in the theatre.

1166
01:15:23,169 --> 01:15:25,842
We drove out to New York, to Broadway...

1167
01:15:26,369 --> 01:15:28,963
...where it was all happening.

1168
01:15:29,849 --> 01:15:33,683
And New York was just full
of fancy French restaurants...

1169
01:15:33,769 --> 01:15:36,078
...and we wanted to get married in one.

1170
01:15:36,289 --> 01:15:38,325
But we were totally broke.

1171
01:15:38,729 --> 01:15:42,165
Your mum found this little coffee shop
with tables around the back...

1172
01:15:42,249 --> 01:15:46,003
...and real tablecloths on 'em,
and a minister who worked cheap.

1173
01:15:46,249 --> 01:15:48,285
When we got down to the coffee shop...

1174
01:15:48,369 --> 01:15:52,408
...there was a sign on the door that said,
"Closed by the Board of Health."

1175
01:15:52,489 --> 01:15:54,559
By that time, it had started snowing...

1176
01:15:54,649 --> 01:15:58,801
...so we just got married
right outside in the snow.

1177
01:16:00,449 --> 01:16:01,802
It was freezing.

1178
01:16:03,129 --> 01:16:04,642
But it was wonderful.

1179
01:16:06,449 --> 01:16:11,079
And for our wedding feast,
we had a bag of hot-roasted chestnuts.

1180
01:16:11,489 --> 01:16:12,808
This is the bag.

1181
01:16:14,609 --> 01:16:16,042
And she saved it.

1182
01:16:17,849 --> 01:16:19,487
We didn't have a camera.

1183
01:16:21,169 --> 01:16:23,637
So she just wrote the date
on the bag and said:

1184
01:16:23,729 --> 01:16:27,563
"This'll be our wedding album.
This'll be a day we'll never forget."

1185
01:16:29,729 --> 01:16:31,162
We never did.

1186
01:16:35,649 --> 01:16:37,640
Do you have any pictures of her?

1187
01:16:38,529 --> 01:16:40,565
I've got something better.

1188
01:16:47,009 --> 01:16:50,365
We called ourselves
"The Appearing Nightly Players."

1189
01:16:53,689 --> 01:16:56,408
<i>Darling! Where is my chauffeur?</i>

1190
01:16:56,569 --> 01:16:58,719
<i>You don't want I should walk to the stage?</i>

1191
01:16:58,809 --> 01:17:01,403
<i>An actress of my overwhelming talent!</i>

1192
01:17:08,649 --> 01:17:10,241
She's beautiful.

1193
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:21,239
We performed on the beach one summer.

1194
01:17:22,329 --> 01:17:24,160
Everything went wrong.

1195
01:18:10,169 --> 01:18:12,729
<i>- Come on, send me away happy.</i>
<i>- Send him away!</i>

1196
01:19:45,889 --> 01:19:48,244
<i>- That was beautiful.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

1197
01:19:48,969 --> 01:19:52,484
<i>- You do it all the time. That was beautiful.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

1198
01:20:13,689 --> 01:20:15,725
She had a beautiful voice.

1199
01:20:21,729 --> 01:20:24,243
Would you like to have these movies?

1200
01:20:28,609 --> 01:20:30,520
More than anything in the world.

1201
01:20:32,449 --> 01:20:35,646
It's good to see Maggie again and you.

1202
01:20:38,449 --> 01:20:40,201
Didn't you ever wonder about me?

1203
01:20:40,289 --> 01:20:43,918
Well, I didn't know about you
until after she was gone.

1204
01:20:45,609 --> 01:20:50,000
I thought that maybe you'd be curious
about how I turned out.

1205
01:20:50,849 --> 01:20:52,601
I'd say you turned out just fine.

1206
01:20:52,689 --> 01:20:56,523
I guess what I mean is,
my mother married my dad after you.

1207
01:20:56,929 --> 01:21:00,763
And then I was born, so I thought that
maybe you got divorced because of me.

1208
01:21:00,849 --> 01:21:02,885
Wait a minute.

1209
01:21:04,529 --> 01:21:06,042
Do you think I'm your father?

1210
01:21:09,649 --> 01:21:12,561
Honey, I'd be proud
to be your father, really.

1211
01:21:16,129 --> 01:21:17,721
It just isn't so.

1212
01:21:19,649 --> 01:21:20,684
Come on.

1213
01:21:27,089 --> 01:21:29,125
Maggie wanted to have a baby.

1214
01:21:30,489 --> 01:21:32,286
And I didn't.

1215
01:21:35,129 --> 01:21:38,360
She didn't want to miss out on anything,
especially motherhood.

1216
01:21:39,129 --> 01:21:41,199
It got to be a real problem with us.

1217
01:21:42,849 --> 01:21:44,919
I thought she had plenty of time.

1218
01:21:45,569 --> 01:21:46,684
She didn't.

1219
01:21:48,289 --> 01:21:52,407
Anyway, that's why I was grateful
when she met your father.

1220
01:21:52,889 --> 01:21:56,006
He had the sense to love her
the way she deserved.

1221
01:21:57,169 --> 01:22:00,286
Most of all, I was glad that she had you.

1222
01:22:01,729 --> 01:22:03,606
The baby she always wanted.

1223
01:22:04,009 --> 01:22:05,965
I want you to know that.

1224
01:22:13,889 --> 01:22:16,164
I'm gonna use the movies
when I give my report.

1225
01:22:16,249 --> 01:22:18,479
Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.

1226
01:22:18,569 --> 01:22:21,925
You better ace it.
You sacrificed our whole vacation.

1227
01:22:22,809 --> 01:22:26,199
It's a wonderful story
with a very happy ending.

1228
01:22:30,769 --> 01:22:34,125
Sorry, Doc. We close for business
at 3:00 tonight.

1229
01:22:36,009 --> 01:22:37,488
This isn't business.

1230
01:22:38,009 --> 01:22:40,728
I found this wonderful
little Hungarian restaurant...

1231
01:22:40,809 --> 01:22:42,128
...that makes its own strudel.

1232
01:22:42,209 --> 01:22:45,565
I thought you might like
a taste of the old country.

1233
01:22:46,289 --> 01:22:49,725
See, there's apple in there and cherry.

1234
01:22:50,009 --> 01:22:54,480
And this is the cheese, but I gotta say,
I think the cherry is really...

1235
01:22:54,729 --> 01:22:57,641
Okay, that does it.
That does it. The strudel does it.

1236
01:22:57,769 --> 01:22:59,999
- First it's the brakes, then...
- Wait a minute.

1237
01:23:00,089 --> 01:23:04,401
I'm not letting a podiatrist with a Jaguar
full of strudel come waltzing in here and...

1238
01:23:04,489 --> 01:23:06,923
I'm not a podiatrist. I'm a cardiologist.

1239
01:23:07,089 --> 01:23:08,078
Who cares?

1240
01:23:08,209 --> 01:23:10,484
Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.

1241
01:23:11,089 --> 01:23:13,364
What kind of arrangement?

1242
01:23:14,169 --> 01:23:16,125
Yes, what kind of arrangement?

1243
01:23:16,209 --> 01:23:19,679
I'd be very interested to know
what kind of arrangement we have.

1244
01:23:20,689 --> 01:23:23,078
You know exactly what kind it is.

1245
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:26,483
Come on, Rose.

1246
01:23:26,849 --> 01:23:28,328
What do you want from me?

1247
01:23:28,409 --> 01:23:30,604
I don't want anything
you don't wanna give me.

1248
01:23:30,689 --> 01:23:32,964
Don't settle for any less than you deserve.

1249
01:23:33,049 --> 01:23:34,243
You stay out of this!

1250
01:23:34,329 --> 01:23:38,845
If I had a red XK-150 with a black interior,
I wouldn't be offering relationship advice.

1251
01:23:38,969 --> 01:23:40,607
The interior's colour isn't germane...

1252
01:23:40,689 --> 01:23:44,762
- Rose, this isn't the place to have this...
- I think this place is just fine.

1253
01:23:51,249 --> 01:23:52,887
You know how I feel about you.

1254
01:23:53,929 --> 01:23:57,524
You like the way I cook?
You think I make out a great invoice?

1255
01:23:59,049 --> 01:24:02,644
You and Nick and this garage
are my whole life.

1256
01:24:03,969 --> 01:24:05,197
I love you.

1257
01:24:07,289 --> 01:24:10,008
Sure, you don't have
the greatest taste in music, but...

1258
01:24:11,049 --> 01:24:14,200
...there's not another woman
who could look so sexy in that smock.

1259
01:24:14,689 --> 01:24:16,361
What I'm trying to...

1260
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,447
What I mean to say...

1261
01:24:24,049 --> 01:24:25,402
Rose, will you marry me?

1262
01:24:26,489 --> 01:24:28,923
You really think I look sexy in this smock?

1263
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:31,168
Is that a "yes"?

1264
01:24:46,089 --> 01:24:49,479
- Thanks for everything. You're the best.
- No, you're the best.

1265
01:24:49,569 --> 01:24:51,958
I don't want you talking to anybody
on the plane.

1266
01:24:52,049 --> 01:24:53,801
Dad already gave me this lecture.

1267
01:24:53,889 --> 01:24:56,483
He'll meet me at the airport,
we'll have some pizza...

1268
01:24:56,569 --> 01:24:58,878
...then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.

1269
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:01,961
Sounds great. You give them both
one of these for me.

1270
01:25:04,929 --> 01:25:06,521
'Bye, "Aunt" Rose.

1271
01:25:06,609 --> 01:25:08,361
'Bye, "Niece" Vada.

1272
01:25:10,569 --> 01:25:11,718
Thanks.

1273
01:25:12,849 --> 01:25:14,123
Well, 'bye.

1274
01:25:25,969 --> 01:25:26,958
Listen.

1275
01:25:27,449 --> 01:25:31,158
I'm sorry you had to sacrifice
your entire vacation.

1276
01:25:32,209 --> 01:25:34,279
Some sacrifices are worth it.

1277
01:25:35,569 --> 01:25:37,764
You mean it wasn't that terrible?

1278
01:25:38,969 --> 01:25:40,925
I wouldn't say it was terrible.

1279
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:42,841
It was kind of...

1280
01:25:43,769 --> 01:25:45,202
An adventure?

1281
01:25:47,449 --> 01:25:48,802
Part adventure...

1282
01:25:51,529 --> 01:25:52,882
...part miracle.

1283
01:26:23,849 --> 01:26:25,840
Will you write me a poem?

1284
01:26:28,089 --> 01:26:29,124
No?

1285
01:26:29,689 --> 01:26:31,680
I'll write you 10 poems.

1286
01:26:35,289 --> 01:26:38,964
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is</i>
<i>your final boarding call for flight 6-2-8...</i>

1287
01:26:39,049 --> 01:26:40,562
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

1288
01:26:40,809 --> 01:26:42,640
Look in your backpack.

1289
01:26:44,689 --> 01:26:45,804
Okay.

1290
01:27:37,209 --> 01:27:40,758
<i>"In memory of barbaric customs.</i>
<i>Love, Nick."</i>

1291
01:27:48,249 --> 01:27:50,638
<i>Life is full of barbaric customs.</i>

1292
01:27:51,049 --> 01:27:53,688
<i>I just hope they all end</i>
<i>with a kiss like that.</i>

1293
01:28:12,169 --> 01:28:15,684
- Arthur! Where's my dad?
- He took Shelly to the hospital.

1294
01:28:16,009 --> 01:28:19,319
- Is she okay?
- She was making a lot of noise.

1295
01:28:37,769 --> 01:28:38,804
Dad!

1296
01:28:42,249 --> 01:28:45,082
- What happened to Shelly?
- She just had a baby, that's all.

1297
01:28:45,169 --> 01:28:46,727
We have a baby?

1298
01:28:46,849 --> 01:28:48,805
A boy. You've got a new brother.

1299
01:28:48,889 --> 01:28:51,164
- Can I see him?
- You can do anything you want.

1300
01:28:51,249 --> 01:28:52,477
You're his sister.

1301
01:28:53,969 --> 01:28:55,004
What's on your ear?

1302
01:28:56,089 --> 01:28:57,238
Shelly?

1303
01:29:04,249 --> 01:29:05,364
Look.

1304
01:29:06,449 --> 01:29:09,680
- He's so tiny.
- I know. Look at his little hands.

1305
01:29:10,489 --> 01:29:14,880
- I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up.
- I was pushing as fast as I could.

1306
01:29:15,809 --> 01:29:17,162
Did it hurt a lot?

1307
01:29:18,089 --> 01:29:19,727
You have no idea.

1308
01:29:25,249 --> 01:29:27,399
- Here, let me hold him.
- Okay.

1309
01:29:29,329 --> 01:29:30,557
- Got his head?
- Yeah.

1310
01:29:30,649 --> 01:29:31,764
Okay.

1311
01:29:32,969 --> 01:29:34,641
- You like that.
- Yes.

1312
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:42,762
Maybe he's wet.

1313
01:29:43,209 --> 01:29:44,608
Maybe he's hungry.

1314
01:29:45,009 --> 01:29:46,328
He's okay.

1315
01:29:46,529 --> 01:29:48,406
You just have to sing to him.

1316
01:30:32,409 --> 01:30:35,207
<i>Things haven't exactly calmed down</i>
<i>around here.</i>

1317
01:30:35,409 --> 01:30:37,161
<i>I got an A-plus on the report.</i>

1318
01:30:37,249 --> 01:30:41,527
<i>Dad's getting used to my pierced ears,</i>
<i>and Nick's coming to visit this summer.</i>

1319
01:30:41,689 --> 01:30:44,408
<i>Other than that,</i>
<i>I'm busy being a big sister.</i>

1320
01:30:44,929 --> 01:30:47,045
<i>I like to tell my brother about my mum...</i>

1321
01:30:47,129 --> 01:30:50,360
<i>... how I got to meet her friends,</i>
<i>and find out how special she was.</i>

1322
01:30:50,649 --> 01:30:52,844
<i>She may not have her footprints</i>
<i>in cement...</i>

1323
01:30:52,929 --> 01:30:55,443
<i>... but she definitely left her imprint</i>
<i>on the world.</i>

1324
01:30:55,529 --> 01:30:58,521
<i>And I told him that,</i>
<i>even though it sounds conceited...</i>

1325
01:30:58,609 --> 01:31:00,725
<i>... her greatest achievement was me.</i>
