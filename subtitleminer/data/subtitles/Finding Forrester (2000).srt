00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,918
Marker.

2
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,047
Jamal!

3
00:03:16,173 --> 00:03:18,175
Jamal, are you awake?

4
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:21,261
I know you can hear me.

5
00:03:21,678 --> 00:03:25,558
l´m writing all this down.
I have that thing with your teacher...

6
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:30,312
...then l´m working late. So you´lI have to
take care of yourseIf for dinner, okay?

7
00:03:31,188 --> 00:03:32,898
-Okay?
-Okay.

8
00:03:37,694 --> 00:03:40,448
I thought you wanted to get up by 7:30.

9
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:56,714
Hear the chains sing?

10
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:58,632
Check that up, man.

11
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:01,844
Hold on. What up, J? Where you been?

12
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,221
Asleep, yo.

13
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:07,224
I was up late
wondering how l´d save your ass out here.

14
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:09,184
What are you saving?

15
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:12,730
J, break him up, man.

16
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:21,738
You can´t give him that.

17
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:24,616
-You can´t give him that.
-l´m awake now.

18
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:30,914
You got something for me?

19
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:32,958
Soufflé, baby!

20
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:39,840
You got nothing for me.

21
00:04:40,257 --> 00:04:42,509
A lot of good that´s doing.

22
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:47,764
He´s bringing something for the Window.

23
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:50,267
-You ever seen him?
-The Window?

24
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:52,853
No, but he see us, man.

25
00:04:58,276 --> 00:04:59,776
Come on, man.

26
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:03,155
What´s wrong with y´all?
Don´t you want to play ball?

27
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:05,240
Wake up.

28
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:12,832
In 1845...

29
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,376
...Poe wrote his most famous piece,
The Raven.

30
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:20,965
A poem he wrote while he was strung out
on coke and obsessed with death.

31
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:23,800
The Raven is like the football team.

32
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,346
They´re obsessed with death,
always get their ass kicked.

33
00:05:28,305 --> 00:05:32,310
Baltimore Ravens: only pro football team
named after a classic poem.

34
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:34,561
Anyone read it?

35
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:37,648
´´Once upon a midnight dreary

36
00:05:38,815 --> 00:05:41,401
´´while I pondered weak and weary´"

37
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,781
Jamal, how about it?

38
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:50,619
I never read it.

39
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:55,707
Okay, I need those essays by next Tuesday.

40
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,342
My dad saw the Window, man.
About 20 years ago.

41
00:06:05,342 --> 00:06:09,179
Standing there like a ghost,
like the ones in our science books.

42
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:10,347
Just like that, man.

43
00:06:10,347 --> 00:06:12,348
-He was white?
-Ain´t milk white?

44
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:14,351
What ghost isn´t white?

45
00:06:14,351 --> 00:06:15,853
l´m just playing, man.

46
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:18,855
I heard he killed someone.
That´s why he stays inside.

47
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:21,358
Listen, you got to kill an army
to have to hide here.

48
00:06:21,358 --> 00:06:25,654
Y´all play too much. Remember Shurrita?
The one who lived below the Window?

49
00:06:27,364 --> 00:06:30,367
She calls me up
this one night buggin´, dog.

50
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:35,372
Saying how she heard a tapping sound
coming from the Window´s place.

51
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:37,291
Tap....

52
00:06:40,877 --> 00:06:44,130
While she was on the phone,
she started screaming.

53
00:06:44,381 --> 00:06:48,010
´Cause now the tapping has made its way
downstairs somehow.

54
00:06:48,385 --> 00:06:49,803
Tap....

55
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,392
And now it was on the other side
of her door.

56
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:59,813
She could tell he was tapping
with some kind of knife.

57
00:07:00,397 --> 00:07:04,610
And then the phone disconnected.
That was the last time we seen Shurrita.

58
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:07,570
Shurrita who lived across the street?

59
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:10,407
That girl is a crack ho.

60
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:12,242
No, she was nice.

61
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:15,036
All I know is the Window´s bad news.

62
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:16,412
Rules was...

63
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:19,416
...if you went outside, you stayed away
from the Window´s place.

64
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,918
We need to stay away from your lying ass.

65
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:23,420
You believe me, right?

66
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,463
You full of shit, dog.

67
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:27,257
Damn.

68
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:30,301
Let me guess. You´d go up in there, right?

69
00:07:31,427 --> 00:07:33,430
lt´s an old man looking out a window.

70
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,932
You´d go up there, right?

71
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:37,434
-He won´t go.
-Let them know, J.

72
00:07:37,934 --> 00:07:40,562
-He won´t go.
-This nigga´s scared.

73
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:43,064
Yo, I got the next call.

74
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,066
-So?
-So...

75
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:47,943
...I dare you to go up there, right?

76
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:49,321
Right?

77
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:52,657
Whatever, man. l´ll go up there. Yeah.

78
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:53,950
-He´s going.
-Big shot.

79
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,452
Bring it on.

80
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:57,162
That´s my dog.

81
00:07:58,454 --> 00:08:00,498
D, I believe you, dog.

82
00:08:00,957 --> 00:08:03,500
Shut up. Go to class or something.

83
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,129
Here, man. Sit over here.

84
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:09,966
-Stop playing with me.
-This is my birthday.

85
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:10,967
Go over there.

86
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:14,261
-Fine. I won´t sit near you.
-Take your apple, too.

87
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:24,499
-Miss Joyce?
-Yeah.

88
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:28,544
-Good to see you.
-You, too. Come, sit down.

89
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:34,508
We got Jamal´s test scores back.

90
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,053
-Test scores?
-Assessment tests.

91
00:09:37,053 --> 00:09:39,931
All of the kids are required to take them.

92
00:09:41,057 --> 00:09:43,310
He didn´t tell you, did he?

93
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:48,064
Mrs. Wallace,
Jamal maintains a C average...

94
00:09:48,565 --> 00:09:52,777
...which means he does enough to get by
and just enough not to stand out.

95
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,447
What makes Jamal´s case unusual
are his test results.

96
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,665
Oh, my God.

97
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:10,879
I see him reading these books all the time.
Books I never read.

98
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:15,758
Some l´ve never even heard of.
And he´s always writing in his notebooks.

99
00:10:16,593 --> 00:10:19,845
Ever since his father left.
But that´s what I see.

100
00:10:21,597 --> 00:10:24,309
All he ever talks about is basketball.

101
00:10:25,101 --> 00:10:28,021
Basketball is where he gets his acceptance.

102
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:31,107
The kids here don´t care about
what he can write.

103
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:33,693
Let´s go! Between the yellow lines!

104
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:35,110
Yo, T.

105
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,613
-How are you, Fly?
-Maintaining.

106
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:42,118
You looking for tickets, little bro?

107
00:10:42,118 --> 00:10:44,538
Dead tonight. Sorry about that.

108
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:46,622
Come on. We know you got tickets.

109
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:48,624
I got four words for you:

110
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:50,500
Boss Tunn Red Sox.

111
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:56,173
The Yanks and Sox tickets
have been sold out for a month.

112
00:10:56,632 --> 00:10:58,926
Okay, Mr. Fly? By the way...

113
00:10:59,135 --> 00:11:02,847
...go tell Camry boy there
to back up his cheap-ass bumper...

114
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,642
...on that Mercedes over there.

115
00:11:06,642 --> 00:11:09,019
Go handle that. Let´s go, Fly!

116
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:13,649
What the hell, Jamal? Mom called.

117
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,153
-Told me about that test. What´s up?
-Nothing.

118
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:19,154
What do you mean, ´´nothing´´?

119
00:11:19,154 --> 00:11:21,657
This getting in the way
of your plans or something?

120
00:11:21,657 --> 00:11:23,868
lt was your plan first, T.

121
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:26,662
Yeah, I know. A little college ball...

122
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:30,499
...then start signing checks for everyone,
solve their problems.

123
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,085
Look at me, though.

124
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:37,381
Hold a minute.

125
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:40,967
Hold onto these.

126
00:11:42,177 --> 00:11:44,764
I guess this makes it our plan now.

127
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:47,224
One thing.

128
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:51,187
Don´t tell nobody about them test scores.

129
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:53,188
Don´t worry. l´m your brother, dog.

130
00:11:53,188 --> 00:11:55,858
Whatever we discuss stays between us.

131
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:59,195
Love you, dog. All right?

132
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:01,322
Just remember one thing.

133
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:05,743
Mom will know when the game ends,
so you take your ass straight home.

134
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:10,580
Don´t get into no trouble, man. Be careful.
Stay safe. Love, dog.

135
00:12:11,206 --> 00:12:14,085
-Okay, T. Good lookin´.
-Be careful, man.

136
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:17,088
lt stinks in here.

137
00:12:17,213 --> 00:12:20,716
J, see that window?
He keeps that one cracked sometimes.

138
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:23,719
The light´s been out for two hours.

139
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,221
You sure he asleep?

140
00:12:25,221 --> 00:12:28,974
That Methuselah´s a thousand years old.
That´s all he ever do.

141
00:12:30,226 --> 00:12:33,270
Yo, J, for the reals, I don´t know about this.

142
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,648
I think l´m-- Shit!

143
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:40,069
I think l´m pulling the call.

144
00:12:40,235 --> 00:12:42,529
-No, I got this one.
-Rats.

145
00:12:43,738 --> 00:12:47,035
-Yo, Fly.
-Keep it. You got to bring something out.

146
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,287
Man, you hear us, drop down, okay?

147
00:12:51,247 --> 00:12:52,582
Okay.

148
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:55,584
Don´t stay in there too long.

149
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,294
I got you.

150
00:12:59,254 --> 00:13:01,048
This is rickety.

151
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:05,398
Oh, shit! Yo, you got something?

152
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,942
-Shit!
-What happened?

153
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:09,444
You son of a bitch!

154
00:16:09,444 --> 00:16:11,446
Dickheads, he wasn´t asleep.

155
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:13,949
-Did you see him?
-Not for long.

156
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:21,831
Stop bouncing that damn ball in the house.

157
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:26,461
I got Michael Jordan´s name
written in dirt all over my floor.

158
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:27,963
Don´t worry, l´ll clean it.

159
00:16:27,963 --> 00:16:30,966
I got a better chance
of Michael Jordan cleaning it.

160
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:34,469
If you´re thinking of a shower,
the hot water´s a bit slow.

161
00:16:34,469 --> 00:16:37,513
-I wasn´t thinking of it.
-Where´s your pack?

162
00:16:40,476 --> 00:16:42,936
-I don´t know.
-´´Don´t know´´?

163
00:16:43,478 --> 00:16:45,981
What do you mean, you don´t know?

164
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:48,983
We wanted you to bring something,
not leave something.

165
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:50,985
Why don´t you leave it alone?

166
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:52,988
What was in your bag?

167
00:16:53,988 --> 00:16:56,575
l´m not talking about the damn bag.

168
00:16:56,992 --> 00:16:58,786
I bet you ain´t.

169
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:01,955
Let me teach you something.
Watch the eyes.

170
00:17:02,497 --> 00:17:04,916
He´s probably watching you now.

171
00:17:08,503 --> 00:17:11,882
You don´t know about that, man.
Here´s how you do it.

172
00:18:10,064 --> 00:18:12,524
I won´t do anything to your car.

173
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:13,944
Sorry?

174
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:16,572
You look worried,
like l´ll do something to your car.

175
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:20,241
I worry about this car everywhere.
Don´t take it personally.

176
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:22,077
lt´s just a car, man.

177
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:24,870
No, it´s not ´´just a car.´´ lt´s a BMW.

178
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,582
Anyone who knows anything
about that company...

179
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:31,086
...knows that it´s more than ´´just a car.´"

180
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:33,589
Anybody who knows about that company?

181
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:36,090
So I wouldn´t know anything like that.

182
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,384
No, that´s not what I meant.

183
00:18:39,094 --> 00:18:41,470
Last thing I knew about BMW...

184
00:18:41,595 --> 00:18:44,600
...was it made plane engines
when it first started.

185
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,727
A guy by the name of Franz Popp
started it all.

186
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:50,938
Franz Popp. I like that name.

187
00:18:52,106 --> 00:18:55,568
Made this one engine before 1920.
lt flew six miles up.

188
00:18:57,611 --> 00:19:00,616
Popp and his boys
were just getting started.

189
00:19:00,616 --> 00:19:04,494
They made this one engine, the 801,
World War ll, 14 cylinders...

190
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:07,247
...2,300 horsepower, seven miles up.

191
00:19:10,124 --> 00:19:13,627
With more time, they´d have bombed
the shit out of England...

192
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:15,839
...maybe even won the war.

193
00:19:16,631 --> 00:19:18,966
That´s where this comes from.

194
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:22,011
White propeller zipping around a blue sky.

195
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:26,140
After the war, we told them
they couldn´t make plane engines.

196
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,685
That´s when BMW
gave some serious thought to making cars.

197
00:19:31,646 --> 00:19:33,648
Kind of like this one.

198
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:36,984
You probably knew all that,
seeing as you lease one.

199
00:19:37,151 --> 00:19:39,529
Thanks for the history lesson.

200
00:19:40,155 --> 00:19:41,947
No problem, man.

201
00:21:00,234 --> 00:21:02,486
Messin´ with my stuff, man.

202
00:21:59,794 --> 00:22:01,294
The other night was....

203
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:04,381
lt was just this dare thing
me and my boys do.

204
00:22:21,815 --> 00:22:25,319
I was wondering
if I could bring you more of my stuff...

205
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,322
...or maybe I could write something else.

206
00:22:28,322 --> 00:22:32,201
How about 5,000 words on
why you´ll stay the fuck out of my home?

207
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:18,538
Come on, man. I know you´re in there.

208
00:23:22,376 --> 00:23:24,961
Take your goddamn hand off my door.

209
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,090
I just came...

210
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:31,301
...to drop off that thing you asked me for.

211
00:23:31,385 --> 00:23:32,970
What thing?

212
00:23:33,387 --> 00:23:37,182
The 5,000 words on why you wanted me
to stay out of your place.

213
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,393
That´s kind of what you said.

214
00:23:39,393 --> 00:23:42,479
Well, try remembering it
exactly as I said it.

215
00:24:12,425 --> 00:24:13,928
Come on in, Jamal.

216
00:24:13,928 --> 00:24:15,470
Hi, honey.

217
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,973
lt´s okay.

218
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:20,433
Sit down.

219
00:24:21,434 --> 00:24:25,063
Mrs. Wallace, Jamal,
when we got your recent test scores...

220
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:28,943
...we thought the private schools
might show some interest.

221
00:24:28,943 --> 00:24:30,903
Well, we were right.

222
00:24:32,946 --> 00:24:35,783
-Mr. Bradley.
-My name is David Bradley.

223
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,452
l´m with the Mailor School in Manhattan.

224
00:24:39,452 --> 00:24:41,163
Mailor-Callow?

225
00:24:41,455 --> 00:24:43,957
That´s right. You´re familiar with us?

226
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:45,292
Yeah.

227
00:24:45,459 --> 00:24:49,171
Mailor-Callow is not only
the best prep school in the city...

228
00:24:49,463 --> 00:24:52,466
...it´s one of the finest private schools
on the East Coast.

229
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:53,967
Only the best go there.

230
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:56,469
We´re a few weeks into our fall term...

231
00:24:56,469 --> 00:25:00,557
...but every year we hold some openings
until the test scores come in.

232
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:04,936
Jamal, your test scores, to put it mildly...

233
00:25:05,478 --> 00:25:07,606
...caught our attention.

234
00:25:08,482 --> 00:25:12,277
l´m here to see if you´d be interested
in attending our school.

235
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,995
Leaving for another school,
especially a private one, won´t be easy.

236
00:25:20,995 --> 00:25:24,122
But this isn´t the right place
for you anymore.

237
00:25:24,998 --> 00:25:26,999
lt´s not a difficult choice.

238
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:28,709
Mr. Bradley...

239
00:25:30,003 --> 00:25:32,839
...there is no way we could pay for this.

240
00:25:33,006 --> 00:25:35,133
We´re not asking you to.

241
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:39,012
When Dr. Simon said
only the best go to Mailor...

242
00:25:39,012 --> 00:25:43,308
...he forgot to say our commitment
to excellence goes beyond the classroom.

243
00:25:44,016 --> 00:25:46,812
-I figured that.
-We thought you might.

244
00:25:47,021 --> 00:25:50,982
Mrs. Wallace, 40 of our students
have gone on to play college ball.

245
00:25:52,025 --> 00:25:55,570
Three have made it to professional level.
We evaluated...

246
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:59,532
...your play last year
and while this is a strictly academic offer...

247
00:25:59,532 --> 00:26:02,327
...we won´t be disappointed if you play.

248
00:26:02,536 --> 00:26:05,997
All we ask is you come out,
take a look, think it over.

249
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,042
-Okay.
-Mrs. Wallace.

250
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:11,003
-Thank you.
-Jamal.

251
00:26:12,044 --> 00:26:14,464
-Good-bye.
-We´ll be in touch.

252
00:27:03,596 --> 00:27:05,098
I didn´t knock this time.

253
00:27:05,098 --> 00:27:09,269
-To whom were you speaking?
-l´ll tell you if I get my 5,000 words back.

254
00:27:50,643 --> 00:27:53,188
Bolt the door if you´re coming in.

255
00:28:00,153 --> 00:28:02,071
The man in the car?

256
00:28:07,661 --> 00:28:10,121
He was from this private school.

257
00:28:11,164 --> 00:28:13,333
They want me to go there.

258
00:28:16,168 --> 00:28:18,880
We don´t have to pay anything, though.

259
00:28:20,672 --> 00:28:23,802
My mom and I live
a couple of blocks from here.

260
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:30,183
My brother was there a few years ago,
but he left after my dad left.

261
00:28:46,699 --> 00:28:50,035
My mom got tired of waiting
for my dad to get clean.

262
00:28:51,203 --> 00:28:53,622
And my dad got tired of trying.

263
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:57,210
That´s when I started writing.

264
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,044
What´s your name?

265
00:28:59,211 --> 00:29:00,922
Jamal Wallace.

266
00:29:01,214 --> 00:29:03,800
Sounds like some kind of marmalade.

267
00:29:04,716 --> 00:29:06,510
How old are you?

268
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:08,637
l´m 16.

269
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:10,181
Sixteen?

270
00:29:11,224 --> 00:29:13,059
And you´re black.

271
00:29:16,228 --> 00:29:18,814
-lt´s remarkable.
-´´Remarkable´´?

272
00:29:19,732 --> 00:29:24,111
lt´s remarkable l´m black? What does me
being black have to do with anything?

273
00:29:29,742 --> 00:29:32,745
You don´t know what to do right now,
do you?

274
00:29:32,745 --> 00:29:36,749
If you say what you really want to,
I may not read any more of this.

275
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:41,379
But if you let me run you down
with this racist bullshit...

276
00:29:43,756 --> 00:29:46,008
...what does that make you?

277
00:29:50,262 --> 00:29:52,681
l´m not playing this game, man.

278
00:29:53,265 --> 00:29:55,433
I say you are playing it.

279
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:58,563
An expression is worth a thousand words.

280
00:30:01,273 --> 00:30:03,693
Perhaps in your case, just two.

281
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:10,616
Here.

282
00:30:27,801 --> 00:30:29,593
Bum-ass old man.

283
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:39,644
´´One hand to give, one to receive,
as we eat together in unity.

284
00:30:40,312 --> 00:30:43,483
´´May our minds,
bodies and spirits grow strong.

285
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:47,069
´´And congratulations to Jamal. Amen.´"

286
00:30:49,822 --> 00:30:51,323
Did you see this?

287
00:30:51,323 --> 00:30:53,784
-Let me see.
-Don´t mess it up.

288
00:30:54,827 --> 00:30:55,828
Wait.

289
00:30:55,828 --> 00:30:58,830
From the cover,
this looks like the funny-man school to me.

290
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,834
Terrell, eat your food.

291
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:04,253
You´ll be fine.
Mommy don´t make nothing but soldiers.

292
00:31:04,336 --> 00:31:06,339
You could have done the same thing.

293
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:09,925
I work at a parking lot,
and l´m no regular lot attendant.

294
00:31:10,342 --> 00:31:13,762
I am the supervisor
of all the parking lot attendants.

295
00:31:13,845 --> 00:31:16,849
You never know how much you´ll make
from week to week.

296
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:19,351
One week it´s $50, the next it´s $100.

297
00:31:19,351 --> 00:31:21,854
-That´s not a real job.
-Ma, leave him alone.

298
00:31:21,854 --> 00:31:24,689
I rap. You know I got my rap thing going.

299
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:27,860
Don´t bring up the rap. Eat your food.

300
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,861
-Want to hear a song?
-Eat your food.

301
00:31:29,861 --> 00:31:31,364
l´ll sing it for you.

302
00:31:31,364 --> 00:31:33,866
´´When I come due
When I blow the spot

303
00:31:33,866 --> 00:31:36,994
´´Your son, the supervisor
Of the parking lot´´

304
00:31:38,871 --> 00:31:41,623
Tell it, Jamal, my voice is hot, right?

305
00:32:28,295 --> 00:32:30,005
Jamal Wallace?

306
00:32:30,297 --> 00:32:32,715
-Yeah?
-Hi. l´m Claire Spence.

307
00:32:35,303 --> 00:32:37,930
Bradley asked me to show you around.

308
00:32:38,305 --> 00:32:39,848
All right.

309
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,270
Come on.

310
00:32:55,822 --> 00:32:58,158
Besides, the teachers here...

311
00:32:58,325 --> 00:33:01,202
...aren´t that into student participation.

312
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:03,330
They prefer to hear themselves talk.

313
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,791
-What do you mean?
-You´lI see.

314
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:10,253
This morning, we begin
our third required reading of the semester.

315
00:33:10,337 --> 00:33:12,839
The study of a novel
that offers everything...

316
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:16,092
...and an author
who could have offered much more.

317
00:33:20,348 --> 00:33:24,351
That´s Robert Crawford. He´s been here
as long as most of the buildings.

318
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:27,187
When William Forrester was 23, in 1953...

319
00:33:28,355 --> 00:33:31,066
...he set out to write his first book.

320
00:33:31,358 --> 00:33:35,529
Many aspiring authors talked about
writing the great 20th century novel.

321
00:33:36,864 --> 00:33:39,116
William Forrester did it...

322
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:40,868
...on his first try.

323
00:33:40,868 --> 00:33:42,786
Have you read this?

324
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,913
Yeah. You?

325
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:47,374
Only about a dozen times.

326
00:33:47,374 --> 00:33:50,334
This was the only book
he chose to publish.

327
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:53,839
For all we know,
it was the only one he chose to write.

328
00:33:55,382 --> 00:33:58,969
Your job over the next week
is to read it and tell me why.

329
00:33:59,386 --> 00:34:00,720
So...

330
00:34:01,888 --> 00:34:03,890
...will you be back tomorrow?

331
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,893
Yeah. They want me to spend some time
on the court.

332
00:34:06,893 --> 00:34:08,353
I heard.

333
00:34:08,395 --> 00:34:11,648
Graduation was a little rough
on last year´s team.

334
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,943
But it´s just like college, right?

335
00:34:15,402 --> 00:34:18,613
You get an education
and they get what they want.

336
00:34:18,905 --> 00:34:20,907
Maybe you both get what you want.

337
00:34:20,907 --> 00:34:22,285
Maybe.

338
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:27,039
lt was very nice meeting you, Jamal.

339
00:34:27,414 --> 00:34:30,417
You, too, Claire.
Will you be around tomorrow?

340
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:32,669
Not where you´ll be, but...

341
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:35,338
...you might find me for lunch.

342
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:46,683
-I didn´t say those two words yesterday.
-Why not?

343
00:34:47,434 --> 00:34:50,061
I want you to read more of my stuff.

344
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:56,568
They talk a lot about you out there.

345
00:34:57,444 --> 00:34:59,446
All this legend bullshit.

346
00:34:59,446 --> 00:35:03,074
They got some stories.
People wonder if you killed someone.

347
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,453
That, and wondering why
you been in here so long.

348
00:35:06,453 --> 00:35:10,123
I wouldn´t move. lt´s quiet.
You don´t hear nothing in here.

349
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,877
Our place has noisy neighbours.

350
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:17,464
Their kid is always yelling,
´cause he´s a year old...

351
00:35:17,464 --> 00:35:19,966
...or pops yells
´cause the kid is making noise.

352
00:35:19,966 --> 00:35:24,678
Then mom, on top of that, is yelling.
But it´s a different kind of yelling, ´cause...

353
00:35:25,472 --> 00:35:29,976
...the old man´s playing tunes for her and
she´s banging her head against the wall...

354
00:35:29,976 --> 00:35:32,103
...and she´s screaming--

355
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:34,689
You better stir that soup.

356
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:36,816
What?

357
00:35:37,984 --> 00:35:40,488
Stir the soup before it firms up.

358
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:49,996
Why doesn´t ours get anything on it?

359
00:35:49,996 --> 00:35:51,790
Come on. Closer.

360
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:54,500
Now.

361
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,503
You got someone
doing that kind of yelling?

362
00:35:56,503 --> 00:35:59,422
What I have is an adult male. Quite pretty.

363
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:04,427
Probably strayed from the park.

364
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:11,559
A Connecticut warbler.

365
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:14,729
You ever go outside to do any of this?

366
00:36:15,522 --> 00:36:18,525
You should have stayed
with the soup question.

367
00:36:18,525 --> 00:36:22,779
The object of a question is to obtain
information that matters only to us.

368
00:36:26,031 --> 00:36:29,244
You were wondering
why your soup doesn´t firm up?

369
00:36:29,536 --> 00:36:32,538
Probably because your mother
was brought up in a house...

370
00:36:32,538 --> 00:36:35,041
...that never wasted milk in soup.

371
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:39,295
That question was a good one,
in contrast to, ´´Do I ever go outside?´´...

372
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:46,595
...which fails to meet the criteria of
obtaining information that matters to you.

373
00:36:47,554 --> 00:36:51,057
All right. I guess I don´t have
any more soup questions.

374
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:53,809
No?

375
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:56,562
Why´d you say all that stuff
about me being black?

376
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:59,440
lt had nothing to do with you being black.

377
00:36:59,566 --> 00:37:03,111
I wanted to find out
how much bullshit you´d put up with.

378
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:06,072
-So you knew l´d come back?
-Yes.

379
00:37:06,072 --> 00:37:09,075
Just like I know
you´ll go to this new school.

380
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:10,076
How do you know?

381
00:37:10,076 --> 00:37:14,748
Because there´s a question in your writing
about what you wish to do with your life.

382
00:37:15,582 --> 00:37:19,294
That is a question your present school
cannot answer for you.

383
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,050
Let´s match up.
Wallace, you take Hartwell.

384
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:32,099
What´s up? l´m Jamal.

385
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:34,767
Just check it, all right?

386
00:37:37,604 --> 00:37:39,355
Check the ball.

387
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:41,065
Come on.

388
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:45,653
Ball´s in.

389
00:37:52,118 --> 00:37:53,870
Play him tough.

390
00:37:57,623 --> 00:37:59,417
Way to go, gang.

391
00:38:02,629 --> 00:38:04,756
D up. Let´s go, garbage.

392
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:06,590
Come on.

393
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:08,593
Step up.

394
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:17,144
Why don´t you leave
the trash-talking back home?

395
00:38:17,144 --> 00:38:19,938
What? Get that goofy look off your face.

396
00:38:20,647 --> 00:38:23,148
-l´m gonna make you my son right now.
-Right.

397
00:38:23,148 --> 00:38:25,610
-You gonna be my son.
-Come on.

398
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,161
Let´s go.

399
00:38:37,664 --> 00:38:39,665
-Come on, man.
-What?

400
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:41,500
You´re too small.

401
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:49,676
A little defence would be real nice.

402
00:38:49,676 --> 00:38:52,386
Coach, you´re right. A little defence.

403
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,682
-Try to get past the line.
-What?

404
00:38:55,682 --> 00:38:57,891
I said, get past the line.

405
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:01,187
Pressure.

406
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,191
Too much.

407
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:11,531
I need some help!

408
00:39:11,697 --> 00:39:14,324
Ten seconds. Let´s go the other way.

409
00:39:29,716 --> 00:39:31,216
-l´m taking your spot.
-What?

410
00:39:31,216 --> 00:39:33,218
-l´m taking your spot.
-You take nothing.

411
00:39:33,218 --> 00:39:34,678
Come on.

412
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:49,902
My court, babe. My court.

413
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:57,743
That´s how we play it down here.

414
00:39:57,743 --> 00:39:59,411
That´s right.

415
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:05,250
John Hartwell´s just a rich kid
who wants as much of the spotlight...

416
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,754
...as he can get in his senior year.
That´s all it is.

417
00:40:07,754 --> 00:40:11,674
-They take things real serious around here.
-lt´s a serious place.

418
00:40:13,259 --> 00:40:17,346
Serious enough that I end up here
getting lunch on my books most days.

419
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:20,640
What´s that you´re working on?

420
00:40:21,266 --> 00:40:23,102
Forrester´s book.

421
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:27,064
-You said you read it a dozen times.
-I know, but look at this.

422
00:40:27,273 --> 00:40:30,276
My dad got it for me. lt´s an early printing.

423
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:40,286
-Listen, I got to go.
-But you just got here!

424
00:40:40,286 --> 00:40:44,123
I know, but, I forgot something.
I got to check up on something.

425
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:48,209
l´lI see you later.

426
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:09,566
´´Born: 1930...

427
00:41:10,315 --> 00:41:12,234
´´...in Scotland.´"

428
00:41:20,326 --> 00:41:23,745
´´Moved to New York
with his family in his late teens.

429
00:41:24,831 --> 00:41:27,916
´´Mr. Forrester was unavailable
for comment.´´

430
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:30,753
Yeah, I bet he was.

431
00:41:30,795 --> 00:41:34,005
Are we now planning
to make these visits a habit?

432
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:37,843
You said you knew l´d come back.

433
00:41:37,843 --> 00:41:40,388
Yes, but I thought you meant once.

434
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:43,349
I need some help with a thing at school.

435
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:45,726
Yes. This ´´thing´´ at school.

436
00:41:46,351 --> 00:41:49,354
And what ´´thing´´
are we talking about now?

437
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,779
You ever read that?

438
00:42:01,366 --> 00:42:05,079
l´m trying. I just can´t seem to get past
the first 10 pages.

439
00:42:09,374 --> 00:42:11,084
As I recall...

440
00:42:12,377 --> 00:42:15,589
...it took awhile
to get past those pages myself.

441
00:42:18,383 --> 00:42:22,680
Christ, you´ve dog-eared one of them.
Show a little respect for the author.

442
00:42:29,394 --> 00:42:31,397
That´s you, isn´t it?

443
00:42:32,398 --> 00:42:34,274
You´re the author.

444
00:42:36,401 --> 00:42:40,029
I read the whole thing. lt´s not bad.
Especially the part--

445
00:42:41,906 --> 00:42:43,784
I know what it is.

446
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:47,412
The last thing I need is another person
telling me what they think it is.

447
00:42:47,412 --> 00:42:48,914
I wasn´t going to say that.

448
00:42:48,914 --> 00:42:52,834
What were you going to say?
I should tell you everything about me?

449
00:42:52,918 --> 00:42:54,419
I told you about me.

450
00:42:54,419 --> 00:42:57,839
You could learn a little something
about holding back.

451
00:43:31,957 --> 00:43:35,044
If I ask you not to say anything
to anybody...

452
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,921
...about here, us...

453
00:43:39,965 --> 00:43:42,759
...is that something I can trust you on?

454
00:43:47,472 --> 00:43:48,807
Yeah.

455
00:43:49,474 --> 00:43:51,018
I promise.

456
00:43:51,977 --> 00:43:53,311
Fine.

457
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,316
And if I ask you to keep helping me
with my writing?

458
00:44:12,998 --> 00:44:15,624
There´ll be no questions about me...

459
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,046
...my family,
or why there was only one book.

460
00:44:20,005 --> 00:44:21,840
Then I won´t ask.

461
00:44:23,008 --> 00:44:24,343
Good.

462
00:44:24,509 --> 00:44:26,260
And good night.

463
00:44:36,522 --> 00:44:38,481
What´s it feel like?

464
00:44:39,524 --> 00:44:40,525
What?

465
00:44:40,525 --> 00:44:43,069
Writing something the way you did.

466
00:44:44,529 --> 00:44:46,656
Perhaps you´ll find out.

467
00:45:03,549 --> 00:45:05,925
Listen, you 5-foot nothing....

468
00:45:08,053 --> 00:45:10,471
That´s what l´m saying, though.

469
00:45:13,558 --> 00:45:15,060
Kenzo, how old are you?

470
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,352
Why?

471
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,565
Look at your face!
Your mom didn´t do that to you?

472
00:45:19,565 --> 00:45:21,566
She started you young.

473
00:45:21,566 --> 00:45:24,861
Know where that comes from?
Eating too much cookie.

474
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:29,323
Teresa told me.

475
00:45:29,574 --> 00:45:32,577
I like ´em big.
You got a problem with that?

476
00:45:32,577 --> 00:45:35,497
-Nothing wrong with a big girl!
-That big?

477
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:40,001
lt don´t make a difference. lt´s like
when l´m with all three of your mothers.

478
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:41,586
-Not my mother.
-Yeah.

479
00:45:41,586 --> 00:45:43,879
Hold on, Oscar Mayer wiener.

480
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:48,718
Stop playing, man. You got beat like Tina
in school one day. I seen Duke smack you.

481
00:45:49,093 --> 00:45:53,140
Listen, throw it at your mama.
Every day, throw it towards your mama.

482
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:56,601
Your mama. Stop throwing your mama.

483
00:45:56,601 --> 00:45:59,020
lt´s all in your tank, brother.

484
00:45:59,104 --> 00:46:00,604
Why you laughing?

485
00:46:00,604 --> 00:46:03,399
Man, your glasses are like Coke bottles.

486
00:46:05,611 --> 00:46:07,111
Classics.

487
00:46:08,613 --> 00:46:11,575
-You ever met somebody famous?
-How famous?

488
00:46:12,116 --> 00:46:14,369
Like, I don´t know, like...

489
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,997
...somebody people would know.

490
00:46:18,122 --> 00:46:20,917
Nobody like that comes around here, man.

491
00:46:24,629 --> 00:46:26,840
Are you here for good now?

492
00:46:27,632 --> 00:46:30,301
Yeah. l´m just trying to get started.

493
00:46:34,138 --> 00:46:36,557
At least they look good, right?

494
00:46:48,653 --> 00:46:53,158
You´ll all be pleased to know this year´s
writing competition has been scheduled.

495
00:46:53,158 --> 00:46:56,161
For those choosing to take part,
all entries must be turned in...

496
00:46:56,161 --> 00:47:00,748
...before spring break, which means you
have a few months of procrastination left.

497
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:06,128
Feel free to experiment
with a more proactive approach.

498
00:47:09,674 --> 00:47:11,301
Mr. Wallace?

499
00:47:11,676 --> 00:47:13,095
Please.

500
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:19,141
I had a chance to review the files
sent over by your former school.

501
00:47:21,685 --> 00:47:23,688
Test scores, impressive.

502
00:47:23,688 --> 00:47:26,524
Actual classroom work, not so impressive.

503
00:47:28,193 --> 00:47:31,278
ls this the level of work
I should anticipate?

504
00:47:37,201 --> 00:47:39,161
Because, if it is...

505
00:47:40,205 --> 00:47:44,083
...it will help me determine
whether to treat you as a student...

506
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:47,962
...or as someone who is here to pursue,
how should I put it...

507
00:47:48,712 --> 00:47:50,673
...other endeavours?

508
00:47:51,716 --> 00:47:55,553
Of course, your work will give you
ample opportunity to respond.

509
00:47:57,723 --> 00:47:59,765
Good day, Mr. Wallace.

510
00:48:05,729 --> 00:48:08,940
Just so you know,
you handled that the right way.

511
00:48:09,232 --> 00:48:10,860
How is that?

512
00:48:11,236 --> 00:48:14,822
You didn´t say anything.
The ones who do run into trouble.

513
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:18,242
-John Coleridge.
-Jamal Wallace.

514
00:48:21,245 --> 00:48:23,747
So, how many people do say something?

515
00:48:23,747 --> 00:48:26,918
And actually stay in Crawford´s class?
Not many.

516
00:48:29,254 --> 00:48:31,338
I missed what you said.

517
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:34,300
I didn´t say anything.

518
00:48:38,762 --> 00:48:40,681
You read all these?

519
00:48:40,764 --> 00:48:43,935
No, I just keep them
to impress all my visitors.

520
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:47,647
All your visitors.

521
00:48:48,272 --> 00:48:50,775
We´ve been talking
about your book at school.

522
00:48:50,775 --> 00:48:55,445
People have been talking about it for years.
They just haven´t been saying anything.

523
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,283
I think I got it down, though.

524
00:48:58,283 --> 00:49:01,786
I figure you were writing about
how life never works out.

525
00:49:01,786 --> 00:49:05,038
Really? You had to read a book
to figure that out?

526
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,502
But Crawford´s messed up on it anyhow.

527
00:49:10,294 --> 00:49:13,298
He says the guy having trouble
after the war is really you.

528
00:49:13,298 --> 00:49:17,468
Some symbolism shit for all the problems
you were having with everybody.

529
00:49:18,302 --> 00:49:20,096
Robert Crawford?

530
00:49:20,304 --> 00:49:24,642
Yeah. I think it´s bullshit, though.
I think there really was somebody else.

531
00:49:32,317 --> 00:49:34,026
Mr. Johannsen?

532
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:35,653
Here.

533
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:39,281
Mr. Massie.
Another trip to your favourite destination.

534
00:49:40,324 --> 00:49:42,826
l´ve got four bags.
I can just leave them if you like.

535
00:49:42,826 --> 00:49:44,077
No.

536
00:49:46,831 --> 00:49:48,541
Come right in.

537
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:50,834
How you doing, Mr. Johannsen?

538
00:49:50,834 --> 00:49:53,337
lt´s at least a haIf hour before the sun sets.

539
00:49:53,337 --> 00:49:57,049
Then you can begin
your panic-driven quest back to Manhattan.

540
00:49:58,342 --> 00:50:00,844
This should last you till next week.

541
00:50:00,844 --> 00:50:03,014
Your mail is in this one.

542
00:50:03,848 --> 00:50:05,349
Mr. Johannsen?

543
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:07,851
-The essentials are in--
-Essentials?

544
00:50:07,851 --> 00:50:11,522
I took care of your bills.
I put all the copies in this one.

545
00:50:12,355 --> 00:50:15,860
The phone company wants to know
if you want to continue service...

546
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:18,862
...seeing as you haven´t had a call
in about--

547
00:50:18,862 --> 00:50:22,575
I got your socks for the next few weeks.
They´re in this one.

548
00:50:23,366 --> 00:50:26,203
I have your latest check from accounting.

549
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:31,124
They want to know if you cashed
the last one. lt´s showing up outstanding.

550
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:33,920
Not as outstanding as it once was.

551
00:50:38,883 --> 00:50:41,885
l´m sorry.
I didn´t realise you had company.

552
00:50:41,885 --> 00:50:44,596
We were just having a discussion on...

553
00:50:45,388 --> 00:50:48,476
...German automobile history.
Care to join us?

554
00:50:49,393 --> 00:50:52,437
-No, l´m in the tow-away.
-Of course you are.

555
00:50:52,896 --> 00:50:54,398
See you next week?

556
00:50:54,398 --> 00:50:56,233
Not if l´m lucky.

557
00:51:01,905 --> 00:51:05,409
Why don´t you give that guy a break
and do your own shopping?

558
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:07,412
Why are your socks inside out?

559
00:51:07,412 --> 00:51:08,912
Socks are badly designed.

560
00:51:08,912 --> 00:51:12,082
The seams are on the inside.
They hurt the toes.

561
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:17,170
In some cultures, it´s good luck
to wear something inside out.

562
00:51:17,921 --> 00:51:19,423
You believe that?

563
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:22,426
No. But it´s like praying.
What do you risk?

564
00:51:22,927 --> 00:51:26,763
And I do go outside. How do you think
those windows get cleaned?

565
00:51:29,932 --> 00:51:32,519
Now, about this professor of yours.

566
00:51:33,938 --> 00:51:37,357
How did it feel having him tell you
what you can´t do?

567
00:51:38,442 --> 00:51:40,444
Like he knew he was better than me.

568
00:51:40,444 --> 00:51:43,071
Then let´s show him what you can do.

569
00:51:44,448 --> 00:51:46,949
Why is it the words we write
for ourselves...

570
00:51:46,949 --> 00:51:51,038
...are always so much better
than the words we write for others? Move.

571
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:55,751
Sit.

572
00:52:05,469 --> 00:52:06,971
Go ahead.

573
00:52:07,972 --> 00:52:09,472
Go ahead and what?

574
00:52:09,472 --> 00:52:10,849
Write.

575
00:52:12,976 --> 00:52:14,478
What are you doing?

576
00:52:14,478 --> 00:52:18,315
l´m writing. Like you´ll be,
when you start punching those keys.

577
00:52:24,989 --> 00:52:26,489
ls there a problem?

578
00:52:26,489 --> 00:52:28,533
No. l´m just thinking.

579
00:52:28,992 --> 00:52:31,369
No thinking. That comes later.

580
00:52:35,498 --> 00:52:37,834
You write your first draft...

581
00:52:38,502 --> 00:52:40,421
...with your heart.

582
00:52:40,504 --> 00:52:42,756
You rewrite with your head.

583
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:49,387
The first key to writing is...

584
00:52:50,513 --> 00:52:52,141
...to write.

585
00:52:52,516 --> 00:52:54,184
Not to think.

586
00:53:04,528 --> 00:53:05,903
Jesus.

587
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:45,735
ls there a chance you might sit down?

588
00:54:03,586 --> 00:54:06,714
´´A Season of Faith´s Pefection.´"
What´s this?

589
00:54:07,089 --> 00:54:08,966
Start typing that.

590
00:54:09,092 --> 00:54:13,263
Sometimes the simple rhythm of typing
gets us from page one to page two.

591
00:54:15,098 --> 00:54:18,643
When you begin to feel your own words,
start typing them.

592
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:44,002
Punch the keys for God´s sake!

593
00:54:54,137 --> 00:54:55,430
Yes!

594
00:54:59,643 --> 00:55:01,770
You´re the man now, dog.

595
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:07,085
Jamal?

596
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:10,421
Whatever we write in this apartment...

597
00:56:11,213 --> 00:56:13,466
...stays in this apartment.

598
00:56:14,217 --> 00:56:15,927
No exceptions.

599
00:56:47,876 --> 00:56:50,086
Okay, let´s push it, guys.

600
00:56:56,384 --> 00:56:59,386
-That´s a foul.
-What do you mean? I had the spot.

601
00:56:59,386 --> 00:57:01,889
l´ll let you know when you got the spot.

602
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:06,644
Gentlemen, our season begins in one week.
If I see this kind of thing one more time...

603
00:57:07,395 --> 00:57:10,564
...l´lI have you shooting fouls
to see who runs.

604
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:12,817
ls that understood?

605
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,193
One.

606
00:57:20,408 --> 00:57:21,700
Two.

607
00:57:25,413 --> 00:57:26,789
Three.

608
00:57:30,417 --> 00:57:31,836
Eleven.

609
00:57:35,924 --> 00:57:37,342
Twelve.

610
00:57:40,428 --> 00:57:41,929
Thirteen.

611
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:45,557
Twenty-nine.

612
00:57:53,942 --> 00:57:55,567
Forty-eight.

613
00:57:58,946 --> 00:58:00,531
Forty-nine.

614
00:58:05,453 --> 00:58:06,912
Hold it.

615
00:58:08,956 --> 00:58:10,458
One more.

616
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:27,058
That was one of the most
impressive things l´ve ever seen.

617
00:58:27,975 --> 00:58:30,978
Why do I know it wasn´t good enough
for either one of you?

618
00:58:30,978 --> 00:58:33,355
Shower up and get out of here.

619
00:58:35,983 --> 00:58:38,778
You may think we´re the same. We´re not.

620
00:58:46,493 --> 00:58:48,120
Mr. Wallace?

621
00:58:49,997 --> 00:58:51,624
Mr. Wallace.

622
00:58:51,999 --> 00:58:53,000
Professor.

623
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,503
The latest paper you turned in...

624
00:58:57,504 --> 00:59:01,008
...displayed quite a bit of improvement
from your earlier work.

625
00:59:01,008 --> 00:59:02,884
-Thank you.
-Yes.

626
00:59:03,009 --> 00:59:05,012
How long did it take to write?

627
00:59:05,012 --> 00:59:06,513
I wrote it last night.

628
00:59:06,513 --> 00:59:08,098
Last night.

629
00:59:09,016 --> 00:59:11,936
Well, I have some things to finish up here.

630
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:14,062
Good day, Mr. Wallace.

631
00:59:22,029 --> 00:59:24,032
That´s right. Select again.

632
00:59:24,032 --> 00:59:26,992
-´´Birds of a Feather´´ for $600.
-Answer..

633
00:59:27,034 --> 00:59:30,537
´´Vibrant in colour, its name borrows
from a Vivien Leigh character. ´´

634
00:59:30,537 --> 00:59:32,039
Scarlet tanager.

635
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:34,542
No, it´s ´´What is the scarlet tanager?´"

636
00:59:34,542 --> 00:59:36,042
What is the scarlet tanager?

637
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:38,546
See, you have to know the rules
to play the game.

638
00:59:38,546 --> 00:59:41,757
lt was written by a writer
you´ve never heard of.

639
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:45,094
´´Thy duty, winged flame of spring

640
00:59:46,554 --> 00:59:48,680
´´is but to love and fly

641
00:59:49,056 --> 00:59:52,642
´´and sing´´ He was writing about
the song of the tanager.

642
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:56,147
A song about new seasons, new life.

643
00:59:58,565 --> 01:00:00,567
That´s James Lowell, man.

644
01:00:00,567 --> 01:00:02,403
I know who he is.

645
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:06,365
l´ll stay with ´´Poor Assumptions´"
for $800, Alex.

646
01:00:08,075 --> 01:00:10,578
Ever seen any scarlet tanagers
around here?

647
01:00:10,578 --> 01:00:13,372
They don´t stray that far from the park.

648
01:00:19,086 --> 01:00:22,923
So, your professor wasn´t exactly
full of praise this afternoon?

649
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:25,218
Not exactly.

650
01:00:26,093 --> 01:00:29,597
There´s something you should know
about Robert Crawford.

651
01:00:31,598 --> 01:00:34,351
He wrote a book a few years after mine.

652
01:00:35,102 --> 01:00:38,813
All the publishers rejected it,
which was the right decision.

653
01:00:40,607 --> 01:00:43,110
lnstead of writing another one...

654
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:46,197
...he took a job
teaching others how to write.

655
01:00:48,615 --> 01:00:50,117
How do you know all that?

656
01:00:50,117 --> 01:00:53,454
Just remember that bitterly
disappointed teachers...

657
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,666
...can be either very effective...

658
01:00:57,625 --> 01:00:59,626
...or very dangerous.

659
01:01:46,673 --> 01:01:50,343
Okay, this is the first step tonight, guys.
Mailor on three.

660
01:01:51,678 --> 01:01:53,805
One, two, three, Mailor!

661
01:02:20,707 --> 01:02:22,334
Gold. Black.

662
01:02:25,211 --> 01:02:27,339
Straight and high, boys.

663
01:02:39,726 --> 01:02:40,727
What up, J?

664
01:02:40,727 --> 01:02:43,480
-You was in there tonight?
-26 points.

665
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:46,733
8 out of 10 from the floor,
10 from 10 from the line.

666
01:02:46,733 --> 01:02:47,734
l´m supposed to miss that?

667
01:02:47,734 --> 01:02:49,236
lt was hot.

668
01:02:49,236 --> 01:02:52,238
You were putting some serious ink
on that stat page.

669
01:02:52,238 --> 01:02:54,032
What´s going on?

670
01:02:55,242 --> 01:02:58,619
Brothers are going to Red Rose.
I said we´d catch up.

671
01:02:58,745 --> 01:03:00,747
Friday night. Come on.

672
01:03:00,747 --> 01:03:03,625
Jamal, you plan on doing that every night?

673
01:03:04,251 --> 01:03:06,837
-Worked out, I guess.
-l´d say so.

674
01:03:09,255 --> 01:03:10,757
This is Fly.

675
01:03:10,757 --> 01:03:13,551
Hi. l´m Claire. You a friend of Jamal´s?

676
01:03:13,759 --> 01:03:15,553
Claire! Come on.

677
01:03:15,762 --> 01:03:17,348
l´m coming.

678
01:03:17,765 --> 01:03:21,184
Don´t hold up the bus too long.
Nice meeting you, Fly.

679
01:03:22,269 --> 01:03:24,937
What the hell you working there, man?

680
01:03:26,272 --> 01:03:27,941
Shut up, man.

681
01:03:29,276 --> 01:03:31,318
Yo, about Red Rose....

682
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,783
I got to go to this dude´s house.
They do it every year.

683
01:03:37,283 --> 01:03:38,785
Don´t go off on this.

684
01:03:38,785 --> 01:03:42,205
You big time. Go on.
I don´t want to hold your bus up.

685
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:44,791
Will you be around this weekend?

686
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:47,626
Where do you think l´ll be? The Hamptons?

687
01:04:39,346 --> 01:04:42,848
Very nice talking with you.
Now, if you need anything...

688
01:04:42,848 --> 01:04:45,268
...please give me a call. Okay?

689
01:04:47,353 --> 01:04:48,687
Okay.

690
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,696
Building up a collection of those things?

691
01:04:57,864 --> 01:04:59,490
Yeah, a few.

692
01:04:59,865 --> 01:05:02,285
Want to go outside for a while?

693
01:05:02,368 --> 01:05:04,579
Yeah. You know this place?

694
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:07,749
I live in this place. Come on.

695
01:05:16,382 --> 01:05:20,219
They´ll be congratulating themselves
on your game till midnight.

696
01:05:20,887 --> 01:05:24,683
Which means l´lI have to cram tomorrow
for this test on Monday.

697
01:05:24,891 --> 01:05:26,393
Test on what?

698
01:05:26,393 --> 01:05:28,394
On the Sherlock Holmes books.

699
01:05:28,394 --> 01:05:31,397
They have us tracking down
all this worthless stuff like:

700
01:05:31,397 --> 01:05:33,857
Who introduced Watson to Holmes?

701
01:05:33,899 --> 01:05:37,570
They give it to you
´cause it forces you to read everything.

702
01:05:38,404 --> 01:05:40,824
Looks like it might be a while.

703
01:05:40,907 --> 01:05:42,409
Maybe so.

704
01:05:42,409 --> 01:05:45,912
So this friend, Fly,
how long have you known each other?

705
01:05:47,413 --> 01:05:50,416
A while. He was born there
and I was born there, too.

706
01:05:50,416 --> 01:05:52,334
-The Bronx?
-Yeah.

707
01:05:52,918 --> 01:05:54,421
Must be hard.

708
01:05:54,421 --> 01:05:55,755
What?

709
01:05:56,422 --> 01:05:58,508
New people, new school.

710
01:05:59,426 --> 01:06:00,926
lt´s not?

711
01:06:01,427 --> 01:06:02,678
No.

712
01:06:02,928 --> 01:06:07,349
What´s hard is growing up in a place
cops don´t even want to be in after dark.

713
01:06:08,434 --> 01:06:11,271
What´s hard is knowing you´re safe there.

714
01:06:11,438 --> 01:06:15,942
´Cause the people you need to worry about,
know you´ve got nothing to give them.

715
01:06:16,943 --> 01:06:19,445
So it´s a good thing you´re here.

716
01:06:21,447 --> 01:06:24,951
These people don´t think
I got anything to give them, either.

717
01:06:24,951 --> 01:06:28,413
Don´t let me get by you.
Once I get by you, l´ll score.

718
01:06:29,455 --> 01:06:32,333
Ready? Now stay in front of me, all right?

719
01:06:33,459 --> 01:06:35,002
All right?

720
01:06:37,963 --> 01:06:39,632
I got by you.

721
01:06:39,965 --> 01:06:42,093
You´re bigger than I am.

722
01:06:42,969 --> 01:06:44,971
lt doesn´t matter. You still got to defend.

723
01:06:44,971 --> 01:06:46,806
How do I do that?

724
01:06:47,473 --> 01:06:50,852
How do you play defence?
l´ll show you one way, here.

725
01:06:51,476 --> 01:06:53,103
Turn around.

726
01:06:57,483 --> 01:06:58,985
Feel that?

727
01:06:58,985 --> 01:07:00,486
I feel it.

728
01:07:00,486 --> 01:07:03,989
Now I know where you´ll go,
because I can feel you move.

729
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:06,868
Try and move left.

730
01:07:08,994 --> 01:07:12,374
See, you can´t get around me.
I feel you moving left.

731
01:07:12,999 --> 01:07:14,834
Try and go right.

732
01:07:17,503 --> 01:07:19,004
l´m still here.

733
01:07:19,004 --> 01:07:22,508
I feel when you try to go right,
so you can´t go there, neither.

734
01:07:22,508 --> 01:07:24,551
Now try and get by me.

735
01:07:26,011 --> 01:07:27,472
Hold on.

736
01:07:28,515 --> 01:07:30,516
You have to dribble first.

737
01:07:30,516 --> 01:07:32,602
Dribble. Okay. Like....

738
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,063
Like this?

739
01:07:39,024 --> 01:07:40,860
-Sorry.
-Claire.

740
01:07:42,027 --> 01:07:43,404
Daddy?

741
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:46,449
Some of our guests are leaving.

742
01:07:47,032 --> 01:07:49,368
l´lI see you on Monday, okay?

743
01:08:02,048 --> 01:08:03,466
Claire?

744
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:05,885
Yeah?

745
01:08:06,051 --> 01:08:07,845
lt was Stamford.

746
01:08:08,554 --> 01:08:10,055
Excuse me?

747
01:08:10,055 --> 01:08:11,556
At the bar in London.

748
01:08:11,556 --> 01:08:14,561
He was the one
who introduced Watson to Holmes.

749
01:08:14,561 --> 01:08:18,439
Might actually save you some time
after everyone´s done in there.

750
01:08:25,571 --> 01:08:28,073
You know how long
l´ve been working on that?

751
01:08:28,073 --> 01:08:32,828
lt ain´t one season of faith´s perfection.
Feels like I worked on it for two or three.

752
01:08:37,582 --> 01:08:40,836
You´re in that place
where you can´t even hear me.

753
01:08:41,086 --> 01:08:45,090
I could ask why you never left
this neighbourhood, and you wouldn´t--

754
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:47,260
Paragraph three starts...

755
01:08:48,094 --> 01:08:50,513
...with a conjunction, ´´and.´"

756
01:08:51,096 --> 01:08:54,099
You should never start a sentence
with a conjunction.

757
01:08:54,099 --> 01:08:56,059
-Sure you can.
-No.

758
01:08:56,101 --> 01:08:57,603
lt´s a firm rule.

759
01:08:57,603 --> 01:08:58,854
No.

760
01:08:59,104 --> 01:09:03,568
lt was a firm rule. Sometimes using
a conjunction at the start of a sentence...

761
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:08,113
...makes it stand out. And that may be
what the writer´s trying to do.

762
01:09:08,113 --> 01:09:10,116
And what is the risk?

763
01:09:10,615 --> 01:09:12,492
Doing it too much.

764
01:09:13,118 --> 01:09:16,621
lt´s a distraction
and could give your piece a run-on feeling.

765
01:09:16,621 --> 01:09:21,294
But the rule on using ´´and´´ or ´´but´´
at the start of a sentence is pretty shaky.

766
01:09:22,127 --> 01:09:25,130
Even though it´s still taught
by too many professors.

767
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:29,342
Some of the best writers have ignored
that rule for years, including you.

768
01:09:32,639 --> 01:09:35,724
Well, you´ve taken something
which was mine...

769
01:09:37,643 --> 01:09:40,729
...and made it yours.
Quite an accomplishment.

770
01:09:43,649 --> 01:09:45,150
Thank you.

771
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:47,652
The title´s still mine, isn´t it?

772
01:09:49,655 --> 01:09:51,115
I guess.

773
01:09:51,657 --> 01:09:54,744
lt was the neighbourhood that changed,
not me.

774
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,661
I ain´t seen nothin´ changed.

775
01:09:56,661 --> 01:10:00,748
You ´´ain´t seen nothin´´´?
What in the hell kind of sentence is that?

776
01:10:02,667 --> 01:10:05,546
In here, don´t talk like you do out there.

777
01:10:05,671 --> 01:10:08,632
I was messin´ with you, man.
lt was a joke.

778
01:10:12,677 --> 01:10:17,099
Tell me about the neighbourhood back
when people were still reading your book.

779
01:10:17,682 --> 01:10:19,518
What did you say?

780
01:10:22,688 --> 01:10:23,688
Nothing.

781
01:10:23,688 --> 01:10:27,234
You said ´´back when people
were still reading my book.´´

782
01:10:29,194 --> 01:10:30,779
Didn´t you?

783
01:10:38,204 --> 01:10:40,163
We have 24 copies...

784
01:10:40,205 --> 01:10:42,958
...but l´m sorry, they are checked out.

785
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:48,088
Thank you, anyway.

786
01:10:52,718 --> 01:10:54,219
Any luck?

787
01:10:56,222 --> 01:10:58,223
Did you get on the waiting list?

788
01:10:58,223 --> 01:11:00,434
Your book was checked out.

789
01:11:01,727 --> 01:11:03,227
And, yes...

790
01:11:03,227 --> 01:11:05,355
...I did pay for dinner.

791
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:08,483
lt cost me $13, so you made your point.

792
01:11:10,235 --> 01:11:13,738
I tried to call to see what food you wanted,
but the phone kept ringing.

793
01:11:13,738 --> 01:11:16,241
I took the bell out 20 years ago.

794
01:11:22,248 --> 01:11:23,749
Let me ask you something.

795
01:11:23,749 --> 01:11:25,959
Why does a guy like you...

796
01:11:28,253 --> 01:11:31,256
...waste his time reading
National Enquirer?

797
01:11:31,256 --> 01:11:33,258
What´s wrong with it?

798
01:11:34,259 --> 01:11:35,260
lt´s trash, man.

799
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:38,263
You should be reading
The Times or something.

800
01:11:38,263 --> 01:11:40,641
I read The Times for dinner...

801
01:11:42,267 --> 01:11:44,478
...but this is my dessert.

802
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:47,563
They got some writing contest at school.

803
01:11:47,772 --> 01:11:50,275
-You ever enter one of those?
-A writing contest?

804
01:11:50,275 --> 01:11:51,985
-Yeah.
-Once.

805
01:11:52,777 --> 01:11:55,239
-A long time ago.
-Did you win?

806
01:11:56,281 --> 01:11:58,324
Well, of course I won.

807
01:11:58,783 --> 01:12:00,911
Like money or something?

808
01:12:01,787 --> 01:12:03,455
The Pulitzer.

809
01:12:06,791 --> 01:12:09,794
They make all the students
read in front of everyone.

810
01:12:09,794 --> 01:12:12,297
What the hell´s that got to do with writing?

811
01:12:12,297 --> 01:12:16,176
Writers write so that readers can read.
Let someone else read it.

812
01:12:16,801 --> 01:12:18,803
You ever read your own book?

813
01:12:18,803 --> 01:12:20,763
In public? Hell, no.

814
01:12:21,305 --> 01:12:23,599
I barely read it in private.

815
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:28,021
You know those things they do,
that coffee shop reading shit?

816
01:12:28,814 --> 01:12:31,066
Do you know why they do it?

817
01:12:31,816 --> 01:12:33,318
To sell books, I guess.

818
01:12:33,318 --> 01:12:35,695
Because they want to get laid.

819
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:38,823
Really? Women will sleep with you
if you write a book?

820
01:12:38,823 --> 01:12:41,952
They´ll sleep with you
if you write a bad book.

821
01:12:43,328 --> 01:12:45,914
-Did it ever happen to you?
-Sure.

822
01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:51,002
Did you ever get married?

823
01:12:52,837 --> 01:12:55,423
Not exactly a soup question, is it?

824
01:12:56,341 --> 01:12:58,135
No, I never did.

825
01:13:01,346 --> 01:13:03,849
But I learned a few things along the way...

826
01:13:03,849 --> 01:13:07,643
...which might help with this young lady
you always talk about.

827
01:13:09,354 --> 01:13:10,896
Like what?

828
01:13:13,358 --> 01:13:15,694
The key to a woman´s heart...

829
01:13:15,861 --> 01:13:18,988
...is an unexpected gift
at an unexpected time.

830
01:13:20,365 --> 01:13:22,867
You´re giving me advice on women?

831
01:13:22,867 --> 01:13:25,370
Unexpected gift, unexpected time.

832
01:13:28,373 --> 01:13:30,417
This is so unexpected.

833
01:13:34,379 --> 01:13:37,090
lt´s not a first printing or anything.

834
01:13:37,882 --> 01:13:39,383
Oh, my gosh.

835
01:13:39,383 --> 01:13:41,802
-What?
-This is a signed copy.

836
01:13:42,888 --> 01:13:45,890
I can´t accept this.
lt must have cost a fortune.

837
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:48,393
lt didn´t cost that much, really.

838
01:13:48,894 --> 01:13:51,270
Maybe the bookstore missed it.

839
01:13:52,397 --> 01:13:55,232
Bookstores don´t usually miss this stuff.

840
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,904
How´d you end up going to Mailor?

841
01:13:59,905 --> 01:14:02,866
Mailor was originally an all-boys´ school...

842
01:14:02,907 --> 01:14:06,494
...so, my father did
what anyone in his position would do.

843
01:14:07,912 --> 01:14:10,415
He got on the board and changed the rules.

844
01:14:10,415 --> 01:14:12,750
And every kid there knows it.

845
01:14:13,417 --> 01:14:14,920
They´d have done it anyway.

846
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:18,673
That doesn´t change anything.
l´m still Dr. Spence´s daughter.

847
01:14:24,428 --> 01:14:27,223
That night at my home, after the game...

848
01:14:27,432 --> 01:14:30,727
...when you were showing me
how to play basketball:

849
01:14:32,938 --> 01:14:35,439
Was that all you were showing me?

850
01:14:37,442 --> 01:14:39,611
That´s not going to work.

851
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:41,278
What?

852
01:14:41,946 --> 01:14:43,281
That.

853
01:14:43,447 --> 01:14:44,908
Why not?

854
01:14:47,452 --> 01:14:49,245
Ask your father.

855
01:14:49,955 --> 01:14:53,332
l´m not asking for some kind
of prenuptial agreement.

856
01:14:54,959 --> 01:14:56,960
lt´s just a question.

857
01:14:57,461 --> 01:15:00,757
Why must everything be
so black and white with you?

858
01:15:03,968 --> 01:15:05,970
I forgot the question.

859
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:08,764
You don´t forget anything, Mr. Stamford.

860
01:15:23,488 --> 01:15:27,366
You don´t think he wrote it?
That´s a serious accusation, Robert.

861
01:15:27,992 --> 01:15:30,494
You come to the Faculty Board with this....

862
01:15:30,494 --> 01:15:32,914
l´m aware of how serious it is.

863
01:15:32,997 --> 01:15:35,000
lt´s remarkable work.

864
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,001
You recognize any of it?

865
01:15:37,001 --> 01:15:39,087
lt smacks of something.

866
01:15:40,004 --> 01:15:41,839
But I don´t know.

867
01:15:42,506 --> 01:15:46,177
The boy does well in my class.
He had good scores coming in.

868
01:15:47,512 --> 01:15:49,514
Maybe he just needed direction.

869
01:15:49,514 --> 01:15:52,600
Carl, he´s a basketball player
from the Bronx.

870
01:15:53,017 --> 01:15:55,728
Who happens to have won 17 straight...

871
01:15:56,521 --> 01:15:59,106
...for a school that likes winning.

872
01:16:00,524 --> 01:16:03,653
Have you considered
he might just be that good?

873
01:16:09,034 --> 01:16:10,743
Not this good.

874
01:17:00,584 --> 01:17:03,629
Do you know
what the absolute best moment is?

875
01:17:04,588 --> 01:17:07,383
When you´ve finished your first draft...

876
01:17:08,092 --> 01:17:10,512
...and you read it by yourself.

877
01:17:11,595 --> 01:17:13,764
Before these arseholes...

878
01:17:14,098 --> 01:17:17,392
...take something
they couldn´t do in a lifetime...

879
01:17:18,101 --> 01:17:20,729
...and tear it down in a single day.

880
01:17:22,606 --> 01:17:24,859
People love that book, man.

881
01:17:25,109 --> 01:17:27,361
I didn´t write it for them.

882
01:17:28,612 --> 01:17:32,074
And when the critics
started all this bullshit about...

883
01:17:33,116 --> 01:17:36,078
...what it was I was really trying to say...

884
01:17:37,622 --> 01:17:39,832
...well, I decided then...

885
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:43,211
...one book was enough.

886
01:17:44,628 --> 01:17:47,256
William, that was 50 years ago, man.

887
01:20:58,947 --> 01:21:02,159
I actually spent money on these tickets.
Come on.

888
01:21:02,451 --> 01:21:04,453
ls it still light outside?

889
01:21:04,453 --> 01:21:06,204
lt´s nighttime.

890
01:21:14,462 --> 01:21:15,798
Well?

891
01:21:16,965 --> 01:21:19,468
You look good. lt´s not the latest stuff--

892
01:21:19,468 --> 01:21:21,720
I wasn´t asking how I look.

893
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:25,432
-I was asking, are we ready to go?
-Yeah. Come on, man.

894
01:21:27,475 --> 01:21:28,976
Let´s go.

895
01:21:34,483 --> 01:21:35,942
Come on.

896
01:21:46,494 --> 01:21:48,706
We play here in two weeks.

897
01:21:49,998 --> 01:21:53,335
I said, we play here in two weeks.
State tournament.

898
01:22:12,019 --> 01:22:14,480
Hold on. Let me get a programme.

899
01:22:49,558 --> 01:22:50,893
Damn.

900
01:24:06,133 --> 01:24:08,345
Let´s get you out of here.

901
01:24:10,138 --> 01:24:11,681
I got you.

902
01:24:40,669 --> 01:24:42,920
You used to get out, right?

903
01:24:43,671 --> 01:24:45,673
Yeah, a long time ago.

904
01:24:45,673 --> 01:24:47,675
-What happened?
-How should I know?

905
01:24:47,675 --> 01:24:50,135
I didn´t keep track of the time.

906
01:24:50,177 --> 01:24:52,638
Sorry for losing you back there.

907
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:53,681
No apology needed.

908
01:24:53,681 --> 01:24:57,435
Good. l´ve got one more place.
lt´s quiet and on the way home.

909
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:05,400
You only got 10 minutes.

910
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,902
All right.

911
01:25:06,902 --> 01:25:08,445
Take that.

912
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,089
Ground level.

913
01:25:27,923 --> 01:25:30,301
´´The house that Ruth built.´"

914
01:25:36,432 --> 01:25:38,642
Why did you bring me here?

915
01:25:38,934 --> 01:25:41,186
Because it´s your birthday.

916
01:25:42,939 --> 01:25:45,316
I looked it up in the almanac.

917
01:25:45,942 --> 01:25:48,820
You´re not in the dead people section yet.

918
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:56,326
I figure with all the games you watched...

919
01:25:57,954 --> 01:26:00,749
...with whoever you watched them with...

920
01:26:00,956 --> 01:26:02,958
...you probably never got this close.

921
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:05,420
What are they doing on the dirt?

922
01:26:05,962 --> 01:26:10,007
Who cares? You acting like
they´re going to play a World Series game.

923
01:26:10,966 --> 01:26:12,342
Relax.

924
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:15,555
My brother and I,
we were here for every game.

925
01:26:18,974 --> 01:26:21,143
Till he left for the war.

926
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:26,815
I thought it´d be the same
when he came back, but...

927
01:26:27,983 --> 01:26:30,319
...he talked a little less...

928
01:26:30,987 --> 01:26:33,239
...and drank a little more.

929
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:37,535
I promised my mother
I would help him get through it all.

930
01:26:42,998 --> 01:26:45,626
I caught up with him this one night.

931
01:26:46,001 --> 01:26:48,838
I was already haIf a dozen drinks behind.

932
01:26:50,506 --> 01:26:52,591
So we had a few more...

933
01:26:53,008 --> 01:26:56,178
...and after a while,
he tells me he wants to...

934
01:26:57,012 --> 01:26:59,557
...drive me back to the apartment.

935
01:27:00,016 --> 01:27:02,060
I said ´´No, thanks.´"

936
01:27:04,019 --> 01:27:06,689
We were all still living there, then.

937
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:10,692
I just stood there and...

938
01:27:12,027 --> 01:27:14,195
...watched him drive off.

939
01:27:18,034 --> 01:27:21,036
He makes it through
the whole goddamn war...

940
01:27:22,037 --> 01:27:24,123
...and I let him drive.

941
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:30,378
Later that night, the nurse was typing...

942
01:27:31,547 --> 01:27:33,925
...whatever it is they type...

943
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:37,094
...and you know what she tells me?

944
01:27:38,554 --> 01:27:41,514
She tells me how much
my book meant to her.

945
01:27:43,058 --> 01:27:46,145
My brother is getting cold
in the next room...

946
01:27:47,563 --> 01:27:50,358
...and all she can talk about is a book.

947
01:27:59,074 --> 01:28:01,493
Within five months, I buried...

948
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:03,745
...him, my ma, my father.

949
01:28:05,581 --> 01:28:07,958
All of them here in the Bronx.

950
01:28:13,589 --> 01:28:15,882
We´d spend our summers here.

951
01:28:18,094 --> 01:28:20,512
And if we were lucky, the fall.

952
01:28:21,096 --> 01:28:23,557
A lot of falls with those teams.

953
01:28:23,599 --> 01:28:25,267
Yeah, well...

954
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,311
...not enough.

955
01:28:29,104 --> 01:28:32,190
´´The rest of those
who have gone before us...

956
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:35,444
´´...cannot steady the unrest of those...

957
01:28:36,112 --> 01:28:37,946
´´...to follow.´"

958
01:28:40,115 --> 01:28:42,409
You wrote that in your book.

959
01:29:09,645 --> 01:29:13,357
I realise that if I give you enough time
you´ll find a way...

960
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:16,609
...to amaze even me.

961
01:29:19,154 --> 01:29:20,823
Does he know?

962
01:29:21,657 --> 01:29:23,617
No, he doesn´t know.

963
01:29:23,659 --> 01:29:27,412
This was one of the best evenings l´ve had
in quite some time.

964
01:29:29,164 --> 01:29:30,707
All of it?

965
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:32,459
Yes.

966
01:29:32,668 --> 01:29:34,168
All of it.

967
01:29:34,168 --> 01:29:35,753
Well, I....

968
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:46,306
This guy....

969
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:50,434
How do you say you know this guy again?

970
01:29:50,685 --> 01:29:52,855
-He´s my teacher.
-Yeah?

971
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:57,359
Seemed like a different kind of dude.

972
01:30:04,199 --> 01:30:06,201
Anyone in particular?

973
01:30:07,703 --> 01:30:10,372
I sometimes come here in the morning.

974
01:30:11,207 --> 01:30:13,333
Just me, the aspiring...

975
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:16,628
...and all of them.

976
01:30:20,215 --> 01:30:23,885
There was a note downstairs
saying I should come to see you.

977
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:26,930
Mr. Wallace...

978
01:30:27,222 --> 01:30:31,893
...I think it´s time you and I had an honest
and open discussion about your writing.

979
01:30:34,729 --> 01:30:36,731
I thought you liked it.

980
01:30:36,731 --> 01:30:38,567
Your recent work?

981
01:30:39,235 --> 01:30:41,236
I liked it very much.

982
01:30:41,736 --> 01:30:45,074
No, the question concerning
your most recent work...

983
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:49,077
...isn´t whether it´s good...

984
01:30:50,245 --> 01:30:52,622
...it´s whether it´s too good.

985
01:30:54,249 --> 01:30:58,753
The acceleration in your progress from
your old school to this one is unusual...

986
01:30:59,755 --> 01:31:03,257
...to the point that I must draw
one of two conclusions:

987
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,932
Either you´ve been blessed with
an uncommon gift, which has kicked in...

988
01:31:11,266 --> 01:31:12,726
...or...

989
01:31:14,269 --> 01:31:17,522
...you´re getting your inspiration
from elsewhere.

990
01:31:18,774 --> 01:31:22,110
Given your previous education
and your background...

991
01:31:22,277 --> 01:31:26,072
...l´m sure you´ll forgive me
for coming to my own conclusions.

992
01:31:26,281 --> 01:31:28,283
I wrote those papers.

993
01:31:28,283 --> 01:31:30,702
Then you won´t mind showing me.

994
01:31:31,786 --> 01:31:34,289
The next assignment´s due in two weeks.

995
01:31:34,289 --> 01:31:37,667
l´ll schedule some time for you
to come to my office.

996
01:31:39,293 --> 01:31:41,921
l´d like to have you write it there.

997
01:31:44,299 --> 01:31:48,094
In the meantime, if there´s anything
you wish to talk about....

998
01:31:50,305 --> 01:31:52,474
l´m not writing anything.

999
01:31:53,307 --> 01:31:54,809
Which proves what?

1000
01:31:54,809 --> 01:31:59,314
If a two-comma kid wrote these papers,
he´d say, ´´Considering your background´´?

1001
01:31:59,314 --> 01:32:01,316
-Two-comma kid?
-$1,000,000.

1002
01:32:01,316 --> 01:32:03,360
One comma, two commas.

1003
01:32:03,818 --> 01:32:05,445
No, I don´t.

1004
01:32:06,321 --> 01:32:09,282
Do you know what
people are most afraid of?

1005
01:32:09,823 --> 01:32:12,327
-What?
-What they don´t understand.

1006
01:32:12,327 --> 01:32:15,705
When we don´t understand,
we turn to our assumptions.

1007
01:32:17,832 --> 01:32:19,835
Crawford cannot understand...

1008
01:32:19,835 --> 01:32:23,337
...how a black kid from the Bronx
can write the way you do.

1009
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:25,465
So he assumes you can´t.

1010
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:29,928
Just like I assume he´s an asshole.

1011
01:32:30,846 --> 01:32:32,346
You knew him, didn´t you?

1012
01:32:32,346 --> 01:32:34,015
Crawford? No.

1013
01:32:36,351 --> 01:32:38,352
But he thought he knew me.

1014
01:32:38,352 --> 01:32:40,813
So what was that about his book?

1015
01:32:40,855 --> 01:32:44,025
A lot of writers
know the rules about writing...

1016
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:46,361
...but they don´t know how to write.

1017
01:32:46,361 --> 01:32:47,362
So?

1018
01:32:47,362 --> 01:32:50,907
So Crawford wrote a book
about four authors who did know.

1019
01:32:51,866 --> 01:32:54,285
I was the only one still alive.

1020
01:32:55,369 --> 01:32:57,955
He convinced a publisher to buy it.

1021
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:02,377
I made a polite telephone call...

1022
01:33:02,877 --> 01:33:05,963
...to this publisher, telling him and others...

1023
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:09,884
...I was in the process
of writing a second book...

1024
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:14,347
-...and if they wanted to bid on it--
-So that´s why Crawford´s book went away.

1025
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:18,893
But you knew
there wouldn´t be a second book.

1026
01:33:18,893 --> 01:33:20,937
Yeah, but they didn´t.

1027
01:33:27,402 --> 01:33:31,281
lnteresting what happens
when the resources aren´t close at hand.

1028
01:34:11,112 --> 01:34:15,491
The tradition of handing in composition
entries on the final day continues...

1029
01:34:17,452 --> 01:34:19,120
...for yet...

1030
01:34:19,454 --> 01:34:21,247
...another year.

1031
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:28,546
Ladies and gentlemen...

1032
01:34:28,962 --> 01:34:31,298
...may I have your attention?

1033
01:34:31,465 --> 01:34:33,677
Please, if you don´t mind.

1034
01:34:35,469 --> 01:34:37,972
´´Ere sin could blight or sorrow fade

1035
01:34:37,972 --> 01:34:40,391
´´Death came with friendly care

1036
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:43,185
´´The opening bud to heaven convey´d´"

1037
01:34:43,477 --> 01:34:45,729
How nice of you to join us.

1038
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,775
That´s not part of the poem.

1039
01:34:49,484 --> 01:34:52,153
´´And bade it blossom there´´ Anyone?

1040
01:34:55,490 --> 01:34:58,701
A little more early morning reticence
than usual.

1041
01:34:59,493 --> 01:35:01,203
Mr. Coleridge.

1042
01:35:03,997 --> 01:35:05,416
Please.

1043
01:35:08,002 --> 01:35:11,130
How many students
would you say are here today?

1044
01:35:13,507 --> 01:35:15,175
l´m not sure.

1045
01:35:15,509 --> 01:35:18,345
Perhaps you could humour us with a guess.

1046
01:35:20,515 --> 01:35:21,933
Thirty?

1047
01:35:22,016 --> 01:35:25,853
And of that 30, not one person knows
the author of that passage.

1048
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,065
I find that remarkable, don´t you?

1049
01:35:32,025 --> 01:35:34,528
Perhaps we should back into this.

1050
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:39,659
In looking at this, what, if any conclusions,
might we be able to draw?

1051
01:35:41,535 --> 01:35:43,746
You mean about the author?

1052
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:45,790
About anything.

1053
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:50,419
Do any of the words strike you as unusual?

1054
01:35:54,548 --> 01:35:58,302
Feel free to view this
as the appropriate time for a response.

1055
01:36:01,055 --> 01:36:02,515
´´Ere.´"

1056
01:36:02,556 --> 01:36:04,683
And why is that unusual?

1057
01:36:06,561 --> 01:36:08,605
Because it sounds old.

1058
01:36:10,564 --> 01:36:12,942
lt does sound old, doesn´t it?

1059
01:36:13,067 --> 01:36:15,444
Do you know why it sounds old?

1060
01:36:18,072 --> 01:36:20,074
Because it is old. More than 200 years old.

1061
01:36:20,074 --> 01:36:23,911
Written before your father was born,
before his father was born.

1062
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:26,079
But...

1063
01:36:26,079 --> 01:36:28,582
...that still does not excuse the fact
that you...

1064
01:36:28,582 --> 01:36:31,419
...don´t know who wrote it, now, does it?

1065
01:36:34,087 --> 01:36:36,340
l´m sorry, sir, I don´t....

1066
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:40,261
You, of all people here,
should know who wrote that passage.

1067
01:36:41,095 --> 01:36:43,680
And do you know why, Mr. Coleridge?

1068
01:36:44,097 --> 01:36:46,308
I repeat, do you know why?

1069
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:49,227
Just say your name, man.

1070
01:36:50,604 --> 01:36:53,775
Excuse me.
Did you have something to contribute?

1071
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:59,113
I just said that he should say his name.

1072
01:36:59,113 --> 01:37:02,866
And why would it be helpful
for Mr. Coleridge to say his name?

1073
01:37:03,617 --> 01:37:05,910
Because that´s who wrote it.

1074
01:37:06,119 --> 01:37:08,205
Very good, Mr. Wallace.

1075
01:37:10,124 --> 01:37:13,794
Perhaps your skills do extend
a bit farther than basketball.

1076
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:19,716
If we can turn to page--
You may be seated, Mr. Coleridge.

1077
01:37:20,634 --> 01:37:23,762
Turn to page 120
in the little blue book that--

1078
01:37:24,638 --> 01:37:26,099
Further.

1079
01:37:27,641 --> 01:37:29,184
l´m sorry?

1080
01:37:29,643 --> 01:37:31,020
Don´t.

1081
01:37:33,146 --> 01:37:36,984
You said my skills extend ´´farther´"
than the basketball court.

1082
01:37:37,150 --> 01:37:39,611
´´Farther´´ relates to distance.

1083
01:37:39,652 --> 01:37:42,365
´´Further´´ is a definition of degree.

1084
01:37:42,657 --> 01:37:44,658
You should have said ´´further.´"

1085
01:37:44,658 --> 01:37:46,744
Are you challenging me?

1086
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:50,163
No more than you challenged Coleridge.

1087
01:37:50,163 --> 01:37:53,750
Perhaps the challenge
should have been directed elsewhere.

1088
01:37:55,668 --> 01:37:58,172
´´It is a melancholy truth that even--

1089
01:37:58,172 --> 01:38:00,675
´´Great men have poor relations´"

1090
01:38:00,675 --> 01:38:02,134
Dickens.

1091
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:07,096
-´´You will hear the beat of--´"
-Kipling.

1092
01:38:08,181 --> 01:38:10,851
-´´All great truths begin--´"
-Shaw.

1093
01:38:11,184 --> 01:38:14,146
-´´Man is the only animal--
-´´That blushes

1094
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:16,941
´´or needs to´"

1095
01:38:19,693 --> 01:38:21,278
Mark Twain.

1096
01:38:21,695 --> 01:38:24,155
-Come on, Professor--
-Get out!

1097
01:38:25,698 --> 01:38:27,075
Get...

1098
01:38:27,201 --> 01:38:28,619
...out.

1099
01:38:35,709 --> 01:38:37,627
Yeah. l´ll get out.

1100
01:38:50,724 --> 01:38:53,226
-Leave it alone, Claire.
-Hold on, please.

1101
01:38:53,226 --> 01:38:56,229
So around here,
they kick you out if you know something?

1102
01:38:56,229 --> 01:38:58,231
You have no idea what Crawford could do.

1103
01:38:58,231 --> 01:39:00,359
You´re right about that.

1104
01:39:04,738 --> 01:39:07,574
-Do you think you should apologise?
-No.

1105
01:39:08,741 --> 01:39:10,452
-Do you?
-No.

1106
01:39:11,244 --> 01:39:14,790
You did nothing wrong.
You just beat him at his own game.

1107
01:39:15,249 --> 01:39:16,625
But...

1108
01:39:17,251 --> 01:39:20,086
...it would be a good time to be careful.

1109
01:39:20,253 --> 01:39:22,172
Careful about what?

1110
01:39:23,757 --> 01:39:27,844
You have a gift that should allow you
to do remarkable things in life.

1111
01:39:28,762 --> 01:39:30,764
That is, if you don´t screw it up...

1112
01:39:30,764 --> 01:39:33,392
...by being a 16-year-old right now.

1113
01:39:44,777 --> 01:39:47,197
You got a call from the office.

1114
01:39:54,287 --> 01:39:56,248
Mr. Wallace, please.

1115
01:39:58,791 --> 01:40:00,293
As you know...

1116
01:40:00,293 --> 01:40:05,006
...Professor Matthews is on Faculty Board.
Dr. Spence is chair of the Trustees Board.

1117
01:40:05,298 --> 01:40:08,844
We´ve been reviewing the writing
competition submissions.

1118
01:40:09,802 --> 01:40:13,974
We were hoping you might clarify
some points concerning your submission.

1119
01:40:14,808 --> 01:40:17,186
A Season of Faith´s Pefection.

1120
01:40:19,313 --> 01:40:21,272
Your piece, correct?

1121
01:40:22,315 --> 01:40:24,109
Yeah, that´s it.

1122
01:40:24,317 --> 01:40:28,947
It is standard policy to ask students
if they wish to credit any source material...

1123
01:40:30,323 --> 01:40:34,244
...or acknowledge any other writers
when turning in an assignment.

1124
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:38,915
Do you wish to do that?

1125
01:40:43,336 --> 01:40:44,670
1960.

1126
01:40:46,839 --> 01:40:49,593
An essay titled Baseball´s Best Year...

1127
01:40:51,845 --> 01:40:54,222
...with a subtitle that reads:

1128
01:40:54,347 --> 01:40:56,724
A Season of Faith´s Pefection.

1129
01:40:57,851 --> 01:41:00,895
Published in the New Yorker
and written by...

1130
01:41:01,354 --> 01:41:03,356
...William Forrester.

1131
01:41:07,861 --> 01:41:09,863
Your version is quite original, but...

1132
01:41:09,863 --> 01:41:13,283
...there is the title
and first paragraph to consider.

1133
01:41:14,868 --> 01:41:16,493
lsn´t there?

1134
01:41:19,373 --> 01:41:23,001
Either you happen to have
William Forrester´s permission...

1135
01:41:23,376 --> 01:41:24,878
...or....

1136
01:41:25,378 --> 01:41:27,838
Have you some other explanation?

1137
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:29,131
No.

1138
01:41:31,384 --> 01:41:33,177
That´s my paper.

1139
01:41:33,886 --> 01:41:38,392
Then your entry is now withdrawn and
this is a matter for the board to consider.

1140
01:41:38,891 --> 01:41:43,021
The board does have the authority
to place you on academic probation...

1141
01:41:44,396 --> 01:41:48,276
...which would prevent you
from playing basketball in the future.

1142
01:41:54,408 --> 01:41:56,909
Since the board doesn´t meet
till next week...

1143
01:41:56,909 --> 01:41:59,412
...you can play in this weekend´s
state championship.

1144
01:41:59,412 --> 01:42:02,832
But the board has a history
of taking these matters...

1145
01:42:04,417 --> 01:42:06,337
...quite seriously.

1146
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:10,090
So we would like to suggest
what we feel is a...

1147
01:42:10,423 --> 01:42:13,384
...solution that may satisfy these concerns.

1148
01:42:14,927 --> 01:42:16,346
Robert.

1149
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:20,975
What matters most is to ensure
this type of violation isn´t repeated.

1150
01:42:21,434 --> 01:42:22,770
So...

1151
01:42:22,936 --> 01:42:27,607
...you will be required to write an apology
to the students you took advantage of...

1152
01:42:27,941 --> 01:42:30,318
...by submitting this piece...

1153
01:42:30,943 --> 01:42:33,446
...and you will read it in front of my class.

1154
01:42:33,446 --> 01:42:34,947
l´m not reading anything.

1155
01:42:34,947 --> 01:42:39,328
The board will consider that when deciding
whether to renew your scholarship.

1156
01:42:39,953 --> 01:42:42,830
You haven´t left us with too many options.

1157
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:45,000
Excuse me.

1158
01:42:59,973 --> 01:43:03,017
Don´t ever embarrass me
in front of my class.

1159
01:43:07,979 --> 01:43:10,608
Return the pen when you´re finished.

1160
01:43:18,491 --> 01:43:20,951
No conventional greetings today?

1161
01:43:21,493 --> 01:43:24,498
Why have me rewrite something
you published?

1162
01:43:24,498 --> 01:43:25,498
Be careful.

1163
01:43:25,498 --> 01:43:28,001
Why didn´t you tell me
some magazine ran it?

1164
01:43:28,001 --> 01:43:30,003
Why the hell should it matter?

1165
01:43:30,003 --> 01:43:32,129
You should have told me.

1166
01:43:34,006 --> 01:43:35,508
What did you do with it?

1167
01:43:35,508 --> 01:43:37,259
I turned it in.

1168
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:41,056
I turned it in.
I had to show them something.

1169
01:43:41,514 --> 01:43:45,226
You promised me anything we wrote
in here would stay in here.

1170
01:43:46,019 --> 01:43:47,436
I know!

1171
01:43:51,023 --> 01:43:53,316
-I just thought--
-Shut up.

1172
01:43:59,031 --> 01:44:01,242
What are they telling you?

1173
01:44:03,036 --> 01:44:06,539
I go on probation unless I write a letter
saying I was wrong.

1174
01:44:06,539 --> 01:44:08,541
Then write the letter.

1175
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:10,542
l´m not writing anything.

1176
01:44:10,542 --> 01:44:13,463
You got him, he gets you. Write the letter.

1177
01:44:15,047 --> 01:44:17,258
And you´d let him do that?

1178
01:44:19,051 --> 01:44:21,762
ls this supposed to be another lesson?

1179
01:44:22,054 --> 01:44:25,516
l´m tired of all these lessons.
Every time I come here.

1180
01:44:28,061 --> 01:44:32,064
The title of your essay is at the top
of my paper. What´s the lesson in that?

1181
01:44:32,064 --> 01:44:33,566
l´m not the one who turned it in.

1182
01:44:33,566 --> 01:44:36,569
You talked all that trash
when all you had to say was:

1183
01:44:36,569 --> 01:44:40,364
´´Keep this one here
´cause it got printed in the New Yorker.´"

1184
01:44:41,073 --> 01:44:43,284
That´s all you had to say.

1185
01:44:45,077 --> 01:44:46,579
I could use a little help.

1186
01:44:46,579 --> 01:44:48,747
No, that´s not an option.

1187
01:44:49,581 --> 01:44:53,210
-You don´t even have to go--
-I said, that´s not an option.

1188
01:44:53,586 --> 01:44:55,170
Sorry, man.

1189
01:44:55,587 --> 01:44:57,589
l´m used to people not helping me.

1190
01:44:57,589 --> 01:45:00,718
Oh, Christ.
Not that self-pity father bullshit.

1191
01:45:02,595 --> 01:45:04,430
What did you say?

1192
01:45:09,602 --> 01:45:11,686
Man, fuck you, William!

1193
01:45:12,103 --> 01:45:15,108
The real bullshit
is you letting me take it on this one...

1194
01:45:15,108 --> 01:45:19,570
...´cause you´re scared to walk out the door
and do something for someone else.

1195
01:45:22,114 --> 01:45:24,408
That´s the only damn reason.

1196
01:45:25,618 --> 01:45:28,119
You don´t know a damn thing
about reasons.

1197
01:45:28,119 --> 01:45:30,123
There are no reasons!

1198
01:45:30,123 --> 01:45:33,333
Reasons why some of us live
and some of us don´t.

1199
01:45:33,625 --> 01:45:36,629
Fortunately for you,
you´ve decades to figure that out.

1200
01:45:36,629 --> 01:45:41,049
What´s the reason for having a locked
cabinet of writing no one can ever read?

1201
01:45:43,135 --> 01:45:45,012
What is that, man?

1202
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:49,767
l´m done with this shit.

1203
01:45:58,650 --> 01:46:01,362
Look, Jamal is here to pay us a visit.

1204
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:07,701
What´s up?

1205
01:46:09,161 --> 01:46:10,663
What´s up, y´all?

1206
01:46:10,663 --> 01:46:12,123
Come on.

1207
01:46:40,191 --> 01:46:43,195
How does your first game
in the Garden feel?

1208
01:46:44,696 --> 01:46:47,115
A little closer than I thought.

1209
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:51,370
That´s why I thought
it might be a good time for us to talk.

1210
01:46:51,703 --> 01:46:56,375
I know it´s been hard handling classes with
the time you have to spend on the court.

1211
01:46:56,709 --> 01:46:59,544
I couldn´t handle it, not at this school.

1212
01:47:00,212 --> 01:47:03,298
Maybe it was unfair of us
to ask you to do it.

1213
01:47:04,216 --> 01:47:07,386
I talked to the board members
and to Crawford...

1214
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:09,721
...and...

1215
01:47:10,222 --> 01:47:13,600
...we don´t want to pursue this
any more than you do.

1216
01:47:13,725 --> 01:47:17,771
So, l´m here to present you with an offer.
We forget the whole thing.

1217
01:47:18,731 --> 01:47:22,234
Next year, your academic schedule
will be less demanding.

1218
01:47:22,234 --> 01:47:23,736
Crawford wanted that?

1219
01:47:23,736 --> 01:47:26,405
Crawford wants what´s best for you...

1220
01:47:27,239 --> 01:47:28,740
...and for the school.

1221
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:30,742
What am I supposed to do?

1222
01:47:30,742 --> 01:47:34,247
You hold up a championship trophy
at the end of this tournament.

1223
01:47:34,247 --> 01:47:37,416
You make that happen,
l´ll make the rest happen.

1224
01:47:38,751 --> 01:47:40,252
All right?

1225
01:47:40,252 --> 01:47:42,963
Now, go finish up what you came to do.

1226
01:47:49,761 --> 01:47:51,681
Let´s go, Pilgrims!

1227
01:47:53,265 --> 01:47:55,434
Let´s go! Throw to Jamal!

1228
01:48:24,296 --> 01:48:26,214
Damn, man. Come on.

1229
01:48:27,299 --> 01:48:28,759
Defence!

1230
01:48:41,814 --> 01:48:43,773
Jamal, get the ball!

1231
01:49:01,833 --> 01:49:03,585
Good pass, man.

1232
01:49:11,843 --> 01:49:13,428
Pick it up.

1233
01:49:24,356 --> 01:49:26,525
Offensive foul! That way!

1234
01:49:26,859 --> 01:49:29,235
10, Gold. Offensive! That way.

1235
01:49:30,362 --> 01:49:32,614
You got them now. Let´s go.

1236
01:49:45,376 --> 01:49:46,878
Time-out.

1237
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:52,592
This is still our game. We stop here,
they´lI have to put us on the line.

1238
01:49:53,384 --> 01:49:57,055
When that happens, it´s all over.
Don´t lose your composure.

1239
01:49:57,889 --> 01:50:02,310
If they score, we don´t call a time-out.
The ball goes to Hartwell or Wallace.

1240
01:50:03,394 --> 01:50:06,022
Okay? Hartwell or Wallace. Let´s go.

1241
01:50:07,898 --> 01:50:09,150
Go!

1242
01:50:23,414 --> 01:50:25,249
What´s the score?

1243
01:50:25,416 --> 01:50:27,628
lt ain´t looking good, Ma.

1244
01:50:39,431 --> 01:50:41,640
Foul. 22, Blue. Two shots.

1245
01:50:45,437 --> 01:50:48,606
Foul, Blue team, 22.
Hit, two. Go line up, guys.

1246
01:50:57,449 --> 01:50:58,992
Two shots.

1247
01:51:02,454 --> 01:51:04,455
We´re going to make these.

1248
01:51:04,455 --> 01:51:07,459
-I can´t look.
-lt´s gonna be all right, Ma.

1249
01:51:17,969 --> 01:51:19,345
Do it.

1250
01:51:27,478 --> 01:51:28,814
Damn.

1251
01:51:34,986 --> 01:51:36,487
One shot.

1252
01:52:04,015 --> 01:52:05,641
That´s game.

1253
01:54:56,563 --> 01:54:59,648
Thank God.
He must have come in after we left.

1254
01:55:00,566 --> 01:55:02,068
Let him sleep.

1255
01:55:02,068 --> 01:55:05,362
-l´ll turn the light off.
-Turn it off and come on.

1256
01:55:12,078 --> 01:55:14,913
You started cleaning up your room, Jamal.

1257
01:55:30,096 --> 01:55:33,182
He looks very happy with himself,
that coyote.

1258
01:55:51,617 --> 01:55:53,952
Jamal, he wrote that for you.

1259
01:55:55,621 --> 01:55:56,956
When?

1260
01:55:57,123 --> 01:55:58,874
After the game.

1261
01:55:59,124 --> 01:56:02,044
He´s going back to the school this morning.

1262
01:56:03,129 --> 01:56:04,629
lt´s funny, though.

1263
01:56:04,629 --> 01:56:07,299
They always let you get but so far...

1264
01:56:07,633 --> 01:56:10,511
...before taking everything away from you.

1265
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:15,265
God, he´s such a good kid, man.
Then he gets to come back to this shit.

1266
01:56:57,183 --> 01:56:59,060
ls that seat open?

1267
01:57:01,186 --> 01:57:02,771
I think so.

1268
01:57:04,189 --> 01:57:06,983
This isn´t where I thought l´d find you.

1269
01:57:09,194 --> 01:57:11,195
lt´s still my school.

1270
01:57:12,196 --> 01:57:15,493
They want me out,
they´lI have to do it themselves.

1271
01:57:15,701 --> 01:57:17,244
They will.

1272
01:57:18,203 --> 01:57:19,705
Whatever.

1273
01:57:32,718 --> 01:57:37,139
´´The winter´s darkness and cold is but
a momentary prelude to the new spring.

1274
01:57:37,723 --> 01:57:41,768
´´And while its grip seems endless
our own perseverance proves equal.

1275
01:57:42,727 --> 01:57:44,230
´´We renew ourselves once again...

1276
01:57:44,230 --> 01:57:47,649
´´...seeking out the bright moments
that will serve...

1277
01:57:48,233 --> 01:57:50,777
´´...that will serve therefore....

1278
01:57:52,737 --> 01:57:56,073
´´Therefore serve
as the foundation of our future.´"

1279
01:57:57,742 --> 01:57:59,285
Thank you.

1280
01:58:09,254 --> 01:58:11,173
Professor Crawford.

1281
01:58:14,258 --> 01:58:16,345
May I read a few words?

1282
01:58:21,767 --> 01:58:23,810
What is he doing here?

1283
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:27,606
Yes, of course, by all means.

1284
01:58:30,776 --> 01:58:32,778
Thank you, Professor.

1285
01:58:46,792 --> 01:58:49,128
My name is William Forrester.

1286
01:58:55,801 --> 01:58:57,343
Excuse me.

1287
01:59:02,807 --> 01:59:04,476
l´m that one.

1288
01:59:08,813 --> 01:59:10,523
Losing Family.

1289
01:59:12,317 --> 01:59:15,403
´´Losing family obliges us
to find our family.

1290
01:59:18,324 --> 01:59:21,284
´´Not always the family that is our blood...

1291
01:59:21,326 --> 01:59:24,413
´´...but the family
that can become our blood.

1292
01:59:25,329 --> 01:59:29,250
´´Should we have the wisdom
to open our door to this new family...

1293
01:59:30,335 --> 01:59:34,757
´´...we will find that the wishes we had
for the father, who once guided us...

1294
01:59:36,341 --> 01:59:39,386
´´...for the brother, who once inspired us....

1295
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:18,549
´´The only thing left to say will be:

1296
02:00:18,883 --> 02:00:22,971
´´´I wish I had seen this,
or I wish I had done that, or I wish....´´"

1297
02:00:26,390 --> 02:00:28,685
Most of you are too young...

1298
02:00:29,894 --> 02:00:32,521
...to know what your wishes will be.

1299
02:00:32,897 --> 02:00:35,274
But when I read these words...

1300
02:00:36,402 --> 02:00:38,653
...words of hope, dreams...

1301
02:00:40,905 --> 02:00:43,199
...I realise that the one...

1302
02:00:43,407 --> 02:00:46,661
...wish that was granted to me,
so late in life...

1303
02:00:47,912 --> 02:00:50,289
...was the gift of friendship.

1304
02:00:53,919 --> 02:00:58,632
Mr. Forrester, l´m sure I speak on behalf
of everyone in thanking you for this visit.

1305
02:01:00,925 --> 02:01:02,426
The quality...

1306
02:01:02,426 --> 02:01:04,345
...of your words...

1307
02:01:04,929 --> 02:01:08,016
...is something we should
all aspire to reach.

1308
02:01:14,439 --> 02:01:17,233
May I ask to what do we owe this honour?

1309
02:01:18,943 --> 02:01:20,945
Professor Crawford...

1310
02:01:21,946 --> 02:01:25,825
...I spoke here today
because a friend of mine wasn´t allowed to.

1311
02:01:27,452 --> 02:01:30,580
A friend who had
the integrity to protect me...

1312
02:01:31,456 --> 02:01:34,208
...when I was unwilling to protect him.

1313
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:38,170
His name is Jamal Wallace.

1314
02:01:43,969 --> 02:01:46,470
Jamal Wallace is a friend of yours?

1315
02:01:46,470 --> 02:01:48,055
Yes, he is.

1316
02:01:50,474 --> 02:01:54,229
I helped him find his own words
by starting with some of mine.

1317
02:01:55,480 --> 02:01:57,649
In return, he promised...

1318
02:01:58,983 --> 02:02:01,527
...never to say anything about me.

1319
02:02:03,988 --> 02:02:06,115
A promise which he kept.

1320
02:02:08,492 --> 02:02:12,371
While your visit seems heartfelt,
l´m sure you will appreciate...

1321
02:02:12,997 --> 02:02:15,667
...it will not change or interfere...

1322
02:02:16,501 --> 02:02:20,755
...with this institution reaching a fair
and proper decision in this case.

1323
02:02:21,005 --> 02:02:23,299
There´s one more issue here.

1324
02:02:25,510 --> 02:02:27,971
Those words that I read today...

1325
02:02:30,014 --> 02:02:32,016
...I didn´t write them.

1326
02:02:32,016 --> 02:02:33,893
Jamal Wallace did.

1327
02:02:44,028 --> 02:02:45,405
Quiet.

1328
02:02:48,532 --> 02:02:50,243
Quiet, please.

1329
02:02:51,035 --> 02:02:52,536
Be still.

1330
02:02:55,039 --> 02:02:56,750
Quiet, please.

1331
02:02:57,541 --> 02:02:59,585
That has no bearing...

1332
02:03:00,044 --> 02:03:02,547
...on the decision concerning Mr.--

1333
02:03:02,547 --> 02:03:06,050
As director of this competition,
I have final say in this matter.

1334
02:03:06,050 --> 02:03:07,885
Robert, sit down.

1335
02:03:08,052 --> 02:03:11,096
I have been a teacher
for more than 30 years.

1336
02:03:11,555 --> 02:03:15,351
That´s long enough to know
that integrity counts for something.

1337
02:03:15,559 --> 02:03:18,521
l´d say that Mr. Forrester has cleared up...

1338
02:03:19,063 --> 02:03:20,564
...this matter...

1339
02:03:20,564 --> 02:03:24,652
...very nicely for us all.
As chairman of the Faculty Board, I have...

1340
02:03:25,068 --> 02:03:27,529
...the last word in that matter.

1341
02:03:28,072 --> 02:03:31,075
You are excused
from next week´s board meeting.

1342
02:03:31,075 --> 02:03:32,868
Mr. Forrester...

1343
02:03:34,078 --> 02:03:37,706
...should you ever be interested
in a teaching position....

1344
02:03:38,082 --> 02:03:39,333
No.

1345
02:03:41,585 --> 02:03:43,880
Jamal, these are your words?

1346
02:03:47,092 --> 02:03:48,551
Sixteen.

1347
02:03:50,094 --> 02:03:51,679
Remarkable.

1348
02:04:19,123 --> 02:04:22,668
l´m thinking you´ll make
your own decisions from here on.

1349
02:04:24,128 --> 02:04:27,589
I thought you´d say something like,
´´l always could.´´

1350
02:04:28,131 --> 02:04:31,094
No more lessons.
I have a question, though.

1351
02:04:32,636 --> 02:04:35,723
Those two foul shots
at the end of the game...

1352
02:04:36,641 --> 02:04:39,518
...did you miss them or did you miss them?

1353
02:04:41,145 --> 02:04:43,730
Not exactly a soup question, is it?

1354
02:04:45,649 --> 02:04:47,151
Let´s go.

1355
02:04:49,653 --> 02:04:53,783
Do you think our vaudeville act today
will merit the National Enquirer?

1356
02:04:54,158 --> 02:04:55,742
Definitely.

1357
02:04:57,661 --> 02:04:59,871
Whatever happens, l´m off.

1358
02:05:02,166 --> 02:05:05,669
What´s the word
you and your friends would use for that?

1359
02:05:06,169 --> 02:05:07,629
Leaving?

1360
02:05:08,172 --> 02:05:09,632
Oh, God.

1361
02:05:10,174 --> 02:05:11,675
Where are you off to?

1362
02:05:11,675 --> 02:05:14,761
I have a homeland
I haven´t seen for too long.

1363
02:05:15,179 --> 02:05:17,013
You mean lreland.

1364
02:05:17,181 --> 02:05:19,183
Scotland, for God´s sake.

1365
02:05:19,183 --> 02:05:21,394
l´m messin´ with you, man.

1366
02:05:23,186 --> 02:05:25,022
Be sure to write.

1367
02:06:01,724 --> 02:06:03,226
What´s up, John?

1368
02:06:03,226 --> 02:06:05,229
You heard from William?

1369
02:06:05,229 --> 02:06:09,900
Yeah, but I don´t know what he´s doing.
He just checks up on the college recruiters.

1370
02:06:11,235 --> 02:06:14,237
I was just downstairs.
Looks like you got another one.

1371
02:06:14,237 --> 02:06:15,572
Word?

1372
02:06:16,239 --> 02:06:17,990
See you around.

1373
02:06:24,748 --> 02:06:27,459
-Steve Sanderson.
-How are you doing?

1374
02:06:27,751 --> 02:06:29,752
Thanks for coming down on short notice.

1375
02:06:29,752 --> 02:06:31,338
No problem.

1376
02:06:31,755 --> 02:06:33,256
What school are you from?

1377
02:06:33,256 --> 02:06:36,385
No. l´m a lawyer.
I work with Roberts & Carter.

1378
02:06:38,262 --> 02:06:39,263
-A lawyer.
-Yeah.

1379
02:06:39,263 --> 02:06:42,224
But congratulations on all that. lt´s great.

1380
02:06:44,268 --> 02:06:47,437
A bunch of guys in the office
are following you.

1381
02:06:49,272 --> 02:06:52,651
We´re the legal representation
for William Forrester.

1382
02:06:54,278 --> 02:06:55,821
How is he?

1383
02:06:56,781 --> 02:06:58,281
Sit down.

1384
02:07:04,787 --> 02:07:07,834
We´ve received word
that William passed away.

1385
02:07:19,303 --> 02:07:20,845
l´m sorry.

1386
02:07:27,310 --> 02:07:29,438
He wanted you to have...

1387
02:07:29,813 --> 02:07:32,065
...these things right away.

1388
02:07:47,330 --> 02:07:49,040
What happened?

1389
02:07:50,333 --> 02:07:52,252
William had cancer.

1390
02:07:54,338 --> 02:07:56,965
They found it a couple of years ago.

1391
02:08:07,851 --> 02:08:09,853
Jamal, this is crazy.

1392
02:08:10,353 --> 02:08:11,938
Oh, my God.

1393
02:08:16,359 --> 02:08:18,486
Look at all these books.

1394
02:08:18,862 --> 02:08:20,863
Don´t touch anything.

1395
02:09:39,441 --> 02:09:40,943
Dear Jamal..

1396
02:09:40,943 --> 02:09:44,448
Someone I once knew wrote
that we walk away from our dreams...

1397
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:48,285
...afraid that we may fail, or worse yet,
afraid we may succeed.

1398
02:09:49,953 --> 02:09:53,915
While I knew so very early on
that you would realise your dreams...

1399
02:09:54,457 --> 02:09:57,877
...I never imagined
I would once again realise my own.

1400
02:09:59,463 --> 02:10:00,964
Seasons change, young man.

1401
02:10:00,964 --> 02:10:05,552
While I waited until the winter of my life
to see what I´ve seen this past year...

1402
02:10:06,969 --> 02:10:11,265
...there is no doubt I would have
waited too long, had it not been for you.

1403
02:10:21,484 --> 02:10:23,861
You gonna be here awhile, man?

1404
02:10:27,490 --> 02:10:29,491
Just can´t watch the eyes this time.

1405
02:10:29,491 --> 02:10:31,828
You´ll be okay, man. Come on.

1406
02:10:34,997 --> 02:10:36,666
Come on, man.

1407
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:38,918
Get up.

1408
02:10:39,918 --> 02:10:49,918
