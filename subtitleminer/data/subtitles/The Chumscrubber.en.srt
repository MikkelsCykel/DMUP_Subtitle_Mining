1
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:28,180
This was the best
of all possible worlds.

2
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,849
But even here,
a little help was necessary.

3
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,916
And that's where
Troy came in.

4
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,500
Troy supplied feel-good pills
to all the kids at Hillside.

5
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,705
And, in this way,
happiness was spread all around.

6
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:06,784
Life could not possibly
be any more wonderful.

7
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:51,602
Lainie, listen, do you feel
like something's missing?

8
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,072
Has your energy level
been noticeably low lately?

9
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,701
Believe me, l know.

10
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,769
Lainie, believe me. Yes.

11
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,841
Right. So if you would
choose at this time

12
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,216
to upgrade to the
full platinum package,

13
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:11,246
you would start to see
the changes that l'm talking about.

14
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,594
No. No, l don't want you
to think of these as vitamins.

15
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,688
- Son of a bitch.
- Charlie!

16
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,359
l am doing VeggiForce.

17
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,863
- Level three.
- Yes!

18
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,962
Oh, absolutely.

19
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,506
Lainie, can l...?

20
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:31,943
Can l tell you, it has
completely changed my life?

21
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,479
You see?

22
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,779
lt has given me
an entirely new life system.

23
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:42,481
Good for you, Lainie.
Good for you! l'm so happy.

24
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,640
Oh, Dean, hello.
lt's wonderful to see you.

25
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,309
Troy's out back
in his little hideaway.

26
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,874
Dean, do me a favor.

27
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,113
Get him to turn his stereo
down a bit?

28
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,554
- Sure.
- Great. Thanks so much.

29
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,335
Troy?

30
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,956
Goodbye, Dean.

31
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,139
Goodbye, Mrs. Johnson.

32
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,782
Dean, l was hoping
to get your opinion on something.

33
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,516
Can you come in here
for a minute?

34
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,050
lt'll just take one second.

35
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,000
Publisher sent this over.

36
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:21,097
lt's for promotional events.
Book signings, lectures

37
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,334
TV.

38
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,071
You got a good eye.
What do you think? ls it too much?

39
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,079
What do you want, Dad?

40
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,618
Let's have a seat.

41
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,380
l want to talk to you about Troy.

42
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,426
- l told you everything already.
- You told us the facts.

43
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,893
We're interested in
how you feel about it.

44
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,396
- Dad, who's we?
- Your mother and l, of course.

45
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,433
And...

46
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,298
A lot of people.
You threw us all for a loop there, pal.

47
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,897
Hold on a second.
ls this a therapy session?

48
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,305
- ls that what you're doing?
- No, not at all.

49
00:07:56,376 --> 00:08:00,210
- You think l'm crazy?
- Of course not, Dean.

50
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,406
We're just talking here.
Man to man.

51
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,609
- Just talking?
- Absolutely.

52
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:05,742
Man to man?

53
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,880
OK.

54
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,088
Dean, l know Troy
was your best friend.

55
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,793
Actually, we weren't really friends.
We hung out sometimes, that's all.

56
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,302
Did you have a
better friend than him?

57
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,271
l don't really have any friends, Dad.
You know that.

58
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,332
So, strictly speaking,
Troy was your best friend.

59
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,605
And how do you feel
about the suicide

60
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,514
of your best friend
in the world?

61
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,142
Real shitty.

62
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,518
Come on, son,
make an effort for me.

63
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,615
Dad, l told you before.
l'm not all broken up about it.

64
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,355
l know l'm supposed to be.
l'm just not.

65
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,397
You're really not?

66
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:03,401
- No, l'm sorry...
- No, no. l...

67
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,445
l understand how someone
might respond like that.

68
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,883
What are you writing?

69
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,052
Dad, l thought we were just
talking man to man here.

70
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,214
Just one second.

71
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:26,458
Dad, if you write about me again
in another one of your stupid books,

72
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,261
l'm gonna kill you.

73
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:29,862
Stupid?

74
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,871
There are several major book
chains around this country

75
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,066
- that would disagree with you.
- All right.

76
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,609
The Happy Accident
will pay your college tuition.

77
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,645
- All right!
- Fine.

78
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,307
Let me ask you this.

79
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,579
Mrs. Johnson suspects that Troy

80
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:51,145
might have been selling drugs
to some of the kids at school.

81
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:54,591
- Yeah?
- How do you feel about that?

82
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,396
l feel then it must have
been unfulfilling for him.

83
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,491
That's very interesting.

84
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,092
Why do you say that?

85
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,161
Because he killed himself.

86
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:11,640
Dean, a young life was taken,
and from the moment it happened,

87
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,975
you ignored it like it was nothing.

88
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,606
You didn't even tell
any of the adults at the party.

89
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,946
- Can you explain?
- l didn't think you would...

90
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,645
- What?
- ...care!

91
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,251
This is called Viloprex.

92
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,920
Now, don't fight me on this,
l prescribe this to lots of kids.

93
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,964
You want me to take that?

94
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:35,330
lt's just something
to give you a little

95
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,561
balance.

96
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,005
OK, let me have it.

97
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,999
OK. Wonderful.

98
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,564
Lee, can l get some
by the end of the day?

99
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,129
Yeah, l'll see what l can do.

100
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,334
Lee. My dad's coming
to visit this weekend.

101
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,310
l understand, but our supply
is a little low right now.

102
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,372
Prozac, Haldol, it doesn't matter.
Anything to get me through till Monday.

103
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,281
- l'm almost out of Ritalin.
- Ritalin.

104
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,252
l gotta check.
l don't know if we have it.

105
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,480
l still got a few left.

106
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,319
- He's here all weekend.
- l'll see what l can do, man.

107
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,722
Got any Vicodin?

108
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:24,067
Hey! Psycho!

109
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,884
What happened to your boyfriend?

110
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,927
Come on, he's all tied up
and waiting for you, Dean.

111
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,891
Don't ignore me, Dean.

112
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,162
Don't ignore me!

113
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,644
Don't ignore me.

114
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,506
Here it is, Mrs. Bratley,

115
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,949
with all the changes,
exactly as you ordered.

116
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,112
l lowered the neckline
just a touch.

117
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,554
The crystal beading,
a special-order item,

118
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,615
but we have to talk
about that later.

119
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,662
The buttons,
which are covered...

120
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,196
Well, it's wonderful.

121
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,028
lt's absolutely wonderful.

122
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:24,963
Michael.

123
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,640
Michael.

124
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,236
Oh... yes.

125
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,973
l can see
the changes this time.

126
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,515
lt's just really... lt's amazing.

127
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,746
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
We had to put a lot of projects on hold,

128
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,380
but that's OK,
because l think it's really...

129
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,754
Michael, you didn't even look.

130
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,157
Anyway, the fit
will be exactly the same.

131
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,923
So, if you like,
l can ring it up for you now.

132
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,158
Can l see the veil
and the dress together?

133
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,564
Can l do that? Can l see
the two of them together?

134
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:59,070
l don't know that we can do
any more alterations before Sunday.

135
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,470
l just want to see
the two of them together.

136
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,701
l don't think
l'm being unreasonable.

137
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,368
Of course.

138
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,811
You all right?

139
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:20,089
l mean, after what
Billy did this morning?

140
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,787
lt's fine. l don't care.

141
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,559
- l'm Crystal.
- l know.

142
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,660
Everyone knows who you are.

143
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,499
You don't like
to talk much, do you?

144
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:39,066
Or is itjust that you
don't like talking to me?

145
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,669
What do you want?

146
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,180
l just want to say
l'm sorry, that's all.

147
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,845
- Oh, you were a part of that?
- No, but they're my friends.

148
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,151
- The guys who did it.
- Nice friends you have.

149
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,623
Well, better to
have no friends at all?

150
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:57,355
Honestly? Yeah.
Yeah, it is. Yeah.

151
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,989
You know that's why you
get so much shit, right?

152
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,798
The way you act like
you're smarter than everyone.

153
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,338
Well, l don't torment
people l don't know.

154
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,474
- l thought you said you didn't care.
- l'm talking about Troy.

155
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,013
Since you can't apologize
to him for this morning,

156
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,742
l guess apologizing to me

157
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,182
is enough to make yourself
feel better, right?

158
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,914
You know what?
l was really wrong.

159
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,149
You're definitely
not smarter than us.

160
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,624
And why is that?

161
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,684
Because Troy was my friend.

162
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,131
How'd you know Troy?

163
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,635
Are you apologizing to me now?

164
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,863
No.

165
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,135
You really don't care
what people think, do you?

166
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,074
No.

167
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,442
- That's a nice trick.
- Thanks.

168
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,538
l studied in the far East.

169
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,776
Maybe you could
show me how it's done.

170
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,478
Step one:
years of ridicule.

171
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,681
What if l start
by sitting next to you?

172
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:04,023
lt's probably not a good idea.

173
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,024
l'll take my chances.

174
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,830
- How do you eat that stuff?
- This?

175
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,836
Pretty much in the standard way.

176
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:22,108
You know, if l ate that every day,
l'd have a big, fat ass.

177
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,206
ls that your greatest fear?

178
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,912
No, but

179
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,818
it's my mom's greatest wish.

180
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:32,824
- That you be fat?
- No. Just fatter than her, anyway.

181
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,621
Sounds healthy.

182
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,597
ls it true that you found Troy?

183
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,635
- Why?
- l'm just

184
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,466
wondering what really happened.
- Just wondering?

185
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,508
You want me to tell you
a bunch of gory details, is that it?

186
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,169
lt's impossible
trying to talk to you.

187
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,303
You know,
l read this statistic

188
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,110
that the average kid
sees something like

189
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:00,277
10,000 dead bodies
on TV before he turns 18.

190
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,079
ls that what it was like?

191
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,527
Like TV?

192
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,828
No.

193
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,460
lt was nothing
like that at all, really.

194
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:21,171
How'd you know Troy?

195
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,476
Listen, Dean, l should
have asked you this...

196
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,775
Jesus! Crystal, just suck
his dick, why don't you?

197
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,781
- Billy.
- Did you ask him?

198
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,682
- Ask me what?
- Both of you guys get out of here, OK?

199
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,778
Oh. l don't
think she asked him.

200
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,221
Ask me what?
What are they talking about?

201
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:43,022
Here's the deal, psycho.
Troy has something we need,

202
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,690
and since you guys were
such good butt-buddies,

203
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,562
you're gonna go get it for us.

204
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,626
Get what?
Crystal, what's going on?

205
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:54,229
Pills, dipshit.

206
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:57,673
Pills, go get us the pills

207
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,041
and maybe l won't
have to kick your ass.

208
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,242
Crystal, you were right.

209
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,152
l'm really not as smart
as l thought l was.

210
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,019
l really believed you, you know?

211
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,185
- Wait, Dean...
- You were right about something else.

212
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,491
lt's not that
l don't like talking.

213
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,930
No. lt's just that
l don't like talking to you.

214
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:31,208
When l am designing
a family room,

215
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,904
or an outdoor seating area,

216
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,446
l think,
"What is the principle?"

217
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,574
- The principle?
- The guiding principle.

218
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:41,211
And l know you don't
think in these terms...

219
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,221
lt's about balance.

220
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,281
lt's all about balance.

221
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,723
Right.

222
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:51,121
- Michael.
- Yes, Terri?

223
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,027
Can you pick up
Charlie from school?

224
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,623
l think l'm gonna be here
a little while longer.

225
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,328
OK, sure.

226
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,133
Believe me, if l told you
the story of how we met,

227
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,435
l mean, you saw
the scar on his head?

228
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,807
He was almost killed.
And l rushed over...

229
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,357
Hey, listen, Lou...

230
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,419
Hey, just because you're the mayor,

231
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,293
it doesn't mean
you're above the law.

232
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,760
You have to let Terri
move on with her life.

233
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,667
You have to move on, yourself.

234
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,172
You might want to pay
that ticket right away.

235
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,504
l'd hate to have
to hit you with a warrant.

236
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,840
Hold on, Lou.
Let's talk about this.

237
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,362
- Two "F's" in Stiffle?
- Hurry up.

238
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,864
There's two Stiffles.

239
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,426
What?

240
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,938
There's two Stiffles.
Dean and Charlie.

241
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,837
Who the hell's Charlie?

242
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,061
F/A-18 Hornet.

243
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,122
Perfect vision. lt's a gift.

244
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,740
Which one of you
is Charlie?

245
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,506
- You're Charlie?
- Yeah.

246
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,279
Damn. You're teeny-tiny.

247
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,719
- Hey, you wanna come with us?
- No way.

248
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,513
Look what we got.

249
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,956
What?

250
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:05,292
- Goddamn it, Lee.
- There he is.

251
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,922
Come here.

252
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,665
Who the hell's that?

253
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,829
That is Dean's brother.

254
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,339
- Hi.
- Hi.

255
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,540
Shit. My parents.

256
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,277
- Those kids again, Lee?
- We're doing a group project.

257
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:32,280
With them, Lee? You think
they care what grades you get?

258
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:33,949
- Mom.
- Look, son,

259
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:37,689
you let your grades go now, maybe
you don't get into a top-tier school.

260
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:40,357
- Yeah.
- You don't get into a top-tier school,

261
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,866
maybe you got to settle
for a second-rate job.

262
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,199
Maybe you don't have
the life you want.

263
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,433
Maybe each and every day you wake up
and wanna crawl back into bed

264
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,975
and tell the world
to go to hell.

265
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:55,070
We're just saying, you've worked
too hard to blow it in your last year.

266
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,945
We've all worked hard together.

267
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:01,144
So, come on, champ,
hop in the car.

268
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,949
lt's for school.

269
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:08,286
Just look at our little man.

270
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,055
All right, Lee.

271
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,823
All right.

272
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,507
Sorry about that, Mr. Parker.

273
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,478
Can someone please
answer the goddamn phone?

274
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,212
Hello?

275
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,021
Ask for Dean.

276
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,560
ls Dean there, please?

277
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,495
Yes, he is.
Who may l say is calling?

278
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:55,556
- lt's Billy.
- One moment, please.

279
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:57,657
Dean?

280
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,933
Telephone.

281
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,607
Telephone, honey.
Some boy named Billy.

282
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,700
All right!

283
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,116
- What?
- Dean?

284
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,675
- What do you want?
- We got Charlie.

285
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,812
- Who?
- Your brother.

286
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,221
- We kidnapped your brother.
- What are you talking about, man?

287
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,453
l got him right now.
He's scared shitless.

288
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,723
Why did you kidnap my brother?

289
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,789
So you know l'm not fucking around.
l want the stuff from Troy.

290
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,893
- l all ready told you...
- l don't think you're listening.

291
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,097
You are going
to get me Troy's drugs.

292
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,640
- Or what?
- Don't push me, psycho.

293
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:40,235
- Or what?
- l'll kill him. l'm gonna kill him.

294
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,372
l'm not fucking around, man.
l swear to God!

295
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,746
l'll cut off
his fucking head!

296
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,546
Fine. Kill him.

297
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,521
- What did he say?
- Maybe he really is crazy.

298
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:03,659
- What did he say?
- He said for us to kill him.

299
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,616
So, who are you guys calling?

300
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,710
Your brother.

301
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:25,279
- Who?
- Your brother, Dean.

302
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,815
l don't have a brother.

303
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:33,388
- Charlie Stiffle?
- Charlie Bratley.

304
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:44,403
Michael. Honey?

305
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:49,435
Charlie, Mom's home.

306
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:57,711
Charlie. Do l see
your sheet music not put away?

307
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,221
Charlie, do l need
to make dinner?

308
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,861
Charlie?

309
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,869
You're supposed to be
the smart one, Lee.

310
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:21,174
We all messed up.
Just forget it already, OK?

311
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,611
lt's this one right here.

312
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:30,581
Thanks for the ride.
And the burger too.

313
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:31,917
Wait.

314
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,892
- l gotta get home...
- Will you shut up a minute?

315
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,986
Billy, he has
nothing to do with Dean.

316
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,122
Maybe that doesn't matter.

317
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,270
Charlie?

318
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,471
Charlie?

319
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,283
Honey, please open the door.

320
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:05,813
OK, l know this whole wedding thing
is not easy for you,

321
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:09,452
but it's not like l'm asking you
to think of Michael as your father.

322
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,496
Lou will always be your father.

323
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:17,633
- We're up here.
- Terri, l'm glad you're home.

324
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,294
l had to leave work.

325
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,033
lt's this book.
l just can't put it down.

326
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:26,305
- l was really hoping...
- Wonderful, honey. A little later?

327
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,741
Sweetheart, would you
open another bottle for us?

328
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,339
OK.

329
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:35,079
What does he do? Really?

330
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,919
And is he...? He is.

331
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:42,388
Yeah, well, l guess
l could meet him, at least.

332
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,294
Honey, l have to go. A bunch of
handsome young men just came to visit.

333
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:49,458
OK. Ciao, baby.

334
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:52,901
- Hello, boys.
- Hi, Mrs. Falls.

335
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:55,997
lt's Jerri, please.

336
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,304
- Who's this?
- That's Charlie.

337
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:01,243
Well, hello, Charlie.
l don't think we've met.

338
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,844
Hi.

339
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:06,509
So what sort of trouble
are you kids up to tonight?

340
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:11,249
We kidnapped Charlie to blackmail this
guy into giving us a stash of drugs.

341
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:12,756
Very funny.

342
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,291
Except, we got the wrong one.

343
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,156
We wanted to get Charlie Stiffle,

344
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:19,254
- but we ended up getting Charlie...
- Bratley.

345
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:20,958
Charlie Bratley.

346
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:25,093
Wait a minute, Bratley? ls...?
ls your mother Terri Bratley,

347
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,037
the designer,
Terri's lnterior Visions?

348
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,331
lsn't she getting married
to the mayor on Sunday?

349
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:35,607
- He's gonna stay here tonight, OK?
- Sure. No problem.

350
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,478
Can l get you anything?
Some blankets, pillows...

351
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,279
- Mom, we're fine.
- OK.

352
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:42,217
And what is this?

353
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:45,450
- lt's a tuba.
- Wow.

354
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:48,253
- Maybe we could have a concert later?
- Mom.

355
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:49,918
OK.

356
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:52,327
You kids have fun.
l am gonna put on my bikini.

357
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,892
Anybody wants
to go for a swim...

358
00:28:55,967 --> 00:29:00,063
But if you leave a message, l'll get
back to you as soon as l possibly can.

359
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:03,107
Hi, Terri. Mrs. Bratley, l'm sorry.

360
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,972
Your machine just cut me off.

361
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:09,878
My name is Jerri Falls, and l live
in the Ocean Crest development.

362
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,779
Anyway, l...

363
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:26,230
- This is Terri Bratley...
- Hi, l'm Jerri Falls...

364
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,337
- Hello?
- Dean?

365
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:42,846
Jesus. Can't you guys
just leave me alone?

366
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,179
- l'd love to, but l can't.
- Oh, yeah? Why not?

367
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,913
- l need your help.
- Yeah, l doubt that.

368
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,956
- You know it all, huh?
- What do you want?

369
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,120
You know how Billy said
he kidnapped your brother?

370
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,594
Yeah, that was
a pretty lame bullshitjob, huh?

371
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,255
Well, it wasn't all bullshit.

372
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:02,732
He did take a kid.
He just took the wrong one.

373
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,393
Wrong what?

374
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,130
The wrong kid.

375
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:09,071
Even though it has nothing
to do with you now,

376
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,199
he won't let him go.

377
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,743
l don't believe you.

378
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,473
Hold on.

379
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:19,005
Charlie! Charlie!

380
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:21,518
Billy, get off of him.

381
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,020
Charlie, come here.

382
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,129
- Hello?
- Who is this?

383
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,762
This is Charlie Bratley.

384
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,932
- Did those guys kidnap you?
- l think so.

385
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,340
- That sucks.
- l guess.

386
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:49,073
- Where do you live?
- 25720 Sunnycrest.

387
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,240
What do you mean?
l live on Sunnycrest.

388
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,614
Yeah. l know.

389
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,482
Put Crystal back on the phone.

390
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,719
Are you guys just fucking
with me again, or is this real?

391
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:05,594
No, l think this is pretty real.

392
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,281
- Yes?
- Hi. ls Charlie here?

393
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,684
He's not really in a talking mood.

394
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:32,723
- But he is here.
- l'm sorry. Who are you?

395
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,385
- l'm Dean.
- lsn't it kind of late?

396
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,894
lt's for school.

397
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,658
OK. Come right in.
See if he'll talk to you, at least.

398
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,530
His room is right there
at the top of the stairs.

399
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,591
- So, you're a friend of Charlie's?
- No, not exactly. No.

400
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,229
Yeah. Charlie doesn't have
a lot of friends yet.

401
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,136
He's not really socially gifted.

402
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:25,370
But he's a good kid, basically.

403
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,174
- Listen, l just...
- Good night. Thanks for coming.

404
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,714
No, no, no. l'm still here.

405
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,613
Wait, l've got an idea.

406
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,619
Have you eaten yet?
Why don't you stay for dinner?

407
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:38,383
Honey, l don't think tonight
is the best night.

408
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,016
But l can get that
special-ordered, right?

409
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:43,353
Oh, Michael.

410
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,216
l don't care if you have
to fly it in from the moon.

411
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,121
Have it here by Sunday.
Thank you.

412
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:17,423
Terri, wait. Wait.

413
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,492
ls there anything else?

414
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,835
Yeah. Could you
tell Charlie l said goodbye?

415
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:31,899
- OK.
- OK.

416
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:52,251
Hello, Allie.

417
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,527
Carrie, hi. How are you?

418
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,625
- Am l interrupting?
- No, come in.

419
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,670
l'm just in the middle
of making dinner.

420
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:03,195
- Would you like a glass of wine?
- Well, l left the car running.

421
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,367
l just wanted to come back

422
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,673
and return your dish
and say thank you.

423
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:11,772
lt has been such a relief
to not have to cook lately.

424
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:15,376
Everyone has been so nice.

425
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:21,491
What?

426
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,186
This dish...

427
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,761
Oh! Oh, my God.

428
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,526
This is not the right one?

429
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,397
l got so many, l mean,

430
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,062
l've been driving around
all night returning them.

431
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,697
Like l say,
everyone has been so nice.

432
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,833
l don't believe
l brought over a casserole.

433
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:45,247
Can you hang on
just one second, Carrie?

434
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,396
Allie, am l making a mistake here?

435
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,833
Bill and l were meaning
to come over, really.

436
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,733
You just get so busy.

437
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,666
No, but l'm certain.

438
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:12,904
l mean, you came over,
we had coffee.

439
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:16,276
We talked, right?

440
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,173
Or am l

441
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,685
just imagining
the whole thing?

442
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,655
ls that what l'm doing here?
Am l just

443
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,886
imagining all of it?

444
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,363
l'm sorry, Carrie.
You just get so busy sometimes.

445
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:36,025
l'm so embarrassed.

446
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,193
l don't know what l was thinking.

447
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,760
Here you are, preparing
a nice family dinner...

448
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,703
Would you like
to stay and eat with us?

449
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:45,834
And l come in and interrupt
everything with no reason at all.

450
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,901
- Why don't you stay?
- l really can't.

451
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,742
l have so many dishes to return.

452
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:53,682
Everyone has been just
so unbelievably nice.

453
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:58,581
- So, we'll see you on Sunday?
- Sunday?

454
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:03,025
Don't tell me that
l forgot your invitation too?

455
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,927
Troy's memorial.
lt's this Sunday.

456
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:10,627
Of course, Carrie.
Right. We're looking forward...

457
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,569
We'll be there.

458
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,663
And

459
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:20,609
l wanted to let you know,
just in case you were wondering...

460
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,407
Yes?

461
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,347
ln no way, whatsoever,

462
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,317
do l blame you for Troy's death.

463
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,682
Good night.

464
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:44,799
Crystal, come over here.
We're gonna have a concert.

465
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,861
- l'm fine here, Mom.
- Baby, don't be shy.

466
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,734
She's been filling out
a little bit lately.

467
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,176
Which is completely
natural for your age.

468
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:58,113
l just hope l look
as good as you at 35, Mom.

469
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,877
Go ahead, Charlie.

470
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,180
Yeah?

471
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,845
l mean, you are 35, right?

472
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,446
Actually, l'm 39,
sweetheart, you know that.

473
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:10,483
- You're 39?
- Anytime, Charlie.

474
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,552
l don't have my sheet music.

475
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,962
The only one l know
by heart is Tequila.

476
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:18,297
Well, for someone almost 40,
you look great, Mom.

477
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,897
Well, thank you so much, sweetheart.

478
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:26,239
- 40 years old. Wow.
- There's no real... l don't know.

479
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,336
The marching band,
the melody doesn't go to the tuba.

480
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:32,679
- We know the tune. We'll recognize it.
- More wine, Jerri?

481
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,583
l would love some.
You are such a charmer.

482
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:40,289
Did you know l'm going
to the Air Force after graduation?

483
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,723
- Did you know that?
- No.

484
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:44,159
They accepted me for
the pilot training program.

485
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,093
Just like your dad, right?

486
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:50,100
No. No, he was just a mechanic.

487
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:53,501
He couldn't even pass the eye test,
but me, perfect vision.

488
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:54,936
20/20.

489
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,997
- lt's a gift.
- lt's wonderful.

490
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:59,406
Just wonderful.

491
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:03,805
- Miss Falls?
- Jerri, please.

492
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,145
Any time. Let's do it.

493
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,587
The Chumscrubber.

494
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,696
l live in the city.

495
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:27,204
ln an apartment above
the cloud left by the blast.

496
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,640
l'm one of the lucky ones.

497
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:33,274
One morning,

498
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:37,713
l woke to find that my head
was no longer attached to my body.

499
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,390
l'm not dead,
but who could call this a life?

500
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,399
Get ready to die.

501
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,473
So l did what l had to do.

502
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:09,707
ln a world of freaks
and subhuman creatures

503
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,855
l became the Chumscrubber.

504
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,186
Chumscrubber.

505
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,507
- Hello?
- Crystal?

506
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,016
- Yeah, it's me.
- Hi...

507
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,645
Listen, l just want
to ask you something.

508
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,621
When this whole thing is over

509
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,181
and we see each other
at school, or wherever...

510
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:57,623
Yeah?

511
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,061
l don't really
know how to say this...

512
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,827
No, what is it?

513
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,232
Well, it's...

514
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,897
Can you just

515
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,002
leave me alone?

516
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,105
- What?
- No, l mean it.

517
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:21,640
- Leave me alone.
- l didn't mean for this all to happen.

518
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,710
Don't try to act
like you know me.

519
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,313
Don't bother me,
don't ever talk to me again.

520
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,382
Why the hell would l want
to talk to someone like you?

521
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:31,955
Exactly.

522
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,928
l'll get you
Troy's pills tomorrow.

523
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,725
Let's go, Michael. We have
a million things to do today.

524
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,925
Terri, could we
slow down for a minute?

525
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,934
- l was up all night...
- Morning!

526
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,527
l really want
to talk to you about this book.

527
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,631
Certainly a lot of activity
around your house lately.

528
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,903
Well, l am getting
married tomorrow.

529
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:55,172
l know.
That's just so wonderful.

530
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,476
l did want to ask,
l don't mean to be rude...

531
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,311
- Go ahead.
- Well...

532
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:03,752
Your people are parking
just wherever they like.

533
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,016
And the cleaning crew?

534
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:09,389
Those Mexican folks,
they backed right into my yard.

535
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,122
Look, you can see.
Just right up over the flowers.

536
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,357
Not a word of apology.

537
00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:18,459
You mind if we deal
about this a little bit later on?

538
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,403
l didn't mean to cause
a problem, especially now,

539
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:24,373
while you're preparing
for your wonderful wedding.

540
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:26,637
l have a million things to do today.

541
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:27,905
l know what you mean,

542
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:30,674
because l'm having the service
for my son tomorrow

543
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:32,978
and l have things
to prepare, as well.

544
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,713
And l will definitely
need my fair share

545
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:39,722
of parking spaces
for my guests.

546
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:43,487
- l understand.
- l don't mean to be a nuisance.

547
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,292
- Not at all.
- But l did want to tell you,

548
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:50,697
just in case you're wondering,
in no way, whatsoever...

549
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:51,996
Point taken!

550
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,965
l can't believe
the nerve of that woman.

551
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,134
She knew
it was my wedding this Sunday.

552
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,838
Can't she find another date
for her memorial?

553
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:06,440
Dean? Honey? Breakfast!

554
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:37,071
Were you watching me?

555
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,572
No.

556
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:44,715
l must've been slobbering
all over myself like a retard, huh?

557
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,086
You look nice.

558
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:49,493
l bet.

559
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:58,229
- Come smoke with me.
- OK.

560
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,704
Have a seat, it's all ready.

561
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,766
- Turn off your game now.
- Shit, Mom.

562
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:09,540
What did l tell you about
swearing in this house?

563
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:12,013
- You're against it?
- Right. l am against it.

564
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,550
- l'm not hungry.
- Just have some eggs, then.

565
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,108
- OK, l've gotta go.
- What?

566
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:20,123
l've got a meeting with the agents.
We're talking foreign distribution.

567
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:21,681
Bill, it's Saturday.

568
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,990
l was hoping we could all
do something together as a family.

569
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:27,792
- l'm not going anywhere.
- Has anyone seen my case?

570
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,856
- That's a great attitude.
- Welcome.

571
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:34,030
- l just brought it out. l just had it.
- Dean, you have to eat something.

572
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,731
l just said l'm not hungry.

573
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,036
lt's just a side effect
of the medication.

574
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:41,168
lsn't there a more natural way
we could treat his problem?

575
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:44,043
- My problem?
- A bunch of vitamins isn't gonna help.

576
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:45,775
They're notjust vitamins.

577
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,182
l could really use
an extra set of eyes here.

578
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:52,382
- l could make you some pancakes.
- Mom, no, l don't want pancakes.

579
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,617
l'm fine, Mom. l'm fine.

580
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,593
- Anyway, l have to go.
- What? No.

581
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:01,062
- Where are you going?
- Do l have to explain everything l do?

582
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:04,032
- l'm just meeting some friends.
- Really?

583
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:07,366
- Don't act too surprised, Mom.
- No, why would l be?

584
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,872
- 'Cause no one likes him, Mom.
- Oh, Charlie.

585
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,737
Everyone thinks he's crazy.

586
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,334
l'm asking everyone.
Has anyone seen my case?

587
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:17,938
lt's right here on the goddamn,
son-of-a-bitch counter!

588
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,278
All right, Mom.

589
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:25,220
- How old are you?
- Thirteen.

590
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:28,952
- Then why are you so small?
- l don't know.

591
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,618
Just am.

592
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:34,391
My dad put me on this
Bulk 2000 for awhile,

593
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:36,660
this powder stuff,

594
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:40,397
it ended up costing him $400,
but after a couple of weeks,

595
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,769
l got really bad diarrhea.

596
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,776
l ended up losing, like, eight pounds.

597
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,909
My dad went ballistic.

598
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:55,542
You don't smoke, do you?

599
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:59,453
Sure. Well, no.

600
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,914
Here's a secret.

601
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:06,061
Don't act like
somebody you're not.

602
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:09,827
You do that long enough,
you'll forget you were acting.

603
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,233
And so will everyone else.

604
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,844
l was actually thinking
of going out for marching band.

605
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,718
Seems that's what the chicks
are into, right?

606
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:37,784
Yeah, that's right, Billy.
Charlie nailed me all night long.

607
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:40,386
lt was unreal.

608
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,305
What the hell
did you do that for?

609
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,500
'Cause l'm a stupid bastard.

610
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:57,504
Let's get the fuck
out of this place.

611
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:04,277
Charlie...

612
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:10,417
My mom gave this to me
on my 12th birthday.

613
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:17,089
l always hated
this stupid thing.

614
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:40,214
Hello, Debbie?
lt's Carrie. Johnson.

615
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,315
Oh, l guess it is early.

616
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:46,693
Right. Well, l'm calling
because l just wanted to tell you,

617
00:47:46,764 --> 00:47:50,165
in case you were wondering,
that in no way, whatsoever,

618
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:52,065
do l blame you for Troy's death.

619
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:42,316
Hello, Timmy?
ls your mommy there?

620
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:46,585
Well, can you take
a message, sweetie?

621
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:50,058
All right, write this down.

622
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,685
ln no way...

623
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:07,274
Don't ignore me, Dean.

624
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,904
l didn't know we were entertaining.

625
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:27,815
We're just going
to my room for a while.

626
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:29,078
Who's the kid?

627
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,985
- Charlie.
- Damn, you're teeny-tiny.

628
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:34,922
l'm holding him for ransom.

629
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:38,826
Yeah, l should probably get home.
My mom's getting married tomorrow.

630
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:41,693
l was married once.

631
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,029
Problem was,
if my wife never really...

632
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,591
We're just gonna go inside.

633
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:48,596
l'm sorry.

634
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,663
Come on, let's go.

635
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:26,106
Come here, shitballs.
l'm gonna teach you something.

636
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,606
Come here.

637
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:32,148
Come here.

638
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:39,212
Listen, if someone tries
to kick your ass in high school...

639
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:42,349
To be honest, you're probably
gonna get your ass kicked anyway.

640
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:45,259
But if you weren't such a pussy,
you could try this.

641
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:48,924
All right. Come at me
like you're gonna hit me in the chest.

642
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:53,459
Hit me right here in the chest.
Come on, hit me right here.

643
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:56,506
No, man, like really do it
like you got a pair.

644
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:59,201
Really do it.
Come on, come on.

645
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:02,770
Billy!

646
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,677
That was good. That was good.

647
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:07,410
- He's about half your size.
- Are you all right?

648
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,452
Are you fucking kidding me?

649
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,955
What are we doing here?
We're fucking kidnapping this kid.

650
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,491
Am l the only one
that fucking remembers that?

651
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:18,187
You're such a dick, Billy.

652
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:36,608
What the hell is wrong with you?

653
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,883
Billy, get off of him!

654
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,421
Hey!

655
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,192
Who put that knife in the wall?

656
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:53,485
l did.

657
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,225
- You're gonna fix that.
- lt's my room.

658
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:57,789
No, this is not your room.

659
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,635
This is a room in my house.

660
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:03,036
This is my room.

661
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:04,937
So then you can fix it.

662
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:14,076
Come on. Come on.

663
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:38,408
- l'm getting concerned about Charlie.
- Oh, yeah?

664
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:41,808
Yeah, he just seems
so angry lately.

665
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,043
Jeez, it's the florist.

666
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,347
Yeah, you're running
a little behind?

667
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,410
No kidding.
How about a little fired?

668
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:55,788
- How is he with you? Any better?
- l haven't seen him much lately.

669
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:59,556
- You must've talked yesterday.
- No, we didn't talk at all.

670
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,223
Jerri Falls?

671
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:06,326
Then that is just plain rude. l'm gonna
have to have a little talk with him.

672
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:09,031
See that one? lt's not bad,
if you're on a budget.

673
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,436
What's rude?

674
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:12,941
Jesus, this woman keeps calling me.

675
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:15,341
When you picked Charlie up.

676
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,812
- When?
- From school.

677
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:20,577
He wasn't there.

678
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,811
What do you mean?
You didn't pick him up?

679
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:25,684
l figured he walked.
l saw you guys talking last night.

680
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,155
Come on. This is ridiculous.

681
00:55:29,593 --> 00:55:32,892
Oh, goddamn it.

682
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:34,487
l see you, Lou!

683
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:37,658
Don't think l don't
see what you're doing.

684
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:40,828
Can't you see l don't
fucking love you anymore?

685
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:48,542
Let's go. Chop, chop.

686
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:02,086
Look at this.

687
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:05,491
The First Couple of Hillside
right here at my front door.

688
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:08,053
- Hello.
- Hi, l'm Terri Bratley.

689
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:10,622
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my fiance, Michael.

690
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,466
Of course, l know the mayor.
lt is an honor, sir, an honor.

691
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:17,166
l apologize
for any inconvenience with Charlie.

692
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:21,643
lt has been such a pleasure
getting to know your son.

693
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,576
He is such a nice boy.

694
00:56:23,647 --> 00:56:27,674
- And he's so talented and so nice.
- Thank you.

695
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:31,243
- l really like him, he's lovely.
- ls he all set?

696
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:33,653
- Charlie!
- Well, actually...

697
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,852
They just went
gallivanting off somewhere.

698
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:41,091
l'm sure he's fine.
They're having so much fun together.

699
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:44,327
l'm sure. lt's just that l have
a million things to do today.

700
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,837
- My God. This house.
- What? What's wrong?

701
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:51,203
This is where we met.
This is where it all started.

702
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:55,040
- This is... This is where...
- Oh, you're right, Michael.

703
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:59,707
- You're absolutely right.
- What an amazing coincidence.

704
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:03,014
Believe me. lf l told you
the story of how we met...

705
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,986
- You saw the scar on his head?
- Yes.

706
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:09,185
He was almost killed
and l rushed over, it was so romantic.

707
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,636
lt's the perfect arrangement.

708
00:57:57,707 --> 00:58:01,473
l'll design the next development,
he'll fast-track the permits.

709
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:04,377
lt doesn't hurt
that he's so good-looking, right?

710
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:07,644
- A woman only gets married once, right?
- Yes.

711
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:09,378
And if that doesn't work out,

712
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:12,615
it's a woman's prerogative
to go all out on the next one.

713
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:16,559
Will there be very many
single men at your wedding?

714
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:19,720
- Well, would you like to come?
- l would...

715
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:22,731
- Would that be OK?
- Of course, l don't see why not.

716
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,267
That would be...

717
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,996
Oh, my God.

718
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:31,537
Michael, what happened?

719
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:34,099
- Nothing, nothing.
- Did you fall in the pool?

720
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,270
No, l... Yes, l fell in.

721
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,610
l'm gonna get you a towel.

722
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:40,616
What's the matter with you?

723
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:43,619
Something big is happening.

724
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,985
What?

725
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:49,753
l feel like there's
another person inside me.

726
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:53,728
Jesus Christ, get a hold of yourself.
This is embarrassing.

727
00:58:53,797 --> 00:58:58,325
You should really take your shirt off.
You're gonna catch a cold.

728
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:01,029
ls that good? You're so wet.

729
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,129
We're leaving.

730
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,137
ls he...? ls he OK?

731
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,270
He's fine.
He just hasn't eaten all day.

732
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:13,713
- He's a diabetic.
- l'm not a diabetic.

733
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:17,480
lf your energy level is low,
l have these wonderful vitamins...

734
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,949
What the hell's wrong with you?

735
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,457
Psycho.

736
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:05,329
- Hello?
- Crystal?

737
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:08,837
l got it. Let's just meet at the
Promenade and get this over with.

738
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:13,103
l don't know how we got here,
but l just wanted to say l'm sorry.

739
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:17,669
My dad would probably say

740
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:20,375
there's some great
cosmic reason for all this.

741
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,577
And we'll all be better people, right?

742
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:25,212
Well, l don't know.

743
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:28,281
My dad also says l'm crazy.

744
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:31,589
Dean, you're not crazy.

745
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:37,733
There are several major book chains
around the country

746
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:40,964
that would probably
disagree with you on that point.

747
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:44,837
l'm my dad's favorite subject and...

748
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,936
l have to go.

749
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:50,271
- Dean.
- l'll meet you at the mall.

750
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:56,041
lt's just a beer, Mom.

751
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:59,316
You don't have to explain
yourself to me. l trust you.

752
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:04,422
l wonder what that would be like.

753
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,224
lf we could just switch roles and

754
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:11,700
you could be the parent
and l would be the child

755
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:14,168
and you could tell me what to do

756
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:17,365
and l would listen to you
and l would trust you.

757
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,200
Are you OK?

758
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:28,014
l'm supposed to be making
a casserole now

759
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:29,984
for Troy's memorial service.

760
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:32,180
l don't know
what's wrong with me.

761
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:37,192
My basic energy level's
been noticeably low lately.

762
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,205
Mom, l'm sorry.

763
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,537
- l have to go.
- Nope.

764
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:55,737
Do not explain yourself to me,
l told you not to do that.

765
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:47,688
F-17 Tigershark.

766
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:50,761
He's here.

767
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,843
Took you long enough.

768
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:09,341
Here, this is
everything Troy had.

769
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:14,513
ls this the kid?

770
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:17,218
Yeah, that's him.

771
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:20,285
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

772
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:22,058
Fine.

773
01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:25,933
Wait a minute. Wait.

774
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:29,130
- What?
- What is this shit?

775
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:32,265
- What? lt's all there.
- VeggiForce?

776
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:36,171
- What are you doing?
- Yeah, this whole bag here.

777
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,372
You trying to give me
stupid vitamins?

778
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:41,144
They're notjust vitamins.
No, no.

779
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:44,311
This is an entirely new life system.

780
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,889
Billy, leave him alone.

781
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:53,553
- Kick his ass.
- Shit.

782
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:55,824
Billy, get off of him.

783
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,747
Stop! Stop it.
What are you doing to him?

784
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:15,147
- That dude's crazy.
- l saw the whole thing.

785
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:18,278
- He started hitting for no reason.
- Let go of me!

786
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,788
Get off of me!

787
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,451
You stay right here.
Honey, honey call the cops.

788
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,427
Crystal! Hey!

789
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:29,897
Get off of me! Crystal!

790
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:00,962
OK, so, now, you want to tell me
about this fight at the mall?

791
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,725
No, not really.

792
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:05,791
Dean, make an effort for me, please.

793
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:09,463
l'm sure there is a reasonable
explanation for this, officer.

794
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:11,632
l'm all ears.

795
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:14,301
Dean?

796
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,070
The guy at the mall was Billy.

797
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:21,344
He and the other two forced me
to steal drugs from Troy.

798
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,385
Troy? Who's this Troy?

799
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:27,719
- Troy Johnson. He's dead.
- He committed suicide, sir.

800
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:30,350
l don't understand.

801
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:34,453
l told them no, so to force me to do it,
they kidnapped my brother.

802
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:37,727
Wait, are you kidding me?
You got a son who's kidnapped?

803
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,667
No, wait a second, listen.
They got the wrong kid.

804
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:44,570
They said if l didn't get the stuff
from Troy, they were gonna kill him.

805
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,404
- You just said Troy was dead.
- He is, officer.

806
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:50,969
- Dean...
- So l did it, only Charlie

807
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:54,778
my little brother, Charlie,
switched the drugs on me.

808
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:57,649
And l wound up with a bag
of my mom's VeggiForce.

809
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,655
- VeggiForce?
- lt's this vitamin line that she hocks.

810
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:03,283
VeggiForce! l know that stuff.

811
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,691
Right, l know, VeggiForce, right. OK.

812
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:09,094
Yeah. You don't know,
do they make a weight gainer for kids?

813
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:12,601
- l could check, l guess.
- Anyway, that's why we got in a fight.

814
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:15,262
- 'Cause he wouldn't let the kid go.
- Which kid?

815
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:16,896
The kid who was kidnapped.

816
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,999
OK. l think l understand.

817
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:22,670
You were fighting
with a guy who's kidnapping

818
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:25,373
and drug smuggling
with a guy who killed himself.

819
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:27,939
- Yeah.
- Well, that's great, Dean, you know?

820
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:31,748
Only there don't happen to be
any reports around here of missing kids,

821
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:34,585
so how do you explain that?

822
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:38,885
l can't. l can't explain that.

823
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:41,953
Officer, can l...?

824
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:44,898
What's his name,
this missing kid? What's his name?

825
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:46,559
- Charlie.
- Charlie what?

826
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:49,537
Officer Bratley,
could you step outside a minute?

827
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:52,631
- l'd like to talk to you in private.
- Officer Bratley?

828
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:54,403
Can you make
some sense out of this?

829
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:58,174
- l believe l can, yes.
- All right.

830
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:02,584
- You stay put.
- Yeah.

831
01:07:34,951 --> 01:07:37,044
l kinda wanna go home now.

832
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:42,657
l'm not having fun anymore.

833
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:57,772
Billy.

834
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:10,978
Well, at least
let me set you a plate.

835
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:17,749
Listen, l spoke to a colleague
of mine at the hospital.

836
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:21,263
These are a stronger version
of what l've already given you,

837
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:23,924
but, listen,
they're perfectly safe, OK, pal?

838
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,539
Look, Terri, if l could
just talk to you here.

839
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,516
Michael, l'm just gonna take a bath, OK?

840
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:46,043
- lt's been a long day.
- Terri, we have to talk!

841
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:49,956
Michael, l have done absolutely
everything to prepare for our wedding.

842
01:08:50,026 --> 01:08:52,460
Everything!
All you have to do is show up.

843
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:54,996
OK? That's it. Show up.

844
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:02,599
Please don't leave me,
please don't leave me.

845
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:10,139
- You are gonna listen to me.
- No.

846
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:11,611
lt's about the day we met.

847
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,812
There's something
l never told you.

848
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:24,787
Have you seen my son, Charlie?

849
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:29,229
Hillside is growing.
And this is what it's all about.

850
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:33,826
This new Ocean Crest development
is exactly what...

851
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:45,508
l am so sorry about this, Mr. Mayor.

852
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:47,777
Michael.

853
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:50,752
l'm Terri.

854
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:54,813
Bratley,
from Terri's lnterior Visions and

855
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:58,485
l actually designed all of this.

856
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:01,052
Wonderful.

857
01:10:11,107 --> 01:10:15,203
l feel... l feel so different.

858
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:37,088
Look at this. The footprints...

859
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:39,100
- Yeah?
- Look, it's like...

860
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:42,399
- Yeah, look at this.
- Like dolphins.

861
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:44,905
Dolphins, that's right.

862
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:46,532
Dolphin.

863
01:10:59,155 --> 01:11:04,718
"To begin, each of us alike,
to actually conjure magic.

864
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:10,688
This must finally be our goal
as free-willed beings.

865
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:15,795
The joyous acceptance
of a pure state of synchronicity,

866
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:21,503
through the seemingly random
happy accidents of our lives."

867
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:24,437
Don't you see?

868
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:26,904
Nothing is random.

869
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:31,715
Nothing happens by chance.
There is a power at work here.

870
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:34,654
A power greater than all of us.

871
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:39,594
Don't you see what this means?

872
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,857
l just love you so much.

873
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,367
l was so scared.

874
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:02,646
Tomorrow

875
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:06,051
l'll show you everything.

876
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:57,900
Yes, l am Dr. Stiffle. Yeah.

877
01:12:57,973 --> 01:13:00,999
You know my book?
So you've heard of me?

878
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:03,271
And my book.

879
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:06,906
Yes, yes. l see that
you are familiar with my work.

880
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:21,486
"To actually conjure magic."

881
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:29,543
- Terri?
- Honey.

882
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,251
Now, do you see my vision?

883
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,902
Dean, Charlie, breakfast.

884
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:04,850
- lt's not coming off.
- l thought you understood.

885
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:08,856
Do we have any paint thinner?
Go to the garage and look for some.

886
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:10,858
- Paint thinner.
- Paint thinner?

887
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:12,757
Or maybe some white paint?

888
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:16,059
We'll just put a coat
of white paint over all of it...

889
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:18,964
- And no one'll see it.
- You're not making any sense.

890
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:22,936
- Why in the world would you do that?
- Don't answer it.

891
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:25,997
- Don't answer it.
- You need to calm down.

892
01:17:28,277 --> 01:17:30,939
- Where's the beautiful bride?
- Hello. Come in.

893
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:34,645
How wonderful, the dress.

894
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:23,086
Guys, l really need to
talk to you about something.

895
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:24,894
Where are the keys?

896
01:18:24,967 --> 01:18:26,935
lt's about that kid, Charlie.

897
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:30,369
l think we kinda kidnapped him.

898
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:31,838
Here they are.

899
01:18:31,907 --> 01:18:34,375
That's not funny, Lee.

900
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:36,841
Listen to me!

901
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:39,437
We've had him since Friday.

902
01:18:40,249 --> 01:18:42,979
l don't know what to do.

903
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:46,384
All right, let's just calm down.
l'm sure you didn't have a part

904
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:48,787
of whatever those kids
are doing down there.

905
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:52,384
ltjust started out as a joke. l didn't
think Billy was really gonna do it.

906
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:54,554
- A joke?
- Wait a minute.

907
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:56,962
ls this a kidnapping or not?

908
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:59,296
That sort of thing
doesn't happen around here.

909
01:18:59,368 --> 01:19:01,666
lf it is,
l'm going to have to call the police.

910
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,728
- The police?
- ln our home?

911
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:05,796
Just a minute.
l'm talking to Lee.

912
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:09,810
Lee, is it a joke or not?

913
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:14,440
No. lt's nothing.

914
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:17,542
No, you don't have to call anybody.

915
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:22,685
Well, l, for one,
did not find that very funny at all.

916
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,851
And neither would a top-tier school.

917
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,589
You guys, just go.

918
01:19:27,663 --> 01:19:30,291
Everything is totally fine.

919
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:32,026
Our little man.

920
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:37,094
Yeah, we'll always be here for you.

921
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:42,574
l don't know why
it came to me as a dolphin.

922
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:47,047
lt's just a sign.
lt could have been anything.

923
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:50,209
But now l'm aware
of a connection

924
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:52,276
that l didn't
even know was missing.

925
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:54,948
Maybe we've all been missing it.

926
01:19:55,023 --> 01:19:57,048
Lou, l'm so glad you're here.

927
01:19:57,125 --> 01:20:00,219
- We need to talk.
- Now is not a good time.

928
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:03,287
Talk to Lou. We need
to get some closure here.

929
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:06,027
Closure? Where's Charlie?
Where is he?

930
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:08,934
Excuse me, could you help me
hold up this end, please?

931
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:11,029
Hey, l'm getting married today.

932
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:14,371
l love Michael now,
l thought l made that perfectly clear.

933
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:19,142
- Where is Charlie?
- l don't know...

934
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:22,615
- Why don't you know? ls he missing?
- No, he's not missing!

935
01:20:22,684 --> 01:20:25,710
- Where is he?
- He is just out gallivanting.

936
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:28,813
Gosh, darn it, honey,
you pierced his dorsal.

937
01:20:31,693 --> 01:20:34,253
Let's see some fuckin' blood, already.

938
01:20:45,907 --> 01:20:50,537
l probably would've been with some
football player, if l hadn't met you.

939
01:20:50,612 --> 01:20:54,844
And l guess l just want to thank you
for keeping it interesting for me.

940
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:58,181
lt's definitely not the usual thing.

941
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:00,983
Who wants that, right?

942
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:03,422
What the fuck
are you talking about?

943
01:21:03,492 --> 01:21:05,824
Let's just stop, Billy.

944
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:09,352
Let's just quit this thing with Charlie,
forget about the pills.

945
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:12,594
And everything. Let's just stop.

946
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,635
OK?

947
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:17,194
lt's over.

948
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:19,898
Sit down!

949
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:29,280
Guess it doesn't matter what you think.

950
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,179
Lee.

951
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:42,019
Good. Sit right down,
what can l get you?

952
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:44,759
Charlie, Bill!
lt's getting cold.

953
01:21:47,169 --> 01:21:48,500
Good morning.

954
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:51,562
Do you think that's appropriate
for a memorial service?

955
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,234
l think l'll shoot on over
to the wedding instead.

956
01:21:54,309 --> 01:21:55,936
What are you talking about?

957
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:58,844
l covered death
extensively in my first two books.

958
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:01,849
l've done grieving to death.

959
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,249
Maybe l'll get a few insights
at the wedding.

960
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:07,254
Multiple marriage couples.
Gotta be a new book in there.

961
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:09,916
How is it going to look
if we don't go to the memorial?

962
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:12,255
lf it means that much,
you go ahead and go.

963
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,488
We should all go
together as a family.

964
01:22:14,563 --> 01:22:18,727
l understand your feelings. Maybe
you could make the same effort for me.

965
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,098
Dean, it looks like
you have a choice to make.

966
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:24,366
The wedding with him
or the memorial with me.

967
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:28,671
Dean, it's your decision,
him or me.

968
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:30,734
l think it's best
if he stayed home today.

969
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:33,474
He can make up his mind.
He's practically an adult.

970
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:37,609
As a therapist, it's my opinion
that he should avoid anything upsetting.

971
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:41,816
As a mother, it's fucking important he
learn how to function in the real world.

972
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:45,587
l'm not going to get into an argument
with you now.

973
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:48,788
Let's not argue.
Let's sit down and have a meal together.

974
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:44,977
- Hello?
- Hi, is Dean here?

975
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:49,282
- lt's for school.
- Well, go ahead then.

976
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,518
He's up the stairs
at the end of the hall.

977
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:54,323
Could you do me a favor?

978
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:58,355
Would you get him to turn down his
stereo down a bit? Thanks so much.

979
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:21,755
Crystal, come on in.

980
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:27,117
Dean, l need your help.

981
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:32,299
- lt's Troy, look, Troy's back.
- That's not funny.

982
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:35,768
Crystal, you remember Troy?
You guys were friends, right?

983
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:38,567
She wasn't my friend.
ls that what she said?

984
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:42,201
Oh, Troy says
you guys weren't friends.

985
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:45,969
Dean, there's nobody here.

986
01:24:46,047 --> 01:24:48,072
Tell her to fuck off.

987
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:51,942
l don't think Troy wants
to see you right now.

988
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:54,511
Troy is dead.
l mean, he killed himself.

989
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:57,217
No, no, no. He's back.
He's not dead.

990
01:24:57,292 --> 01:25:00,318
- Troy, tell her you're not dead.
- l am not dead.

991
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:02,363
You see, Crystal?

992
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:05,263
But who could call this a life?

993
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:08,130
Here we go.

994
01:25:27,155 --> 01:25:29,885
- Troy?
- Dean, stop it.

995
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:32,724
What do you want?

996
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:36,958
Look, this wasn't my fault, OK?

997
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:40,260
He didn't even tell me, OK?

998
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:42,098
He was my best friend,

999
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:46,038
and he didn't even tell me
he was gonna kill himself.

1000
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:48,769
l could've stopped him.

1001
01:25:50,378 --> 01:25:54,212
l wish l could've stopped him.

1002
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,652
l'm sorry.

1003
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:13,357
Charlie's gonna get hurt.

1004
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:26,005
Nobody else cares.

1005
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,534
- We become adults.
- OK.

1006
01:27:20,602 --> 01:27:22,900
And as adults, we formulate a plan.

1007
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:25,371
This is what l need
in order to be happy,

1008
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:29,900
or this is what l will struggle
and sacrifice and bleed for.

1009
01:27:30,145 --> 01:27:33,342
But what we really need
to do is stop struggling

1010
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:36,680
and recognize that there
is a greater plan for us all.

1011
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:41,355
- ls it really that easy?
- lt's so clear to me, Jerri.

1012
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:44,290
What we've been searching
for is right there,

1013
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:48,762
staring us in the face.
We just have to reach out and grab it.

1014
01:27:52,033 --> 01:27:53,500
Hello.

1015
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:56,332
Dr. Bill Stiffle?

1016
01:27:57,572 --> 01:28:02,009
ln my home?
ls this really possible?

1017
01:28:02,076 --> 01:28:04,271
Yes, yes.

1018
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:06,540
l see that you are
familiar with my work.

1019
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:08,241
l just want you to know

1020
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:11,581
that none of this would have
been possible without you.

1021
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:52,993
Whoa! What the hell's
going on here?

1022
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:55,427
lf they find him,
they know we kidnapped him!

1023
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:58,295
lf they know we kidnapped him,
our lives are ruined.

1024
01:28:58,366 --> 01:29:01,494
- We go to prison.
- What do you want to do?

1025
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:04,436
- l'm gonna kill him?
- Yeah.

1026
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:07,566
l'm gonna fucking kill you!

1027
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:08,631
Get him, Lee!

1028
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:11,472
Kill him!

1029
01:29:49,951 --> 01:29:52,044
Yeah, motherfucker!

1030
01:29:57,058 --> 01:30:00,391
- He won't die!
- You are such a pussy.

1031
01:30:00,461 --> 01:30:02,986
He's stronger than he looks.

1032
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:04,326
You do it, then.

1033
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,526
No fucking way, Lee.

1034
01:30:09,804 --> 01:30:10,896
Here.

1035
01:30:17,478 --> 01:30:18,775
Take it.

1036
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:29,055
What if he tries to grab
the knife away from me?

1037
01:30:29,123 --> 01:30:31,421
- Just fucking stab him quick.
- Like where?

1038
01:30:31,492 --> 01:30:35,189
- Stab him in the fucking stomach.
- He's gonna bleed all over the floor.

1039
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:37,731
- Who fucking cares! Do it!
- Shut up!

1040
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:39,733
Come on, you little pussy. Do it!

1041
01:30:39,801 --> 01:30:42,463
- Don't push me.
- Stab him. Fucking kill him!

1042
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:48,499
- Oh, shit!
- You stabbed me in the stomach!

1043
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:50,567
l did it. l did it, Billy.

1044
01:30:50,645 --> 01:30:53,205
- ls it deep?
- ls it deep, Charlie?

1045
01:30:54,415 --> 01:30:55,507
Fuck you!

1046
01:30:56,517 --> 01:30:59,008
- lt isn't deep.
- Well, fucking pardon me!

1047
01:30:59,087 --> 01:31:01,851
Do it again!
Come on, man! Do it!

1048
01:31:14,869 --> 01:31:17,895
- Do it again, Lee. Do it, man!
- Shut up!

1049
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:19,769
Get him! Do it!

1050
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:24,308
Holy shit!

1051
01:31:24,379 --> 01:31:27,143
- Let go of the knife.
- Fucking stab him again!

1052
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:29,342
- Let go!
- Stab him!

1053
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:31,851
- Fucking kill him.
- What are you doing!

1054
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:43,923
My eye!

1055
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:46,159
Oh, shit!

1056
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:48,566
Help!

1057
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:54,107
Help me!

1058
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:56,671
Gonna kill you!

1059
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:00,970
Gonna fucking kill you!

1060
01:32:01,049 --> 01:32:03,176
Wait. Charlie, hold on.

1061
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:06,482
Yeah, it's not my fault.
lt's not like l wanted to do this.

1062
01:32:06,554 --> 01:32:08,920
Charlie, it's over.

1063
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:11,254
- Get out of the way.
- Give me the knife.

1064
01:32:11,325 --> 01:32:13,589
Get the hell out of the way.

1065
01:32:14,762 --> 01:32:16,787
Don't ignore me, Charlie.

1066
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:21,433
l want to help you.

1067
01:32:21,502 --> 01:32:26,064
Does it look like l need
your fucking help?

1068
01:32:54,535 --> 01:32:56,867
My eye!

1069
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:07,844
Help!

1070
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:10,509
Somebody help me!

1071
01:33:11,486 --> 01:33:13,716
l can't see!

1072
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:28,196
Somebody help me!

1073
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:31,664
Somebody help me!

1074
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:35,242
l'm blind!

1075
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:42,948
Help me!

1076
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:54,954
Somebody help me!

1077
01:34:27,361 --> 01:34:30,797
Twin engine P-38 Lightning.

1078
01:34:43,945 --> 01:34:45,913
My God! Where the hell
have you been?

1079
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:48,471
- What happened to you?
- l was kidnapped, Dad.

1080
01:34:48,549 --> 01:34:51,518
Oh, my God, you're bleeding!
Are you OK?

1081
01:34:51,586 --> 01:34:54,111
No, he's not OK.
He just told me he was kidnapped.

1082
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:57,089
- You didn't even know.
- Don't try to blame this on me.

1083
01:34:57,158 --> 01:34:59,956
- Michael.
- What kind of father are you?

1084
01:35:00,027 --> 01:35:04,464
- l'm a good father.
- l'm a good mother. That's right.

1085
01:35:57,885 --> 01:36:00,046
lt's my fault.

1086
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:04,281
l know it is.

1087
01:36:08,262 --> 01:36:10,526
l didn't even know him.

1088
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,434
l didn't know my own son.

1089
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:27,714
Troy wanted to play guitar
in a rock band.

1090
01:36:29,984 --> 01:36:31,975
Be famous.

1091
01:36:33,521 --> 01:36:36,285
But he knew he wasn't any good.

1092
01:36:36,357 --> 01:36:39,087
And he felt stupid
for wishing that.

1093
01:36:41,128 --> 01:36:44,620
He had a crush on this girl
since he was 13

1094
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:48,896
that he never talked to.

1095
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:52,295
But he probably
wished he would've.

1096
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:57,467
He liked you.

1097
01:36:59,981 --> 01:37:02,472
But he felt sorry for you and

1098
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:08,119
he was afraid
that he'd be like his dad.

1099
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:15,989
He was really, really smart.

1100
01:37:16,063 --> 01:37:20,830
But he kept all
his ideas to himself,

1101
01:37:22,403 --> 01:37:24,394
unless you asked.

1102
01:37:25,406 --> 01:37:30,434
And he took great pictures of people
without them even knowing.

1103
01:37:35,216 --> 01:37:38,242
l miss him, you know?

1104
01:37:41,756 --> 01:37:45,487
He was my friend.
He was my best friend.

1105
01:37:48,963 --> 01:37:51,022
And l hate myself,

1106
01:37:52,233 --> 01:37:55,600
that l didn't even know
he was about to do this.

1107
01:38:06,914 --> 01:38:09,280
Thank you.

1108
01:38:33,174 --> 01:38:35,267
Lee explained how it happened.

1109
01:38:35,342 --> 01:38:37,833
He tried to be as helpful as he could.

1110
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:41,006
Yes, ma'am. lt was Billy's idea.

1111
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:43,607
He said he'd kill me if l told anyone.

1112
01:38:48,956 --> 01:38:51,390
And so Billy learned not to be a bully.

1113
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:02,233
Dr. Stiffle's book tour
kept him away.

1114
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:07,597
Are there any questions?

1115
01:39:09,977 --> 01:39:11,239
Anything?

1116
01:39:13,147 --> 01:39:14,876
Anybody?

1117
01:39:15,116 --> 01:39:19,644
Mrs. Stiffle finally found a family
that truly appreciated her.

1118
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:24,521
We are a part
of the VeggiForce family.

1119
01:39:24,592 --> 01:39:27,117
All of us together,

1120
01:39:27,194 --> 01:39:31,358
working for an entirely
new life system!

1121
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:34,933
Terri got the worst of it.

1122
01:39:35,002 --> 01:39:38,494
l'm just asking you to have
the smallest amount of vision.

1123
01:39:38,572 --> 01:39:40,802
Her vision was never realized.

1124
01:39:40,875 --> 01:39:42,137
Please!

1125
01:39:42,209 --> 01:39:44,643
The mayor got out of politics for good.

1126
01:39:44,712 --> 01:39:48,045
Well, in terms
of the physical execution,

1127
01:39:48,115 --> 01:39:51,915
there's only one guiding principle
that l rely on,

1128
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:54,587
and that's balance.

1129
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:57,681
l mean, it's all about balance.

1130
01:39:57,758 --> 01:39:59,225
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

1131
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:05,856
And Charlie was sent
to live with his father.

1132
01:40:05,933 --> 01:40:08,401
Breathe! Come on,
get tough. Get tough.

1133
01:40:08,469 --> 01:40:11,734
Get tough. Those people
are gonna beat the crap out of you.

1134
01:40:11,805 --> 01:40:16,538
Punch, smack that guy with both hands,
right in the mouth.

1135
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:19,977
Come on, push!
Yeah. That's it, that's it.

1136
01:40:20,047 --> 01:40:23,574
Everyone says he's better off now.

1137
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:28,083
Dean and Crystal escaped.

1138
01:40:29,957 --> 01:40:32,619
Together.

1139
01:40:35,262 --> 01:40:37,025
And as for me...

1140
01:40:38,499 --> 01:40:41,935
l was dead...
but now l live again.

1141
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:47,964
So l will do what l have to,

1142
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:52,172
in this world of freaks
and sub-human creatures.

1143
01:40:52,246 --> 01:40:55,875
And this time,
l will not be ignored.

1144
01:40:56,951 --> 01:40:59,784
l am...

1145
01:40:59,853 --> 01:41:03,084
the chumscrubber.

1146
01:41:04,084 --> 01:41:14,084
