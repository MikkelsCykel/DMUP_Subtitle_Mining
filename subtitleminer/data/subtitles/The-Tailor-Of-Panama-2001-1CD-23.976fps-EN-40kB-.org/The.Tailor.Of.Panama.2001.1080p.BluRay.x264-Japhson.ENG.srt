1
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:37,645
Panama.

2
00:00:39,154 --> 00:00:40,382
Panama?

3
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:41,886
Best I could do, Andrew...

4
00:00:42,124 --> 00:00:45,355
...in the circumstances,
given your sins.

5
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:47,590
They were baying for blood.

6
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:51,260
I argued your case.

7
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:55,769
"For his long service,
his fine brain in the balance...

8
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:57,563
...against the gambling debts...

9
00:00:57,774 --> 00:01:01,369
...the blown cover and the wives."

10
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:03,739
The wives.

11
00:01:04,514 --> 00:01:07,074
So, a last chance.

12
00:01:07,283 --> 00:01:08,341
Panama.

13
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:10,779
Keep the head down?

14
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:12,979
Serve out my time?

15
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:15,521
Not quite, Andrew.
We do have interests:

16
00:01:15,758 --> 00:01:19,353
The canal, vital artery.
There is work to be done.

17
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:24,932
But for God's sake,
be careful out there, man.

18
00:01:25,134 --> 00:01:27,659
There's a nasty web
of money-laundering...

19
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,895
...drug trafficking and corruption.

20
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:31,867
Really?

21
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,035
<i>There are only 200
resident Brits in Panama.</i>

22
00:01:37,046 --> 00:01:39,310
<i>But you can surely ferret
out one or two...</i>

23
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:43,282
<i>... who can gain you access
to the corridors of power.</i>

24
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:01,603
Look, look!
The Bridge of the Americas.

25
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:07,467
<i>You know, ever since
the canal cut them in half...</i>

26
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:09,976
<i>... this bridge is now the only link...</i>

27
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,081
<i>... between North and South America.</i>

28
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:15,748
<i>Think about it!</i>

29
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:49,977
<i>The way I see it,
we all have a dream of ourselves...</i>

30
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,985
...that we could be more than we are.

31
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:56,951
Well, Pendel and Braithwaite are here
to help you realize that dream...

32
00:02:57,193 --> 00:02:59,354
...in the Savile Row tradition.

33
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:02,257
Let's try this one now.

34
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:08,798
Oh, yeah, I guess this is kind of...

35
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,308
I thought you'd like that one, sir.
Mr. Connery's choice.

36
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,877
As soon as I saw you I thought,
"Who does he remind me of?"

37
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:21,484
And that's it. In the build too.
Golfer's shoulders.

38
00:04:56,582 --> 00:04:58,607
How about that, Uncle Benny?

39
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:02,481
<i>You've got the fluence, Harry.
I've always said it, and you have.</i>

40
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:05,782
<i>You're the outright best tailor
in the world. Bar none.</i>

41
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:08,983
<i>Steady on, Uncle Benny, steady on.</i>

42
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:15,262
Harry, come on.

43
00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:17,560
- I'm coming.
- All right.

44
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:21,440
All right, you get in first, Sarah.
Don't forget your belt.

45
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:22,835
- Sarah.
- I'm trying!

46
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:24,032
Mark.

47
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,076
Okay. Bye-bye.

48
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,301
George, George, I saw you yesterday.

49
00:05:56,744 --> 00:05:59,542
All right, here you go then.
How's your old lady?

50
00:06:10,992 --> 00:06:12,050
Sarah, Sarah!

51
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,625
Hi, Bella.

52
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,154
Dad, give me a quarter.

53
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:18,988
Have you learnt your poem?

54
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:22,532
<i>Tyger, tyger, burning bright
In the forest of the night</i>

55
00:06:39,388 --> 00:06:40,821
<i>- See you, Dad.
- Shalom.</i>

56
00:06:41,023 --> 00:06:42,251
<i>Shalom.</i>

57
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,102
Look at your hair!

58
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:06,211
<i>Oh, what immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful cemetery</i>

59
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:08,677
No, "symmetry." Symmetry.

60
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:11,407
I still don't know what it means.

61
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:18,088
- Did you see the news last night?
- Yes, I did.

62
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,487
Your people want their canal back.

63
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:24,153
Not my people, Ernesto.
They're rabid, right-wing senators.

64
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:26,299
- Do you know what they are?
- Say it.

65
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,967
Assholes.

66
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:53,487
You see?

67
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:55,127
Turn around.

68
00:07:57,064 --> 00:07:58,588
It's only a tad, Ramon.

69
00:07:58,966 --> 00:08:02,733
If you want to look good in my suit,
lose weight and grow a foot.

70
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:05,463
Come to the shop.
We can ease it a little.

71
00:08:05,674 --> 00:08:06,902
Okay.

72
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:11,670
So, what are we gonna do
about the overdraft, Harry?

73
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:13,678
You tell me, Ramon.

74
00:08:13,882 --> 00:08:16,976
You have to think
about selling the farm, Harry.

75
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:18,550
Sell it?

76
00:08:19,187 --> 00:08:20,950
It's a gold mine, Ramon.

77
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:25,525
<i>Angelo's turning it around. He's a
very good man, Ramon. Dedicated.</i>

78
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:27,824
I hear you got a water problem.

79
00:08:28,363 --> 00:08:30,729
<i>Did have, Ramon, did have.
I put that right.</i>

80
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:32,797
<i>Now, it flows like...</i>

81
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:34,332
Water.

82
00:08:34,803 --> 00:08:35,895
Exactly, Ramon.

83
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:39,701
Maybe you shouldn't have
bought it, eh?

84
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:43,072
On your advice, Ramon. Fair's fair.

85
00:08:44,647 --> 00:08:47,081
The bank wishes to see
a substantial reduction...

86
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:51,083
...on the outstanding sum
by the end of next month.

87
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:52,811
Otherwise...

88
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:55,221
...we have to call it in.

89
00:08:55,425 --> 00:08:56,414
What?

90
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:57,820
The whole lot?

91
00:08:58,027 --> 00:09:00,086
But of course the whole lot.

92
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:06,634
You are my friend. I hate
to do this, but my hands are tied.

93
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:07,894
What can I say?

94
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:12,630
What am I going to tell Louisa?
I bought it with her inheritance.

95
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,776
Well, you're the storyteller, Harry.

96
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,620
You're an angel.

97
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:41,361
Someone to see you.

98
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:42,572
Oh, yes? Who?

99
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:44,637
New customer, he say.

100
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:47,809
Hi. Name's Osnard.

101
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:50,504
I phoned.

102
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:53,279
Mr. Osnard. Harry Pendel.

103
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:55,748
Very happy to meet you, sir.

104
00:09:56,553 --> 00:09:59,454
No offense, but I was hoping
to see Mr. Braithwaite.

105
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:02,491
No chance of that,
I'm sorry to say, sir.

106
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:05,924
My late partner has been dead
and gone these many years.

107
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,726
Though his exacting standards
are very much alive and well.

108
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:11,526
Glad to hear that.

109
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:14,968
He dressed my father, you know.

110
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:17,107
Back in his Savile Row days.

111
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,976
Well, I never! Now that's a first,
I don't mind admitting.

112
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:23,739
Father to son,
Savile Row to Panama City.

113
00:10:23,948 --> 00:10:26,712
- Did you hear that?
- I thought you'd be surprised.

114
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,647
Surprised, sir, and delighted.

115
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:31,583
Marta, put Mr. Osnard down
as an old customer.

116
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:34,724
Arthur Braithwaite made
for his father.

117
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,656
Now, if you'd care
to come this way, Mr. Osnard.

118
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,826
What in hell happened to her?

119
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:45,496
In the bad old days, would that be?
Noriega's time?

120
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:47,329
Rough justice meted out?

121
00:10:48,573 --> 00:10:51,168
- If you'd care to take a seat, sir.
- Thank you.

122
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:56,747
We call this The Club Room. Many of
our gentlemen spend time here...

123
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,008
...in the lunch hour
and at the day's end.

124
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:00,446
And why not?

125
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:02,951
What did you have in mind,
sir, exactly?

126
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:06,591
I thought I'd start with a few
lounge suits. See how they go.

127
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:11,489
After that, well, the "full monty,"
as old Braithwaite used to say.

128
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:13,458
I see. Very good, sir.

129
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:17,600
Pity the expression's been hijacked.
Means quite the other thing now.

130
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:20,599
- So they tell me, sir.
- Bollock naked, in fact.

131
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:22,738
- Quite so, sir.
- Money's no problem.

132
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:26,608
Take a look at these, sir.
See what takes your fancy.

133
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,375
They're all the right weight
for this diabolical climate.

134
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:33,517
Seven ounces of nicely breathing,
finest worsted.

135
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:36,152
About all a man could
or should put up with.

136
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:39,255
How about this one?
Alpaca, am I right?

137
00:11:39,457 --> 00:11:41,118
- Very good, sir.
- Perfect.

138
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,317
And exactly what I should've picked.

139
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:45,223
Given that money's no object?

140
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:50,990
- So, what's next?
- Ah! The sun!

141
00:11:51,202 --> 00:11:53,261
Vital statistics.
Please step this way.

142
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,869
Certainly.

143
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:58,472
If I could ask you to slip off
your jacket. Thank you, sir.

144
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:14,688
You were Noriega's tailor,
weren't you, in his time?

145
00:12:15,227 --> 00:12:17,354
I'm sorry, sir, is that a problem?

146
00:12:17,563 --> 00:12:21,397
Not necessarily.
Smelly little bugger, was he?

147
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:23,868
If I may, sir.

148
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:26,765
Forty.

149
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:28,564
And the waist...

150
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:30,240
What's the damage?

151
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:32,706
A very creditable 34-plus.

152
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,012
Plus what?

153
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,311
Plus lunch, put it that way, sir.

154
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,947
Very good.

155
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:42,746
Do you ever miss it?
The old country? Savile Row?

156
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:46,389
The Row. Well, now...

157
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:48,116
...I do and I don't.

158
00:12:48,927 --> 00:12:51,327
Nothing beats it,
but when I was there...

159
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,193
...I always felt very much
in old Arthur Braithwaite's shadow.

160
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:59,799
Though it was Arthur Braithwaite
who encouraged me to spread my wings.

161
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,908
- Good old boy, Arthur, was he?
- One of the old school, sir.

162
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:08,838
Now, if I might...

163
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:11,748
Very good, sir.

164
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:13,918
Do we dress right or left?

165
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,783
Most gentlemen favor left these days.
Don't think it's political.

166
00:13:17,991 --> 00:13:21,984
Never know where the bloody thing is.
Bobs about like a windsock.

167
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:24,664
- You were saying?
- Saying, sir?

168
00:13:24,864 --> 00:13:28,766
Braithwaite. Telling you
to spread your wings.

169
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:32,194
Yes, of course.
I remember it like yesterday.

170
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:36,034
I was cutting a nice muted check
hacking jacket for Lord Braeburn.

171
00:13:36,276 --> 00:13:38,836
Finest mohair, dash of cashmere.

172
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,306
I looked up and he was looking
at me from the doorway.

173
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,447
Arthur Braithwaite, that is.

174
00:13:44,652 --> 00:13:47,212
He was a big man, imposing.

175
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:50,151
He had a presence.
It's hard to put it into words.

176
00:13:50,358 --> 00:13:52,155
- It was the moustache.
- Moustache?

177
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,692
Bloody great bushy job,
soup all over it.

178
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:58,992
- There was no moustache in my day.
- I can see it now. Bright brown.

179
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,601
I think we're being rumbled, Harry.
Admit nothing. Deny all.

180
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:04,794
I think your memory's playing tricks.

181
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:09,203
You're thinking of another man and
awarding his moustache to Braithwaite.

182
00:14:10,878 --> 00:14:12,243
Go on.

183
00:14:12,446 --> 00:14:16,576
"Harry," he says to me,
"I think you've earned your spurs.

184
00:14:16,784 --> 00:14:18,945
How would you feel
about taking my name...

185
00:14:19,153 --> 00:14:21,622
...and tradition to the New World?

186
00:14:21,823 --> 00:14:24,189
I'm talking about a full partnership."

187
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:27,226
I don't mind saying,
there were tears in my eyes.

188
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:29,727
You've practically got tears in mine.

189
00:14:30,232 --> 00:14:31,324
Thank you, sir.

190
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,433
I've never heard such a load
of bullshit in my life.

191
00:14:38,073 --> 00:14:39,802
Come and sit down, Harry.

192
00:14:40,175 --> 00:14:41,335
It's all right.

193
00:14:41,643 --> 00:14:43,838
I'm your fairy godmother.

194
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,971
The thing is, Harry,
I know who you are.

195
00:14:48,483 --> 00:14:51,452
More accurately,
I know who you aren't.

196
00:14:51,653 --> 00:14:54,850
- I don't know what you're saying.
- It's all right. Relax.

197
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:58,583
Because I know. You're 906017 Pendel.

198
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:01,194
Six years for arson,
served two and a half.

199
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:05,356
Learnt your tailoring in the slammer.
Insurance scam, wasn't it?

200
00:15:05,568 --> 00:15:08,002
Set fire to a warehouse
for your Uncle Benny.

201
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:10,695
They caught you
with the matches in your hand.

202
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,737
You've never been near Savile Row.

203
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:14,772
Braithwaite is your Uncle Benny...

204
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:18,572
...raised from the dead, born again
and given a size-nine halo.

205
00:15:22,485 --> 00:15:26,317
Upon release, you did a runner to
Panama with your Uncle Benny's help.

206
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,385
Built up a fine business.

207
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:32,616
Married the daughter of an American
canal engineer. Well-respected man.

208
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,561
But you owe the bank 50,000,
thanks to that farm.

209
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:39,255
You've put in the shop
and the house as collateral.

210
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:42,027
Not wise, Harry. Not wise at all.

211
00:15:43,037 --> 00:15:45,801
I can almost hear the creditors
banging on the door.

212
00:15:46,173 --> 00:15:47,266
Who are you?

213
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:49,234
I'm Andy Osnard.

214
00:15:49,478 --> 00:15:52,743
New boy at the British Embassy,
finding my way around town.

215
00:16:00,956 --> 00:16:02,890
Strictly between us...

216
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:05,649
...I'm MI.6's man in Panama.

217
00:16:06,027 --> 00:16:09,087
It's dark and lonely work,
like oral sex.

218
00:16:09,297 --> 00:16:11,288
But someone has to do it, Harry.

219
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm opening up a little network.
Keeping an eye on the canal.

220
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:18,668
So, what's that got to do with me?

221
00:16:18,907 --> 00:16:20,966
What gives you
the right to come here...

222
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:24,838
...sandbag me with my past
after I've paid my debt to society?

223
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:27,811
Cool down. I'm bonus.

224
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,147
Okay.

225
00:16:31,454 --> 00:16:32,443
What do you want?

226
00:16:33,556 --> 00:16:34,887
Your memory.

227
00:16:35,157 --> 00:16:36,556
Your "rock of eye."

228
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:40,752
Isn't that the expression? Things you
know and don't even know you know.

229
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:43,022
Highest prices paid.

230
00:16:46,202 --> 00:16:47,829
Get out. Now.

231
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:49,398
Off.

232
00:16:49,705 --> 00:16:52,970
Don't be a cunt, Harry.
We're made for each other.

233
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:56,303
You have debts, I have money.
Where's your patriotism?

234
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,309
I had it out in prison,
without an anesthetic.

235
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:09,722
There's five grand there.
Say it's on account of the suits.

236
00:17:09,926 --> 00:17:14,125
Call it "entertainment expenses,"
anything you like, really.

237
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:16,458
I want us to get on, Harry.

238
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,058
Go on.

239
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:23,763
Show me around, is all.

240
00:17:26,076 --> 00:17:27,202
Do I have a choice?

241
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:29,469
Oh, don't put it like that.

242
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,207
It's a game. Let's have some fun, eh?

243
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:40,381
Hi.

244
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:42,989
No, nothing much.

245
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:46,995
Well, sure, if you feel you have to.

246
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:51,625
- Why not just bring him home?
- I think I'll take him to the club.

247
00:17:52,603 --> 00:17:54,902
Not sure. He's an odd chap.

248
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:57,372
No, nothing's wrong.

249
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,677
Your voice sounds funny.

250
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:06,779
He called it a windsock?

251
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:21,160
Se? Or. Good evening, Mr. Pendel.

252
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,858
- Must have cost a lot to get in here.
- Had to be done.

253
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,130
Hey, Harry, what about my blazer?

254
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:33,173
Drop by on Tuesday, Luis.
It'll be ready to try on.

255
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,345
Blazers, they all want blazers.

256
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,175
You dress everyone here?

257
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:39,681
Just about, Andy.

258
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,409
So who are "they"?

259
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,281
Who gets to join?

260
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:47,084
Basically, 30 ruling families,
their lawyers and their bankers.

261
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,317
And their tailors, I take it.

262
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,859
When the Americans took out
Noriega, I said to myself:

263
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,899
"Harry, they got Ali Baba,
but they missed the 40 thieves."

264
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,598
Well, here they are.

265
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,704
So fill me in.

266
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,670
Nobody ever loses
their reputation in Panama.

267
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,140
They hang it in the closet
for a bit to get its shape back.

268
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,314
When they put it on again,
it's as good as new.

269
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,218
On the dance floor, Rafi Domingo.

270
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,080
Shipping and drugs.

271
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,217
I could fuck that very easily.

272
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,822
- Wouldn't be any pain at all.
- A lot have, Andy.

273
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,023
A lot wish they had, who haven't...

274
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:31,601
...and one or two have,
who wish they hadn't.

275
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,640
Who are those charmers just come in?

276
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:41,009
Government ministers
and the money boys who own them.

277
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,080
At the table, bunch of gentlemen
from the loyal opposition.

278
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:47,649
They come much cheaper, naturally.

279
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:56,257
Welcome to Panama.

280
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,825
A Casablanca without heroes.

281
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:01,828
You are pure gold, Harry.

282
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,361
Hey!

283
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,003
Harry!

284
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,399
Mickie.

285
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:12,744
Harry.

286
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:16,209
Mickie, I think you're
a touch refreshed!

287
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,948
Please, come and sit down.

288
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,617
"A man should stand on his feet."

289
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,210
Anyone remember that?!

290
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,485
Isn't that the next bit?

291
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:32,396
"Never on our knees." Right.
Or on our asses.

292
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:36,728
- So who the fuck are you, my friend?
- I'd like you to meet Andy Osnard.

293
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,368
British Embassy.

294
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,868
Mickie really is a genuine hero, Andy.

295
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,237
One of the few with the guts
to stand up to you-know-who.

296
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:47,002
Mickie, please sit down.
People are staring.

297
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,977
I don't give a fuck about these fucks.

298
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:53,914
These are the fucks who kept
that fuck Noriega in power.

299
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,611
You know what I would do...
Mr. Andy, right?

300
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:59,314
You know what I would do
if I was president?

301
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,791
- What?
- I'd kill every fuck in this room.

302
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,293
All of us.

303
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:07,159
Look at us. Look at us!

304
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,670
We got everything
God needed to make paradise.

305
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:13,930
And what do we do?

306
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,199
We sell each other.

307
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:19,003
We sell our country.
We sell it all away!

308
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:21,145
Harry, you take him for a walk.

309
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:23,212
Look at these people, eh!

310
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,115
Look at these people.

311
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:28,913
You sold your souls,
you don't even know it. Stupid!

312
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:34,325
If you make any more trouble,
I will never cut you another suit.

313
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:39,432
Come on. I'll take you home.

314
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:42,665
Sorry. He's an old friend,
you know.

315
00:21:45,406 --> 00:21:46,703
Hello, Harry.

316
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:48,805
<i>Se? Or Delgado. Buenos noches.</i>

317
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:51,477
Canal Commissioner?
He as clean as they say?

318
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:53,577
Well, my wife thinks so.

319
00:21:54,315 --> 00:21:56,283
Come on, Mickie, what is this?

320
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:12,526
Come on, Mickie.

321
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:15,890
You're a good man, Harry.

322
00:23:16,098 --> 00:23:20,034
The only good men left in Panama City
are you and me.

323
00:23:20,236 --> 00:23:23,501
- That's all. You and me.
- Okay, in you go. Come on.

324
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:29,300
He has heart, Mr. Cool.

325
00:23:29,512 --> 00:23:30,501
Heart.

326
00:23:30,746 --> 00:23:32,977
Come on, now. Call it a night.

327
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:48,992
So, what's the story with him?

328
00:23:49,766 --> 00:23:50,960
Mickie?

329
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:54,666
He was my first customer.

330
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:56,427
Best-looking man in Panama.

331
00:23:57,706 --> 00:23:58,764
A god.

332
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:02,472
Till Noriega threw him
into prison to shut him up.

333
00:24:02,944 --> 00:24:04,741
Didn't bloody well work, did it?

334
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:09,876
There's more to Mickie Abraxas
than meets the eye.

335
00:24:10,385 --> 00:24:12,285
Oh, I'm sure there is.

336
00:24:13,254 --> 00:24:16,156
My people don't care
about the glorious past exploits...

337
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:18,452
...of some shagged-out old wino.

338
00:24:18,661 --> 00:24:21,858
They want the real stuff.
Today's men.

339
00:24:22,465 --> 00:24:24,160
Tomorrow's, not yesterday's.

340
00:24:25,434 --> 00:24:27,868
We're not a fucking charity
for losers.

341
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,970
I hope I haven't made
a mistake with you.

342
00:24:41,183 --> 00:24:43,777
Don't underestimate Mickie Abraxas.

343
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,487
So?

344
00:24:45,688 --> 00:24:48,213
What if I was to tell you
he's still at it?

345
00:24:49,358 --> 00:24:51,121
At what, exactly?

346
00:24:51,494 --> 00:24:53,121
He's still in there.

347
00:24:53,763 --> 00:24:55,321
The Silent Opposition.

348
00:24:55,664 --> 00:24:57,895
The "Silent Opposition"?

349
00:24:58,101 --> 00:25:01,161
He's never lost touch
with ordinary, decent people.

350
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:02,963
Deprived people.

351
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:07,043
People who are tired
of the corruption, the greed.

352
00:25:07,577 --> 00:25:09,738
Do you know what the poor call those?

353
00:25:12,482 --> 00:25:14,006
"The Cocaine Towers."

354
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:16,116
And our 85 banks?

355
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,843
"The launderettes."

356
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:19,847
Can we buy him?

357
00:25:20,057 --> 00:25:22,082
Mickie? Never.

358
00:25:23,794 --> 00:25:27,161
But he might allow you
to contribute to the cause.

359
00:25:35,238 --> 00:25:39,403
Uncle Benny, I fill up. I can't stop.
I get the wind in my ears.

360
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,636
You've got the fluence in full flow
and the rock of eye.

361
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:46,408
But it's a curse
as well as a blessing.

362
00:26:03,234 --> 00:26:04,758
How'd it go?

363
00:26:09,474 --> 00:26:11,908
Fine. I think.

364
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,338
Hey...

365
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:16,203
...get in here.

366
00:26:27,326 --> 00:26:28,554
Hi.

367
00:26:29,561 --> 00:26:30,892
I missed you.

368
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,731
Wait, I'll take my socks off.

369
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:38,000
I may be some time.

370
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:16,632
Mr. Osnard.

371
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,071
Ah, Andrew Osnard.

372
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,715
Nigel Stormont. Francesca Deane.

373
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:24,577
- Hello.
- Welcome to Panama.

374
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:26,307
Thank you, ambassador.

375
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:27,520
Please.

376
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,713
I gather you've been having
a look round already...

377
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:32,925
...quite extensively.

378
00:27:33,126 --> 00:27:35,117
Yes, indeed. Great spot.

379
00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:36,556
Right up my street.

380
00:27:36,763 --> 00:27:41,564
And how should we describe your
street, Andrew...

381
00:27:41,768 --> 00:27:43,395
...to the curious?

382
00:27:44,003 --> 00:27:46,404
I usually say
I'm in information technology.

383
00:27:46,607 --> 00:27:49,303
Oh, you're one of them.

384
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,670
"A friend."

385
00:27:51,078 --> 00:27:54,206
That's right. I'm a friend.

386
00:27:55,082 --> 00:27:58,074
Oh, my dear, but it's a huge secret.

387
00:27:58,285 --> 00:28:00,845
Or it was, until Osnard blubbed it.

388
00:28:01,088 --> 00:28:04,319
I mean, I'm barely allowed to know it.

389
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:07,287
Not the Osnard got
drummed out of Madrid?

390
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,117
Foreign minister's wife, wasn't it?

391
00:28:10,162 --> 00:28:13,359
Not his wife. Mistress.

392
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:15,829
There are some things
I won't do for England.

393
00:28:16,568 --> 00:28:19,002
Got your picture in the paper,
didn't it?

394
00:28:19,204 --> 00:28:21,729
Hence my posting to Panama.
What was your crime?

395
00:28:23,475 --> 00:28:24,442
Coffee?

396
00:28:24,643 --> 00:28:25,701
Thank you.

397
00:28:25,911 --> 00:28:27,435
Help yourself.

398
00:28:27,746 --> 00:28:30,978
Is it just exile, or do you
have a purpose here?

399
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,844
Sure.

400
00:28:34,721 --> 00:28:38,213
The boys at home are concerned that
the world's biggest trade gateway...

401
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:40,619
...doesn't fall into
the wrong hands...

402
00:28:43,496 --> 00:28:45,691
...now that it's in the wrong hands.

403
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:49,760
Forgive me.
Don't want to seem presumptuous...

404
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:52,494
...but I doubt you'll find
anything they don't know...

405
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:55,299
...from our regular embassy briefings.

406
00:28:58,578 --> 00:29:00,808
Know about the Silent Opposition?

407
00:29:05,018 --> 00:29:06,417
There you go.

408
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,887
You're a fast worker.

409
00:29:12,092 --> 00:29:15,289
See something worth having,
go after it.

410
00:29:15,496 --> 00:29:17,964
May I ask at what point we here
at the embassy...

411
00:29:18,165 --> 00:29:20,133
...will get sight of your product?

412
00:29:21,035 --> 00:29:24,004
My boss says no local sharing unless
he gives the nod...

413
00:29:24,204 --> 00:29:27,002
...but I'm not really bothered
about that.

414
00:29:27,741 --> 00:29:30,574
Say, the four of us in this room?

415
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:33,703
I'd have no problem with that.

416
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:38,979
Well, all that seems very
satisfactory. Nigel?

417
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,253
Francesca?

418
00:29:42,022 --> 00:29:43,512
Good to have you with us, Andrew.

419
00:29:43,957 --> 00:29:45,652
Good to be here.

420
00:29:46,093 --> 00:29:48,755
Francesca will show you
to your office.

421
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:50,823
Yes.

422
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:59,496
It's a bit on the poky side,
I'm afraid.

423
00:29:59,741 --> 00:30:02,141
Bit on the poky side's fine with me.

424
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:04,608
We thought you'd be out
and about a lot.

425
00:30:04,813 --> 00:30:06,178
Here we are.

426
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,355
What are you listening to?

427
00:30:24,132 --> 00:30:25,121
The sea.

428
00:30:31,473 --> 00:30:35,035
Bloody thing's been sitting in
the warehouse all its life.

429
00:30:36,512 --> 00:30:38,639
Stuck on one combo.

430
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:42,510
Tumblers all shot.

431
00:30:48,023 --> 00:30:49,320
Gotcha!

432
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:57,057
Are you quite sure that it
was locked in the first place?

433
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:05,766
I'm staying at the Gamboa Rain Forest
Resort till the apartment's ready.

434
00:31:05,975 --> 00:31:07,533
Come out on Sunday.

435
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:11,338
Spot of lunch. Swim in the lake.

436
00:31:13,182 --> 00:31:14,376
See how it goes.

437
00:31:16,185 --> 00:31:18,381
I think I'm busy on Sunday.

438
00:31:18,622 --> 00:31:20,089
You're right.

439
00:31:21,158 --> 00:31:22,591
It was open.

440
00:31:25,328 --> 00:31:27,228
Just tight from lack of use.

441
00:31:32,436 --> 00:31:34,631
The ambassador's asked me
to brief you...

442
00:31:34,838 --> 00:31:37,398
...in case there's anything you
don't already know.

443
00:31:44,214 --> 00:31:48,275
Noriega formed these so-called
"Dignity Battalions."

444
00:31:48,485 --> 00:31:50,043
Dingbats.

445
00:31:50,253 --> 00:31:55,281
They were to beat the dignity out of
anyone remotely critical of Noriega.

446
00:31:56,726 --> 00:31:59,787
It was Dr. Frankenstein,
George Bush...

447
00:31:59,997 --> 00:32:02,625
...who created this monster...

448
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:04,563
...when he was head of the CIA.

449
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:06,566
And when Noriega's...

450
00:32:06,771 --> 00:32:10,673
...drug running and brutality
got too much, even for the CIA...

451
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:15,710
...it was George, now President Bush,
who decided to take him out.

452
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:17,912
And just to make sure...

453
00:32:18,816 --> 00:32:21,840
...they fire-bombed a big chunk
of the old city.

454
00:32:24,687 --> 00:32:27,884
Sadly, that's where
the anti-Noriega rebels were.

455
00:32:28,123 --> 00:32:31,251
The handful that Noriega hadn't
banged up already.

456
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:36,425
So no more opposition,
silent or otherwise.

457
00:32:37,032 --> 00:32:38,260
Burnt...

458
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:40,660
...scattered...

459
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:43,738
...fled.

460
00:32:47,344 --> 00:32:50,211
Or risen again from the ashes.

461
00:33:02,459 --> 00:33:06,327
Okay, okay, okay.
Everybody, here we go.

462
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:16,404
Sorry.

463
00:33:31,722 --> 00:33:33,189
Mickie!

464
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,890
Come in.

465
00:33:50,207 --> 00:33:54,303
Sorry about the other night.
I'm going through a bad patch.

466
00:33:54,512 --> 00:33:58,278
Is it money, Mickie? Is it?
Maybe I can help.

467
00:34:00,585 --> 00:34:01,779
You?

468
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,780
You got worse debts than me.

469
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:09,419
Mr. Farmer, huh?

470
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:17,126
Do you still keep in touch,
you know...

471
00:34:17,336 --> 00:34:20,430
...with any of the students,
the fighters, from the old days?

472
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,235
No, they're all lawyers now. Bankers.

473
00:34:26,144 --> 00:34:29,341
Haven't you heard?
We got a democracy.

474
00:34:29,548 --> 00:34:32,142
There's still a lot to fight for,
Mickie.

475
00:34:33,585 --> 00:34:36,213
I haven't got the stomach for it.

476
00:34:36,421 --> 00:34:39,481
I get the shakes when I see a cop.

477
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:44,118
Unless I'm drunk,
and then I want to hit him.

478
00:34:44,563 --> 00:34:46,554
Either way...

479
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:49,259
What about Marta's people?

480
00:34:49,802 --> 00:34:51,429
They loved you.

481
00:34:51,971 --> 00:34:53,268
They looked up to you.

482
00:34:56,676 --> 00:34:58,940
You should give up on me, Harry.

483
00:35:00,013 --> 00:35:01,810
I'm a lost cause.

484
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:05,412
How much do you owe, Mickie?

485
00:35:05,618 --> 00:35:08,109
Owe to the casino? To you?

486
00:35:08,321 --> 00:35:10,755
All of it. All in. Come on.

487
00:35:13,092 --> 00:35:16,357
Not much change out of 20 grand.

488
00:35:17,163 --> 00:35:18,721
I'll get it for you, Mickie.

489
00:35:19,332 --> 00:35:22,130
And I'm gonna make you a new suit.

490
00:35:22,669 --> 00:35:25,695
A lovely silk and mohair herringbone.

491
00:35:27,273 --> 00:35:28,570
Okay?

492
00:35:28,775 --> 00:35:31,438
Okay. Okay.

493
00:35:43,123 --> 00:35:45,148
- Se? Or Pendel?
- What have I done wrong, Marta?

494
00:35:45,392 --> 00:35:48,259
Nothing. That's the problem.
Look at these accounts.

495
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:51,022
Your friend Rafi Domingo.
Two months overdue.

496
00:35:51,265 --> 00:35:53,733
Carry it till next month.
He's a good customer.

497
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:57,027
He's a shit. He made all his
money under Noriega.

498
00:35:57,237 --> 00:35:58,704
I'm going to charge him interest.

499
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,806
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can.

500
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:03,909
You're worried they won't like you
if you make them pay.

501
00:36:04,111 --> 00:36:05,271
It's a tradition.

502
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:07,777
Gentlemen keep tailors
waiting for money.

503
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:10,973
Gentlemen? Find me one.

504
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:14,911
Your Mr. Osnard isn't one,
that's for sure.

505
00:36:15,123 --> 00:36:17,353
- What does he want?
- A suit.

506
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:19,153
This is me, Harry.

507
00:36:19,994 --> 00:36:22,189
He's looking for information.

508
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,763
Be nice to him. No sulks.
Promise?

509
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:27,496
He's a devil.

510
00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:29,260
- Who says?
- His eyes say.

511
00:36:29,471 --> 00:36:31,530
I'm just having a bit
of a natter with him.

512
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,605
Don't look at me like that, Marta.
I'm just a tailor.

513
00:36:34,807 --> 00:36:39,005
No, Harry, not just a tailor.
You are a dreamer.

514
00:36:39,212 --> 00:36:41,976
Which is why I have to
watch over you.

515
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:46,078
Oh, speak of the devil. Mr. Osnard!

516
00:36:46,285 --> 00:36:47,946
How's my suit coming along then?

517
00:36:48,154 --> 00:36:50,486
When I put the shears
into that alpaca, I said:

518
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:53,420
"Harry, this is gonna be
something special."

519
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:56,694
A poem, is it?

520
00:36:56,897 --> 00:36:59,058
Great body.

521
00:36:59,433 --> 00:37:02,732
As long as her face is turned away
when you're fucking her.

522
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:06,435
Marta's decent. She's been
in some very bad places.

523
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,505
Oh, yeah? Such as?

524
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:11,541
Here. Under Noriega.

525
00:37:15,749 --> 00:37:19,048
She stood up when the rest
of us were lying down.

526
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:21,050
That's why they did her face for her.

527
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:24,156
Are her sacred causes still intact?

528
00:37:24,758 --> 00:37:26,783
She'd never budge.

529
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:28,358
Not Marta.

530
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:30,189
So she's one of them.

531
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,797
- One of who?
- The Silent Opposition.

532
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,161
Absolutely.

533
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:37,735
- Harry, stop.
- I can't.

534
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:39,406
What is she?

535
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:43,273
Their chief of ops?

536
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:44,971
Head spook?

537
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,377
- She's more. Much more.
- How much?

538
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:50,949
You press me too hard, Andy.

539
00:37:51,886 --> 00:37:56,050
Sweetheart, you haven't even
felt me yet.

540
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,282
Think "farm."

541
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:03,088
She's their Joan of Arc.
Their spiritual leader, bar none.

542
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:06,456
You're too much, Harry.

543
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,499
Can I have her?

544
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:12,997
Every penny you give her goes
to the cause...

545
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,642
...without commission
or deduction of any kind.

546
00:38:15,844 --> 00:38:16,833
How much?

547
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,411
For the pulse and soul
of the Silent Opposition?

548
00:38:19,614 --> 00:38:21,310
For Marta?

549
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:23,985
Mickie needs 20 grand
to activate his units.

550
00:38:24,186 --> 00:38:26,211
Marta should get the same.

551
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:29,456
- Yeah, I think we can swing that.
- Thank you, Mr. Osnard.

552
00:38:29,658 --> 00:38:33,321
London's tickled pink with this
Silent Opposition of yours.

553
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:39,334
How is the farm, by the way?

554
00:38:39,535 --> 00:38:41,469
- Don't ask.
- Know who your neighbor is?

555
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,900
The guy who's cutting off access
to your water?

556
00:38:44,106 --> 00:38:46,540
He's not a person,
he's an absentee landlord...

557
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:49,176
...and a corporation in Miami.
And a prick.

558
00:38:51,146 --> 00:38:52,477
You know where he banks?

559
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:55,709
With your chum Ramon.

560
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:59,646
Not to put too fine a point on it,
he is your chum Ramon.

561
00:38:59,855 --> 00:39:01,823
Well, Ramon owns two thirds.

562
00:39:04,227 --> 00:39:06,422
Mr. X owns the other third.

563
00:39:07,063 --> 00:39:08,428
You know who Mr. X is?

564
00:39:09,332 --> 00:39:11,197
No, I don't know who Mr. X is.

565
00:39:11,868 --> 00:39:14,496
How about your farm-manager chap?

566
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:16,238
Angelo, isn't it?

567
00:39:44,734 --> 00:39:45,793
<i>No!</i>

568
00:39:47,438 --> 00:39:49,167
<i>Mickie! Marta!</i>

569
00:39:49,373 --> 00:39:51,364
<i>Oh, for the love of God!</i>

570
00:39:57,615 --> 00:39:58,912
<i>Mickie!</i>

571
00:40:00,184 --> 00:40:02,880
- Oh, God!
- It's okay.

572
00:40:04,922 --> 00:40:06,514
What time is it?

573
00:40:06,757 --> 00:40:08,418
It's 7:00.

574
00:40:12,797 --> 00:40:15,061
I'll make breakfast.

575
00:40:27,144 --> 00:40:29,477
What happened to your diet, Mom?

576
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:30,773
I'm in denial.

577
00:40:30,983 --> 00:40:32,177
What's denial?

578
00:40:32,384 --> 00:40:34,215
A very big river in Africa.

579
00:40:34,419 --> 00:40:36,353
- Ba-bum!
- Thank you.

580
00:40:36,755 --> 00:40:40,885
Mom, this girl in school told me
mothers who work...

581
00:40:41,093 --> 00:40:44,756
...feel guilty about their children.
Why don't you?

582
00:40:44,997 --> 00:40:47,557
Maybe because your father
is such a good mother.

583
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:50,891
Listen, it's ballet today.
Do not forget your bag.

584
00:40:51,134 --> 00:40:52,931
- Let's go.
- Okay, come on.

585
00:40:57,974 --> 00:40:59,601
Are you seeing
the president today, Dad?

586
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:02,243
Indeed. So we'd
better get our skates on.

587
00:41:10,688 --> 00:41:12,656
Harold Pendel.

588
00:41:27,104 --> 00:41:29,231
This way, Mr. Pendel.

589
00:41:32,043 --> 00:41:36,912
Working. Always working.
He thinks only of Panama.

590
00:41:44,822 --> 00:41:46,414
Se? Or Pendel.

591
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:48,224
Show me your pass, please.

592
00:41:48,426 --> 00:41:50,326
Marco, you know me.

593
00:41:50,528 --> 00:41:52,861
I made you that
double-breasted mohair.

594
00:41:53,098 --> 00:41:55,566
I'm still waiting for you
to pay me for it.

595
00:41:55,801 --> 00:41:59,862
Through here. He's gonna give you
only five minutes, okay?

596
00:42:06,278 --> 00:42:09,611
Your Excellency.
Welcome back, indeed.

597
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:13,384
Five capitals in one week,
I think I read.

598
00:42:13,952 --> 00:42:19,083
Paris to Tokyo in seven days.
A record for a world-class statesman.

599
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:20,622
Pants.

600
00:42:23,328 --> 00:42:25,956
They'll know where Panama is then,
won't they?

601
00:42:26,665 --> 00:42:30,863
We won't be just a wriggly little
worm on the map with a canal, will we?

602
00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:32,536
Vest.

603
00:42:36,242 --> 00:42:38,802
I dispense with
the rear buckle as a rule...

604
00:42:39,011 --> 00:42:41,479
...with your handmade waistcoat,
Excellency.

605
00:42:41,681 --> 00:42:45,276
Too many of my gentlemen report
a discomfort to the lower vertebrae...

606
00:42:45,485 --> 00:42:48,545
...when leaning backward, relishing
a postprandial cigar.

607
00:42:48,754 --> 00:42:49,584
Jacket.

608
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,950
Did we discuss the canal's future
on our travels...

609
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,252
...if I may be so bold?

610
00:42:59,632 --> 00:43:03,534
So you want to know something
about the canal?

611
00:43:03,769 --> 00:43:05,100
If it pleases Your Excellency.

612
00:43:05,304 --> 00:43:07,397
You're halfway up it.

613
00:43:07,607 --> 00:43:09,336
I stand upright.

614
00:43:10,443 --> 00:43:13,037
Okay, just.

615
00:43:13,246 --> 00:43:15,214
I bend down...

616
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:18,810
...my balls are in my ears.
- Very good, sir.

617
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:21,749
You make your pants too tight,
Mr. Braithwaite.

618
00:43:34,368 --> 00:43:35,835
Harry!

619
00:43:39,673 --> 00:43:41,664
I've got a job.

620
00:43:42,609 --> 00:43:44,440
Shit, shit, shit!

621
00:43:49,249 --> 00:43:50,648
It's upstairs.

622
00:43:51,919 --> 00:43:53,750
No. Thank you.

623
00:44:03,698 --> 00:44:06,690
"Harry," he says to me,
"you make beautiful pants.

624
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,927
When I was a boy, I dreamed
of wearing pants like these."

625
00:44:10,171 --> 00:44:11,160
His very words, Andy.

626
00:44:11,406 --> 00:44:14,534
To be quite frank,
do we have to meet here?

627
00:44:14,742 --> 00:44:16,733
It's not very salubrious.

628
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,469
Good cover, Harry.

629
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:23,708
They rent the rooms by the hour.
Cash. No questions asked.

630
00:44:23,918 --> 00:44:25,715
No paper trail.

631
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,720
Anyone sees you going in, you're here
to get your end away. Same as me.

632
00:44:33,294 --> 00:44:34,955
So that's it, is it?

633
00:44:35,463 --> 00:44:38,523
Half hour's tête-à-tête
about knickers.

634
00:44:40,134 --> 00:44:41,830
What about the canal?

635
00:44:42,705 --> 00:44:44,969
Did he say anything about his trip?

636
00:44:45,874 --> 00:44:47,171
He had talks, yes.

637
00:44:47,376 --> 00:44:50,834
"Constructive discussions,"
was his phrase, I believe.

638
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:55,373
You're not gonna pay off the farm
at this rate.

639
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:04,116
Andy, this is hard for me.

640
00:45:04,324 --> 00:45:07,760
He confides. A tailor's like a priest
in these situations.

641
00:45:07,961 --> 00:45:11,362
For me, the changing room is
as sacred as the confessional.

642
00:45:11,598 --> 00:45:13,828
Lips are sealed, eh?

643
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:18,870
Have you had a chance to make
arrangements about the farm, Andy?

644
00:45:19,072 --> 00:45:22,872
Well, the money's there,
as long as you deliver.

645
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,220
- He's selling it, Andy.
- What?

646
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:38,882
The canal.

647
00:45:40,228 --> 00:45:41,160
He's selling it?

648
00:45:41,362 --> 00:45:45,765
Has to. Needs the money.
Relieve the poverty. Infrastructure.

649
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,490
Who's buying?

650
00:45:48,469 --> 00:45:49,299
Who's buying?

651
00:45:49,504 --> 00:45:52,200
Various interested parties, I believe.

652
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,641
- Come on.
- He mentioned the French, the Japanese.

653
00:45:55,843 --> 00:45:57,174
And?

654
00:45:58,379 --> 00:45:59,812
Oh, yeah. And the Chinese.

655
00:46:00,014 --> 00:46:01,311
Harry.

656
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:02,948
Andy.

657
00:46:04,085 --> 00:46:05,747
Are you pulling my pisser?

658
00:46:05,954 --> 00:46:08,354
Not unless the president's
pulling mine.

659
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,822
This is fucking dynamite.
Does he always talk to you like this?

660
00:46:12,027 --> 00:46:13,324
Not always...

661
00:46:13,529 --> 00:46:14,587
...but mostly.

662
00:46:14,797 --> 00:46:17,265
Now this is for the record.
Times, names, places.

663
00:46:17,466 --> 00:46:19,525
His actual words, if you
remember them.

664
00:46:19,768 --> 00:46:22,259
Goose it up a bit.
It's going straight to the top.

665
00:46:22,504 --> 00:46:25,234
Here we go.
What kind of Chinese, by the way?

666
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:28,199
You know, Chinese, like Chinese.

667
00:46:28,444 --> 00:46:31,971
Oh, fuck's sake.
I mean, mainland? Taiwan?

668
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,241
The both, Andy. The two together.

669
00:46:37,453 --> 00:46:38,784
Hand in hand.

670
00:46:38,987 --> 00:46:41,683
It's something the president's
very proud of...

671
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:44,324
...bringing them together,
at the same table.

672
00:46:44,526 --> 00:46:49,624
"Harry," he says to me, "if it's all
I'm remembered for, then so be it.

673
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:53,200
I brought reconciliation
to the great Chinese people...

674
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,131
...for the betterment of all mankind."

675
00:46:55,505 --> 00:46:59,066
You've excelled. This is a better
yarn than Arthur Braithwaite.

676
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:00,401
Are you implying...?

677
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,908
Doesn't matter what I think.
It plays.

678
00:47:04,247 --> 00:47:06,442
First installments:
Abraxas and Marta.

679
00:47:06,649 --> 00:47:09,675
- Installments?
- Payment on results, Harry.

680
00:47:09,886 --> 00:47:11,820
And the farm as such, Andy?

681
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:14,889
Looking good.

682
00:47:15,492 --> 00:47:17,119
Oh, look at those tits.

683
00:47:20,363 --> 00:47:21,591
Yum-yum.

684
00:47:24,067 --> 00:47:27,264
You want to pay off the debt?
With what?

685
00:47:27,504 --> 00:47:29,768
Let's say I won the lottery, Ramon.

686
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:32,943
And I want to buy your farm from you.

687
00:47:33,177 --> 00:47:35,645
What do you mean,
you want to buy my farm?

688
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,108
I don't have no farm.

689
00:47:37,314 --> 00:47:41,216
Oh, yes, you do, Ramon.
I know all about it.

690
00:47:42,553 --> 00:47:44,111
Okay.

691
00:47:44,655 --> 00:47:48,091
You won the lottery, you can
pay me $3000 an acre.

692
00:47:48,292 --> 00:47:51,523
Two. You'll be paid
direct from Europe.

693
00:47:51,729 --> 00:47:54,755
I've made the necessary arrangements.

694
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:03,804
You won't mind if I deduct
your tailoring bill?

695
00:48:09,547 --> 00:48:11,515
It has a bad smell.

696
00:48:12,049 --> 00:48:13,608
That would be the fish.

697
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:20,352
I'll pay you back.
I'm going to straighten out.

698
00:48:21,126 --> 00:48:24,220
Just don't resent me
for doing you a favor.

699
00:48:26,731 --> 00:48:31,862
Harry, this is Panama, where no
good deed goes unpunished.

700
00:49:11,477 --> 00:49:12,603
Right.

701
00:49:13,946 --> 00:49:16,879
There's two ways we can deal
with this one, old girl.

702
00:49:17,081 --> 00:49:20,482
Sweat it out for six months,
then fall into each other's arms:

703
00:49:20,684 --> 00:49:23,482
"Darling, why didn't we ever
do this before?"

704
00:49:23,687 --> 00:49:26,918
Method B, the preferred one:

705
00:49:27,124 --> 00:49:30,287
Full-on affair now.
Observing tight security all round.

706
00:49:30,494 --> 00:49:33,588
See how we like it.
If we don't, no one's the wiser.

707
00:49:33,797 --> 00:49:38,633
I don't suppose it's occurred to you
that I might prefer someone else?

708
00:49:42,741 --> 00:49:43,730
Is that a no?

709
00:49:46,745 --> 00:49:47,837
No.

710
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:53,511
Come and dance.

711
00:49:54,653 --> 00:49:57,315
Oh, God, you don't dance as well,
do you?

712
00:49:58,356 --> 00:49:59,846
As well as what?

713
00:51:33,053 --> 00:51:36,784
My chaps in London are in a bit
of a spin about it.

714
00:51:37,024 --> 00:51:39,322
I understand they're talking
to Washington.

715
00:51:39,526 --> 00:51:43,155
If the canal's being sold out,
how come we never got a whisper of it?

716
00:51:43,363 --> 00:51:45,423
I'm sure the question
is being asked...

717
00:51:45,633 --> 00:51:48,363
...and not to your credit, Nigel,
as political officer.

718
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:49,695
What about the Americans?

719
00:51:49,904 --> 00:51:53,396
They've got billions in
surveillance. They don't know?

720
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:56,633
Perhaps they do know about it,
but they're not telling us.

721
00:51:58,312 --> 00:52:00,576
You're very quiet, Francesca.

722
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:04,684
What are your feelings about
Andrew's amazing discoveries?

723
00:52:05,353 --> 00:52:07,787
Well, I couldn't possibly comment.

724
00:52:08,589 --> 00:52:11,490
No insight into the Osnard methods,
I'm afraid.

725
00:52:40,089 --> 00:52:41,989
Try not to look so furtive, Harry.

726
00:52:42,191 --> 00:52:45,217
- I'm feeling a little anxious.
- How do you think I feel?

727
00:52:45,427 --> 00:52:46,655
- Something wrong?
- Yes.

728
00:52:46,862 --> 00:52:48,887
We bombed in Washington.
Sit down.

729
00:52:49,131 --> 00:52:52,760
The Yanks say we're talking through
our asses. No Silent Opposition.

730
00:52:52,968 --> 00:52:55,801
No conspiracy to sell off the canal.
No fuck-all.

731
00:52:56,004 --> 00:52:58,529
- They can't say that.
- They just said it.

732
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:04,771
The Buchan material
holds no credibility.

733
00:53:05,013 --> 00:53:07,641
No credibility equals no cash.

734
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:11,452
Without the Yanks, London will
pull the entire project.

735
00:53:11,654 --> 00:53:15,215
- Why?
- Because in matters of intelligence...

736
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:16,949
...as in most other matters...

737
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,755
...merry England sucks
on the American hind tit.

738
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,194
It's called,
"The special relationship."

739
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:28,671
Mickie will be very downcast, Andy.
So will Marta.

740
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:32,328
What about us? We both had
a good thing going here.

741
00:53:33,107 --> 00:53:34,938
I was counting on making a pension.

742
00:53:35,176 --> 00:53:37,041
You thinking of retiring?

743
00:53:40,948 --> 00:53:42,973
Scrap heap at 45 in this game.

744
00:53:43,217 --> 00:53:45,845
It was blue chip material.
You said so yourself.

745
00:53:46,053 --> 00:53:50,581
London needs something solid.
Documents, evidence.

746
00:53:52,194 --> 00:53:56,358
Does your wife bring home papers,
canal stuff?

747
00:53:56,865 --> 00:54:00,164
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Does she? That's all.

748
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:01,563
It happens.

749
00:54:07,276 --> 00:54:08,868
Take a look up its skirt.

750
00:54:15,651 --> 00:54:17,778
Come here. Come here.
Give it back.

751
00:54:19,788 --> 00:54:20,982
It's a camera.

752
00:54:22,891 --> 00:54:27,385
One picture's worth a thousand words.
Or a thousand bucks. Tell her that.

753
00:54:27,696 --> 00:54:28,560
- Tell her?
- Why not?

754
00:54:28,764 --> 00:54:31,255
Put her on the payroll.
Double your money.

755
00:54:31,567 --> 00:54:35,197
I want something in writing on
Delgado's dealings with the Chinese.

756
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:36,565
No more bullshit.

757
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,367
Louisa would never betray Delgado.

758
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,940
She worships the man.

759
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,878
Does she know where you're at?

760
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,574
Not an inkling.

761
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,880
Ever tell her about your prison days?

762
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:50,109
Not as such.

763
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,844
Haul her in, Harry...

764
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:55,422
...or I might have to tell her
about Harry Pendel, the criminal.

765
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,388
You stay away from her.

766
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:03,731
Okay, I'll handle it.

767
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:15,270
You're rather tense tonight, Lou.

768
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,945
Maybe because you're peering
over my shoulder again.

769
00:55:21,252 --> 00:55:23,652
Or maybe because I had a call
from Donna.

770
00:55:25,356 --> 00:55:26,186
Donna?

771
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:27,784
Teddy's wife.

772
00:55:30,127 --> 00:55:33,255
She said you were seen coming
out of the Hotel Paraiso.

773
00:55:34,632 --> 00:55:39,160
I said, "Harry's a tailor. He has
clients from all walks of life."

774
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:41,662
True.

775
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:44,373
You'd never meet them
at the Hotel Paraiso.

776
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:48,433
I had a fitting with Andy.
Andy Osnard.

777
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:49,977
He's a bit eccentric.

778
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,571
Are you seeing someone?

779
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,008
Me?

780
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:01,518
You stay out late
and you don't say where.

781
00:56:03,895 --> 00:56:07,331
You come at me like a lover and
then you don't touch me for weeks.

782
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:11,225
What's going on, Harry?

783
00:56:12,237 --> 00:56:13,864
Who's getting the rest of you?

784
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:16,573
Uncle Benny, I'm cornered.

785
00:56:16,975 --> 00:56:19,375
There's nothing for it
but to tell her the truth.

786
00:56:19,911 --> 00:56:21,401
She deserves the truth.

787
00:56:21,646 --> 00:56:24,080
Harry-boy, I've told you
time and again:

788
00:56:24,316 --> 00:56:27,979
A man who tells the truth is bound
to be found out sooner or later.

789
00:56:28,186 --> 00:56:30,711
Try sincerity, that's a virtue.

790
00:56:30,922 --> 00:56:33,584
But truth, it's an affliction.

791
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:35,817
I swear to you on my life...

792
00:56:37,128 --> 00:56:38,527
...there's no other woman.

793
00:56:39,965 --> 00:56:43,060
Never has been. Never will be.

794
00:56:46,272 --> 00:56:47,398
Okay.

795
00:56:56,248 --> 00:56:57,613
Louisa?

796
00:57:42,362 --> 00:57:44,692
I'm a thief in my own home.

797
00:57:44,896 --> 00:57:48,161
<i>But with best intentions.
With a good heart.</i>

798
00:57:48,633 --> 00:57:51,227
<i>For the family.
Like you did for me.</i>

799
00:57:51,436 --> 00:57:52,562
That's true.

800
00:57:52,771 --> 00:57:54,898
<i>You're the apple of my eye, Harry.</i>

801
00:57:55,106 --> 00:57:58,667
<i>Stay shtum, and I'll
always be there for you.</i>

802
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:02,446
Harry. Harry!

803
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,845
I couldn't sleep.

804
00:58:09,288 --> 00:58:12,587
What do you mean you couldn't sleep?
You were just out cold.

805
00:58:14,226 --> 00:58:16,285
Busy times at the shop, Lou.

806
00:58:17,229 --> 00:58:19,595
So who is this Andy Osnard?

807
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:23,532
- Tell me about him.
- He's become a bit of a pal...

808
00:58:23,903 --> 00:58:24,870
...as such.

809
00:58:26,372 --> 00:58:28,306
I used to be your pal...

810
00:58:28,507 --> 00:58:29,804
..."as such."

811
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:32,502
I'd like to meet him.

812
00:58:32,745 --> 00:58:35,213
Why don't you invite him on Sunday?

813
00:58:36,148 --> 00:58:37,740
That's Sarah's birthday.

814
00:58:38,651 --> 00:58:39,675
Why not?

815
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:42,550
I could look into it.

816
00:58:43,055 --> 00:58:45,523
If you don't want to call him,
I'll call him.

817
00:58:47,326 --> 00:58:48,225
Good.

818
00:59:05,545 --> 00:59:07,877
- And this season's suits
are very thin...

819
00:59:08,115 --> 00:59:10,345
...and it's lined with Panama's
best fabric.

820
00:59:18,959 --> 00:59:20,119
Buchan.

821
00:59:20,393 --> 00:59:23,362
Lady Jane's. Twenty minutes.
That's two-zero minutes.

822
00:59:24,064 --> 00:59:25,326
Over and out.

823
01:00:11,512 --> 01:00:13,777
He's been waiting and complaining.

824
01:00:14,149 --> 01:00:18,586
Sorry, Teddy. Jacket's ready.
Just pop into the fitting room.

825
01:00:24,026 --> 01:00:25,823
Sorry, Jaime, I need this.

826
01:00:31,466 --> 01:00:33,024
In you go, Teddy.

827
01:00:38,807 --> 01:00:40,934
Wow! Even better than I thought.

828
01:00:41,143 --> 01:00:43,577
You look like Bobby De Niro
in this jacket.

829
01:00:43,779 --> 01:00:46,976
Don't schmooze me, Harry.
What's going on?

830
01:00:47,216 --> 01:00:49,810
Little bird tells me
you paid off your overdraft.

831
01:00:50,052 --> 01:00:51,644
Business is good, Teddy.

832
01:00:51,887 --> 01:00:53,718
I smell a story.

833
01:00:53,922 --> 01:00:55,288
There's no story.

834
01:00:56,159 --> 01:00:58,252
You want me to make one up?

835
01:00:58,461 --> 01:01:00,588
Don't. Louisa reads
your gossip column.

836
01:01:00,797 --> 01:01:02,788
I don't want her to know
I owed money.

837
01:01:02,999 --> 01:01:04,830
Come clean.

838
01:01:05,401 --> 01:01:07,460
Probably won't run it.

839
01:01:07,971 --> 01:01:11,532
I'm like that. The more I know,
the less I print.

840
01:01:16,279 --> 01:01:18,611
You know I'll find out
what you're up to...

841
01:01:19,582 --> 01:01:20,776
...don't you?

842
01:01:47,678 --> 01:01:49,942
Well, I had absolutely no idea...

843
01:01:50,147 --> 01:01:52,240
...how delightful
Panama was gonna be.

844
01:01:52,449 --> 01:01:54,849
Yes, it's beautiful country.

845
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:57,744
I was thinking about the people.

846
01:01:59,021 --> 01:02:02,457
Meant a lot to me,
being able to tag along today.

847
01:02:02,658 --> 01:02:05,286
It's been a real pleasure
to have you along, Andy.

848
01:02:05,494 --> 01:02:06,722
Hasn't it, darling?

849
01:02:07,596 --> 01:02:09,655
Can we go and see the monkeys, Dad?

850
01:02:10,198 --> 01:02:11,392
There's a monkey island.

851
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,568
- We bring bananas for them.
- Wonderful.

852
01:02:13,769 --> 01:02:16,499
- What's my birthday girl say?
- Can Andy come too?

853
01:02:16,705 --> 01:02:20,335
No, Andy needs to stay here
and keep Mommy company.

854
01:02:20,543 --> 01:02:21,942
You go with Dad.

855
01:02:30,853 --> 01:02:31,820
In you go.

856
01:02:32,055 --> 01:02:33,750
Cast off, captain.

857
01:02:40,029 --> 01:02:41,462
So, Andy...

858
01:02:41,831 --> 01:02:44,800
...maybe you wouldn't mind
telling me what you're up to.

859
01:02:48,071 --> 01:02:49,095
Sorry?

860
01:02:49,372 --> 01:02:53,775
There's something between you and my
husband, I know it. I can feel it.

861
01:02:54,777 --> 01:02:58,873
Ever since he's met you, he's
a changed man. Sneaky and secretive.

862
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:05,916
All of a sudden, I'm his enemy
and you're his friend.

863
01:03:08,692 --> 01:03:11,786
If I didn't know him better,
I'd say you two were gay.

864
01:03:17,801 --> 01:03:19,735
Do you want it straight?

865
01:03:21,972 --> 01:03:23,098
Always.

866
01:03:23,474 --> 01:03:24,941
You'll keep it secret?

867
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:27,599
If I have to.

868
01:03:31,115 --> 01:03:34,778
And he's told you nothing?
Absolutely nothing?

869
01:03:35,352 --> 01:03:36,546
Zero.

870
01:03:37,788 --> 01:03:40,018
Information is my business. Gossip.

871
01:03:40,224 --> 01:03:41,816
Harry's kind of gossip.

872
01:03:42,025 --> 01:03:44,256
He's smart, he's down-to-earth.

873
01:03:44,462 --> 01:03:46,589
He's got great contacts and no agenda.

874
01:03:47,065 --> 01:03:49,192
Are you talking about spying?

875
01:03:49,801 --> 01:03:53,760
Oh, that's much too heavy a word
for what Harry's doing.

876
01:03:54,973 --> 01:03:58,932
- Are you paying him?
- No money, I'm afraid.

877
01:03:59,144 --> 01:04:01,510
Just the honor
and privilege of service.

878
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:07,779
Is that why he's been looking
at all my private papers?

879
01:04:08,586 --> 01:04:10,679
Oh, no. Harry.

880
01:04:11,322 --> 01:04:12,482
Oh, bless him.

881
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:15,824
That really is going too far.

882
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:19,856
Spying on his own wife.

883
01:04:24,002 --> 01:04:25,333
I'm terribly sorry.

884
01:04:27,773 --> 01:04:30,936
Still, you are the canal, aren't you?

885
01:04:31,143 --> 01:04:34,112
You sit at Ernie Delgado's right hand.

886
01:04:34,647 --> 01:04:38,640
Harry's aware that we're desperate
to know what will become of it.

887
01:04:41,353 --> 01:04:44,186
The canal is always gonna run
the way it's run.

888
01:04:45,758 --> 01:04:47,988
Ernie Delgado will make sure of it.

889
01:04:48,194 --> 01:04:49,661
That's as may be...

890
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:52,625
...but it's our main artery.

891
01:04:52,832 --> 01:04:55,858
You can't blame us if we need
constant reassurance.

892
01:04:58,571 --> 01:05:00,505
Harry's only trying to help.

893
01:05:02,408 --> 01:05:03,636
Don't...

894
01:05:05,344 --> 01:05:06,777
...use him.

895
01:05:08,515 --> 01:05:09,880
I love him.

896
01:05:10,917 --> 01:05:12,782
As we both do.

897
01:05:13,687 --> 01:05:15,177
I'm going for a swim.

898
01:05:17,757 --> 01:05:18,724
- There's one.
- Where?

899
01:05:18,925 --> 01:05:19,892
- Up there.
- Oh, yeah!

900
01:05:20,093 --> 01:05:21,890
Oh, he's lovely!

901
01:05:27,033 --> 01:05:28,295
So...

902
01:05:30,504 --> 01:05:33,803
Tell me,
how did Harry win your heart?

903
01:05:35,876 --> 01:05:38,174
I was raised in the canal...

904
01:05:38,445 --> 01:05:41,209
...around military types
and engineers like my father...

905
01:05:41,414 --> 01:05:43,780
...and I had never met anyone
like Harry.

906
01:05:43,984 --> 01:05:46,248
He treated me like a princess.

907
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,981
Sent me flowers every day.

908
01:05:49,222 --> 01:05:50,656
Wrote me love letters.

909
01:05:50,858 --> 01:05:54,794
Did he have to get
Arthur Braithwaite's permission?

910
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:59,828
He called him in London.
He was on his deathbed, the poor man.

911
01:06:00,034 --> 01:06:01,399
Oh, God.

912
01:06:03,104 --> 01:06:05,265
Did he fly over for the funeral?

913
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,598
Arthur forbade it.

914
01:06:08,109 --> 01:06:11,567
Harry was completely wiped out.

915
01:06:12,111 --> 01:06:13,874
I'm sure he was.

916
01:06:23,789 --> 01:06:28,488
So the two of you have lived
happily ever after ever since?

917
01:06:30,996 --> 01:06:33,022
Yeah, until you came along.

918
01:06:35,535 --> 01:06:37,230
Don't you ever feel like...

919
01:06:38,138 --> 01:06:39,799
...breaking out?

920
01:06:42,509 --> 01:06:44,170
Running wild...

921
01:06:45,178 --> 01:06:47,203
...just for the badness?

922
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:51,712
Never.

923
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:55,388
Harry is my virtue.

924
01:06:57,357 --> 01:06:58,654
Without him...

925
01:07:01,161 --> 01:07:02,389
...I'd be...

926
01:07:02,596 --> 01:07:03,995
You'd be...

927
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:07,425
...like Harry without
Arthur Braithwaite.

928
01:07:21,616 --> 01:07:24,016
Well, she's finally asleep.

929
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,054
I think she enjoyed her day.

930
01:07:28,589 --> 01:07:30,113
Yeah, I think so too.

931
01:07:35,696 --> 01:07:37,027
And did you?

932
01:07:37,598 --> 01:07:40,089
Yeah. Kind of.

933
01:07:40,968 --> 01:07:43,300
What did you and Andy
find to talk about?

934
01:07:45,506 --> 01:07:46,939
You, mostly.

935
01:07:47,308 --> 01:07:49,503
Bit of a boring topic, wasn't it?

936
01:07:50,578 --> 01:07:54,537
You're a very surprising person,
Harry Pendel.

937
01:07:55,883 --> 01:07:58,148
After all these years?

938
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:01,846
Just don't come between me
and Ernie Delgado.

939
01:08:02,324 --> 01:08:05,589
My work is off-limits.
Do you understand?

940
01:08:05,794 --> 01:08:08,126
Okay, Lou. Absolutely.

941
01:08:08,697 --> 01:08:09,891
Done.

942
01:08:19,875 --> 01:08:21,069
Harry.

943
01:08:21,877 --> 01:08:22,866
What?

944
01:08:24,012 --> 01:08:25,775
Make me laugh.

945
01:08:35,357 --> 01:08:37,757
- You've got a gift for it.
- What?

946
01:08:39,628 --> 01:08:40,789
Letting go.

947
01:08:41,964 --> 01:08:46,025
- Few people can.
- You can't, or won't.

948
01:08:46,803 --> 01:08:47,895
No.

949
01:08:48,538 --> 01:08:52,668
- I've been reading your files.
- Oh, those fucking files.

950
01:08:54,444 --> 01:08:56,878
We know too much about each other.

951
01:08:58,414 --> 01:09:00,348
Kills the romance.

952
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:02,283
What romance?

953
01:09:03,019 --> 01:09:05,886
Oh, shit! Shit.

954
01:09:09,492 --> 01:09:10,516
Yes?

955
01:09:11,194 --> 01:09:13,219
Yeah. What?

956
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:16,530
It's a bit of a bad time, actually.

957
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:19,665
I didn't know what she knew,
did I?

958
01:09:21,637 --> 01:09:24,505
Well, I'm sure you handled it
like a master.

959
01:09:25,542 --> 01:09:28,739
Look... Hey, I had to think
on my feet, didn't I?

960
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:30,610
All right.

961
01:09:31,415 --> 01:09:32,905
All right, if you must.

962
01:09:34,485 --> 01:09:36,077
Rendezvous number three.

963
01:09:37,421 --> 01:09:40,652
You know where that is, don't you?
Oh, good.

964
01:09:41,358 --> 01:09:43,326
Twenty-three hundred hours.
Good.

965
01:09:45,462 --> 01:09:48,898
What warrants dragging me out of
the saddle on a Sunday night, eh?

966
01:09:49,133 --> 01:09:50,100
Look, about Louisa.

967
01:09:50,334 --> 01:09:53,861
Some woman, Harry. I envy you.
The way she looks up to you.

968
01:09:54,071 --> 01:09:56,403
You're her moral virtue, her center.

969
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:59,872
Just like Arthur Braithwaite
was to you, is what she said.

970
01:10:00,377 --> 01:10:01,742
I enjoyed the comparison.

971
01:10:01,945 --> 01:10:03,572
- You say anything?
- Would I ever?

972
01:10:03,781 --> 01:10:06,649
Expect me to tell her that
an old Jew brought me up?

973
01:10:06,851 --> 01:10:08,819
Burned his frocks as a favor?

974
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:10,681
Hated the old fellow, did you?

975
01:10:10,889 --> 01:10:14,689
- I know this place where we can talk.
- I loved him. I revere him.

976
01:10:14,926 --> 01:10:18,259
Dressed him up as Arthur Braithwaite.
Gave him a good suit.

977
01:10:18,463 --> 01:10:20,931
"Clothes maketh the man,"
and all that.

978
01:10:51,495 --> 01:10:54,555
Come on, let's dance.
Camp it up a bit.

979
01:11:15,385 --> 01:11:17,512
Come on. I'll lead.

980
01:11:19,523 --> 01:11:23,015
So, I gather you've made
no attempt to recruit her so far.

981
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:25,558
As of now, that is correct.

982
01:11:25,762 --> 01:11:27,821
Seemed perfectly approachable to me.

983
01:11:28,065 --> 01:11:31,297
- Thought I'd have a go at her myself.
- No, don't do that.

984
01:11:32,203 --> 01:11:34,728
Is this what you came to tell me?
Lay off her?

985
01:11:34,939 --> 01:11:37,237
I came to tell you
I've had enough.

986
01:11:37,575 --> 01:11:38,405
I want out.

987
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:42,341
I don't think so. You've taken
the money, I want something for it.

988
01:11:42,981 --> 01:11:44,448
Those documents.

989
01:11:44,649 --> 01:11:47,243
Those ones that you snapped.
Did you read them?

990
01:11:47,452 --> 01:11:50,888
- I was pushed for time, Andy.
- Pension scheme for lock-keepers.

991
01:11:51,089 --> 01:11:53,922
Dredging contract.
Water analysis. Zilch.

992
01:11:54,158 --> 01:11:56,649
Time to deliver.
I'm tired of your bullshit.

993
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:58,328
I can't go on with it!

994
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:00,861
You want me to tell Louisa...

995
01:12:01,065 --> 01:12:02,862
...about Harry the convict?

996
01:12:07,405 --> 01:12:09,339
Will you tell me what you want?

997
01:12:09,707 --> 01:12:10,731
Come here.

998
01:12:11,276 --> 01:12:14,041
Keep moving. Stop acting so butch.

999
01:12:15,314 --> 01:12:19,751
If the canal's being flogged off
on presidential instructions...

1000
01:12:19,952 --> 01:12:23,888
...what's the price? Who's the buyer?
When do they sign the contract?

1001
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:27,855
How much are Delgado and the pres
creaming off for themselves?

1002
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:29,560
- Right.
- Can't hear you.

1003
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,855
- Right.
- Then there's your end of the bargain.

1004
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:36,329
Abraxas, the Silent Opposition.
Are they going for direct action?

1005
01:12:36,535 --> 01:12:39,698
- Direct action being in this case?
- Shootibangs.

1006
01:12:39,905 --> 01:12:42,066
Raising proletarian consciousness.

1007
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:45,038
Bombing banks, gunning down
a couple millionaires.

1008
01:12:45,244 --> 01:12:49,044
- No, not Mickie, not Marta.
- So, what the fuck are they doing?

1009
01:12:49,248 --> 01:12:53,014
Who are they buying arms from?
What are they gonna do with them?

1010
01:12:53,218 --> 01:12:55,983
They'll have to do more than
wear white shirts...

1011
01:12:56,189 --> 01:12:59,090
...and get the shit beaten
out of them by the dingbats!

1012
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,192
- Come on.
- I've got to get out.

1013
01:13:01,428 --> 01:13:03,020
I can't think.

1014
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,894
- I can't breathe.
- Go, Harry. Go, go, go.

1015
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:12,764
Get me some answers.
Your ass is on the line.

1016
01:13:12,973 --> 01:13:15,737
London's coming.
Get the stuff, we make you rich.

1017
01:13:15,942 --> 01:13:19,343
You don't, we tell the Pans
you've been spying for the Yanks.

1018
01:13:19,546 --> 01:13:22,743
You and Louisa both.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1019
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:34,092
I haven't come clean with you.

1020
01:13:35,028 --> 01:13:36,894
I've been dragging my feet.

1021
01:13:37,264 --> 01:13:39,289
At Mickie's behest, I might add.

1022
01:13:40,401 --> 01:13:42,995
He has a huge arms shipment
on the way.

1023
01:13:43,204 --> 01:13:45,604
But he'll pay for it
from another source.

1024
01:13:45,806 --> 01:13:48,832
Oh, yeah? Who the fuck would that be?

1025
01:13:49,043 --> 01:13:50,374
Won't say.

1026
01:13:50,778 --> 01:13:52,678
No, he wouldn't, would he?

1027
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,974
- How much?
- It's big money, Andy.

1028
01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:59,209
"Harry," he says to me,
"your guys pay peanuts.

1029
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:01,047
This is out of their league."

1030
01:14:02,156 --> 01:14:03,282
Well...

1031
01:14:04,492 --> 01:14:07,256
...this is an interesting
development, Harry.

1032
01:14:07,928 --> 01:14:10,362
- Give me a ballpark figure.
- Ten.

1033
01:14:10,564 --> 01:14:13,260
We're talking
ten million dollars, Andy.

1034
01:14:13,467 --> 01:14:14,934
Ten million dollars?

1035
01:14:15,736 --> 01:14:16,703
Yeah.

1036
01:14:17,438 --> 01:14:20,033
Ten million dollars.

1037
01:14:22,844 --> 01:14:24,141
Yeah.

1038
01:14:33,522 --> 01:14:35,183
- Andrew.
- Sir.

1039
01:14:35,390 --> 01:14:37,620
The winds of fortune
blew me to Caracas...

1040
01:14:37,826 --> 01:14:41,316
...allowing me this brief stopover.
I'm on my way to Washington.

1041
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:45,930
Our revered leader, Henry Cavendish,
is coming too. Pick up the phone.

1042
01:14:46,166 --> 01:14:48,066
There's prestige at stake, you see.

1043
01:14:48,268 --> 01:14:49,132
Oh, Andrew...

1044
01:14:50,036 --> 01:14:54,132
...I've come all this way to look
you in the eye and ask you this:

1045
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:58,606
Can you back it up?
Are we copper-bottomed?

1046
01:14:59,979 --> 01:15:01,242
Yes.

1047
01:15:03,417 --> 01:15:06,853
- How much are they asking for?
- Fifteen million.

1048
01:15:07,388 --> 01:15:08,650
Fifteen.

1049
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:12,288
If I get it for you,
can you guarantee action?

1050
01:15:12,593 --> 01:15:13,958
Oh, absolutely.

1051
01:15:14,195 --> 01:15:15,662
Go after them, Andrew.

1052
01:15:15,863 --> 01:15:19,663
Push. The iron is hot.
Strike!

1053
01:15:23,671 --> 01:15:26,970
Sir, can I have your glass?
We are ready for landing.

1054
01:15:30,044 --> 01:15:31,238
Thank you.

1055
01:15:41,489 --> 01:15:44,220
Oh, Harry. I hear that Delgado...

1056
01:15:44,426 --> 01:15:47,486
...is setting up a canal
police force...

1057
01:15:47,729 --> 01:15:49,754
...with powers to search the ships.

1058
01:15:49,998 --> 01:15:55,300
It'll never happen. It would kill
the drug trade, the arms trade...

1059
01:15:55,537 --> 01:15:57,698
...everything we hold dear.

1060
01:15:58,106 --> 01:16:00,768
The way it is now,
you pay your dues...

1061
01:16:00,976 --> 01:16:04,571
...you don't piss in the locks,
they don't fuck with you.

1062
01:16:04,779 --> 01:16:08,044
Does Louisa know anything
about this little plan, Harry?

1063
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:09,808
Leave Louisa out of this.

1064
01:16:10,018 --> 01:16:14,318
Take it easy, Harry.
Time you took some holiday.

1065
01:16:15,023 --> 01:16:18,424
- You look fucked out.
- Maybe if you paid your bill...

1066
01:16:18,627 --> 01:16:21,323
...I might be able to.
- Maybe you'd be healthier...

1067
01:16:21,563 --> 01:16:23,258
...if you stuck to tailoring.

1068
01:16:23,565 --> 01:16:25,796
- Listen, Teddy...
- Hey, Harry.

1069
01:16:26,435 --> 01:16:27,902
It doesn't look right.

1070
01:16:28,137 --> 01:16:30,298
This isn't a suit,
it's a piece of shit.

1071
01:16:31,908 --> 01:16:34,843
Come on, it's the first fitting.
It can be fixed.

1072
01:16:35,044 --> 01:16:37,410
I don't know.
Think I'm gonna go to Armani.

1073
01:16:37,747 --> 01:16:39,738
Get myself a proper suit.

1074
01:16:42,451 --> 01:16:45,318
He doesn't like it when
I mention Armani.

1075
01:16:45,521 --> 01:16:47,614
Harry, why you make me this shit?

1076
01:16:47,823 --> 01:16:49,848
Why can't you make
a suit like Armani?

1077
01:16:50,059 --> 01:16:51,822
Why can't I make
a suit like Armani?

1078
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:57,426
You think Armani can make
a suit like Harry Pendel?

1079
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:58,928
Why not?

1080
01:16:59,368 --> 01:17:02,963
Okay, fuck off. Go down the road,
buy an Armani!

1081
01:17:03,172 --> 01:17:05,697
Save yourself $1000,
see if I care!

1082
01:17:05,908 --> 01:17:08,844
At Pendel and Braithwaite
you get Savile Row tailoring...

1083
01:17:09,046 --> 01:17:11,173
...with 400 years of tradition
behind it.

1084
01:17:11,381 --> 01:17:14,043
Down the road you get an
Italian gents' outfitter.

1085
01:17:14,251 --> 01:17:16,947
If you don't understand,
then save your money.

1086
01:17:17,154 --> 01:17:18,519
Hey, Harry, come on.

1087
01:17:19,122 --> 01:17:22,057
The whole country's
going down the plug hole!

1088
01:17:22,259 --> 01:17:24,250
Nobody cares!

1089
01:17:24,461 --> 01:17:27,055
Someone's got to stand up
and be counted!

1090
01:17:27,297 --> 01:17:31,063
Someone has to say, "Here I am.
This is what I stand for!"

1091
01:17:31,268 --> 01:17:33,259
Impeccable standards and...

1092
01:17:33,503 --> 01:17:35,164
...and old-fashioned integrity!

1093
01:17:35,372 --> 01:17:38,205
And if you don't like it,
you can go down the road!

1094
01:17:38,642 --> 01:17:40,701
Gentlemen, you go down that road...

1095
01:17:40,911 --> 01:17:42,344
...you can never come back.

1096
01:17:42,546 --> 01:17:46,038
When you've gone down that road
it's over, it's curtains.

1097
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:48,650
And I'm not just talking about Panama!

1098
01:17:48,852 --> 01:17:51,913
I'm talking about
the whole human race.

1099
01:18:01,866 --> 01:18:04,266
You too. Get out.

1100
01:18:09,173 --> 01:18:11,641
Harry, I was only kidding, I swear.

1101
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:15,841
It's just a sleeve.
I swear to God.

1102
01:18:23,588 --> 01:18:25,146
Teddy came to see Mickie.

1103
01:18:25,356 --> 01:18:29,224
He brought two goons with him.
Said they were Ministry of Interior.

1104
01:18:29,427 --> 01:18:30,519
Teddy?

1105
01:18:30,795 --> 01:18:32,593
Of course, he's the worst.

1106
01:18:32,798 --> 01:18:34,925
They pay him, the ruling families.

1107
01:18:35,167 --> 01:18:37,328
He takes money to inform
on his friends.

1108
01:18:37,703 --> 01:18:39,728
They were asking around about us.

1109
01:18:40,372 --> 01:18:41,896
They came to me too.

1110
01:18:42,808 --> 01:18:46,209
Thinks we're involved in a
political thing against the system.

1111
01:18:46,412 --> 01:18:48,004
You know, like the old times.

1112
01:18:48,213 --> 01:18:50,681
- You and Marta?
- You and Mickie.

1113
01:18:50,883 --> 01:18:52,680
Why would they think that?

1114
01:18:53,118 --> 01:18:54,378
Maybe you know, Harry.

1115
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,649
I couldn't do it again.

1116
01:18:59,656 --> 01:19:03,217
No more prison.
They break you in there.

1117
01:19:04,394 --> 01:19:07,852
You got so much courage in life.
When it's gone, it's spent.

1118
01:19:09,032 --> 01:19:10,522
I got none left.

1119
01:19:10,734 --> 01:19:13,703
I know what you mean.
I've been there, I know.

1120
01:19:17,241 --> 01:19:18,538
And they came to you?

1121
01:19:20,411 --> 01:19:24,006
Big Chinese guy.
The man who beat her before.

1122
01:19:24,849 --> 01:19:28,683
- What did they do to you?
- Nothing. They wanted information.

1123
01:19:28,886 --> 01:19:33,550
If I didn't give it to them, they'd
make me look the same, both sides.

1124
01:19:33,758 --> 01:19:36,454
- What information?
- About the two of you.

1125
01:19:36,661 --> 01:19:38,754
How often you meet,
what you talk about.

1126
01:19:38,996 --> 01:19:42,693
I want you both to get out of town.
Take a holiday.

1127
01:19:43,434 --> 01:19:45,868
There's a fireworks festival
in Guarare.

1128
01:19:46,104 --> 01:19:48,800
You love fireworks.
The address is on the label.

1129
01:19:49,006 --> 01:19:50,997
Pete Abuleira lent it to me.

1130
01:19:51,209 --> 01:19:52,938
What are you going to do?

1131
01:19:53,144 --> 01:19:54,577
Sort it out.

1132
01:19:55,313 --> 01:19:57,111
Talk to people I know.

1133
01:20:00,185 --> 01:20:02,050
Better we go in separate cars.

1134
01:20:02,254 --> 01:20:03,448
I follow you later.

1135
01:20:03,655 --> 01:20:05,452
No more drinking now.

1136
01:20:07,159 --> 01:20:08,592
Thanks, Harry.

1137
01:20:09,194 --> 01:20:10,024
Take care.

1138
01:20:15,434 --> 01:20:18,130
I never lied to you, Marta.
You know that.

1139
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:21,897
I didn't tell you everything,
but what I told you was true.

1140
01:20:22,541 --> 01:20:26,671
There's only so many people you
can do that to. Tell the truth.

1141
01:20:27,212 --> 01:20:29,772
Other people are different.
They need to be...

1142
01:20:30,015 --> 01:20:31,346
Tailored.

1143
01:20:31,784 --> 01:20:33,411
Helped. Yes.

1144
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,689
You flatter them. You make things up.

1145
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:40,919
They start believing you, Harry.

1146
01:20:41,194 --> 01:20:44,561
Their leading man is one
Michelangelo Abraxas.

1147
01:20:44,931 --> 01:20:48,230
<i>Known to many, I am sure,
as the elusive Pimpernel...</i>

1148
01:20:48,468 --> 01:20:52,461
<i>... of the popular movement
against General Manuel Noriega.</i>

1149
01:20:52,772 --> 01:20:55,240
<i>Abraxas is a man
of proven integrity...</i>

1150
01:20:55,442 --> 01:20:57,637
<i>... skilled in clandestine warfare.</i>

1151
01:20:58,311 --> 01:20:59,869
His second in command...

1152
01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:03,014
...but I submit his equal
in skill and resolution...

1153
01:21:03,216 --> 01:21:04,843
...is code name "Marta."

1154
01:21:05,251 --> 01:21:08,778
Another veteran of the
anti-Noriega resistance.

1155
01:21:09,289 --> 01:21:12,656
For cover purposes, she is
employed as accountant receptionist...

1156
01:21:12,859 --> 01:21:15,350
...by our own Panamanian head agent...

1157
01:21:15,562 --> 01:21:17,496
...the redoubtable Buchan.

1158
01:21:18,198 --> 01:21:21,258
If I may say so, Elliot,
a "Silent Opposition"...

1159
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:23,493
...doesn't send radio messages.

1160
01:21:23,704 --> 01:21:25,399
Half don't possess telephones.

1161
01:21:25,639 --> 01:21:28,699
Why else would they call
themselves silent?

1162
01:21:28,943 --> 01:21:31,138
They're a life-force, not an embassy.

1163
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:33,677
Fishermen...

1164
01:21:34,982 --> 01:21:38,213
...small farmers, peasants,
have-nots, penniless students.

1165
01:21:38,419 --> 01:21:40,979
People we wouldn't
entertain in the woodshed.

1166
01:21:41,255 --> 01:21:43,917
So why should we support them, Henry?

1167
01:21:44,124 --> 01:21:46,490
Because if we don't,
someone else will.

1168
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:50,391
Because the Silent Opposition is
the new Panama in the new millennium.

1169
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:52,926
And getting in with these chaps...

1170
01:21:53,133 --> 01:21:56,694
...is the sweetest, cheapest
way of saving the canal.

1171
01:21:57,338 --> 01:22:00,239
Do you think personally,
this Abraxas is...

1172
01:22:00,441 --> 01:22:03,035
...presidential material?

1173
01:22:03,244 --> 01:22:04,075
Scotty.

1174
01:22:04,312 --> 01:22:07,281
Abraxas is world-class.
Courageous...

1175
01:22:07,482 --> 01:22:10,349
<i>... unsullied, incorruptible.</i>

1176
01:22:10,552 --> 01:22:13,419
<i>A man to dream of
when you're shaping nations.</i>

1177
01:22:25,133 --> 01:22:28,830
But Abraxas can't go it alone.
He needs our support now.

1178
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:31,004
If U.S. Military assistance
is guaranteed...

1179
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:34,640
...Abraxas and his forces will
launch an attack on the government.

1180
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:39,074
They'll commandeer the radio stations
and the Canal Administration Office.

1181
01:22:39,281 --> 01:22:41,875
Subject, of course,
to advance payment...

1182
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:44,415
...for arms, equipment
and medical supplies.

1183
01:22:45,654 --> 01:22:46,781
How much?

1184
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:51,087
The sort of money you boys
leave under the plate, Elliot.

1185
01:22:52,194 --> 01:22:55,595
- How much?
- Twenty million dollars.

1186
01:22:59,068 --> 01:23:01,866
Elliot, may I say a couple
of words, please?

1187
01:23:03,773 --> 01:23:06,003
I'm only a rookie at heart.

1188
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:10,836
I don't know too much about the ins
and outs of politics, but I know this:

1189
01:23:11,078 --> 01:23:15,515
I was the last American
commander in Panama.

1190
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:19,486
I had the task of taking
our men out of there.

1191
01:23:21,055 --> 01:23:23,216
Only retreat of my career.

1192
01:23:27,027 --> 01:23:28,689
Broke my heart.

1193
01:23:31,866 --> 01:23:35,825
There is a missing star
on our flag, gentlemen.

1194
01:23:37,472 --> 01:23:41,670
Looks to me that God has
given us a second chance here.

1195
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:47,008
Yes?

1196
01:23:49,484 --> 01:23:50,644
Sir.

1197
01:23:55,223 --> 01:23:56,690
Encrypted.

1198
01:23:57,559 --> 01:23:59,823
It went over like ninepins.

1199
01:24:00,028 --> 01:24:01,996
Asked for 20 and guess what?

1200
01:24:02,197 --> 01:24:04,495
They beat me down to 15.

1201
01:24:04,699 --> 01:24:06,132
I'm on my way.

1202
01:24:06,334 --> 01:24:07,767
Press play, Andy.

1203
01:24:09,304 --> 01:24:11,205
Teddy! Teddy!

1204
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,499
Why are you hassling Mickie and Marta?

1205
01:24:13,743 --> 01:24:15,836
What are they up to this time, Harry?

1206
01:24:16,045 --> 01:24:19,446
What are you up to?
Spin me one of your stories.

1207
01:24:19,649 --> 01:24:21,446
You stay away from them or else.

1208
01:24:21,651 --> 01:24:24,586
How could you fuck
that faceless half-breed?

1209
01:24:28,624 --> 01:24:29,921
No, no. Relax.

1210
01:24:30,126 --> 01:24:32,356
You're a disgrace to that suit, Teddy.

1211
01:24:33,863 --> 01:24:35,694
- Hey.
- Louisa.

1212
01:24:38,134 --> 01:24:40,500
- There's something I must tell you.
- Okay.

1213
01:24:40,803 --> 01:24:41,895
Lou.

1214
01:24:42,138 --> 01:24:44,936
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

1215
01:24:46,676 --> 01:24:47,870
Hello?

1216
01:24:49,111 --> 01:24:50,544
Marta?

1217
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:54,410
Yeah, it's Louisa. I can't hear you.

1218
01:24:58,155 --> 01:25:00,055
I'll get... Okay.

1219
01:25:00,991 --> 01:25:02,083
It's for you.

1220
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:11,862
It's me.

1221
01:25:12,669 --> 01:25:16,196
<i>Oh, Harry. I need you. Please come.</i>

1222
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:21,739
<i>It's Mickie. He...</i>

1223
01:25:23,747 --> 01:25:24,941
Marta?

1224
01:25:31,455 --> 01:25:33,753
- I've gotta go.
- So it's Marta?

1225
01:25:33,957 --> 01:25:36,984
- All this time, under my nose.
- No, you don't understand.

1226
01:25:37,195 --> 01:25:39,561
Oh, come on, Harry. Please.

1227
01:25:40,098 --> 01:25:41,224
Be a man.

1228
01:25:41,566 --> 01:25:44,433
- Well, if you love her, go.
- Yes, I do love her.

1229
01:25:46,437 --> 01:25:48,496
But I've never made love to her.

1230
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:50,298
Get out.

1231
01:25:51,242 --> 01:25:52,869
Get out!

1232
01:25:55,913 --> 01:25:57,175
Harry.

1233
01:25:59,584 --> 01:26:00,642
Harry!

1234
01:26:14,132 --> 01:26:15,963
Oh, shit!

1235
01:26:49,535 --> 01:26:52,265
Washington has agreed
that as we have the contacts...

1236
01:26:52,471 --> 01:26:55,736
...that we should undertake
the financing and arming...

1237
01:26:55,974 --> 01:26:57,839
...of the Silent Opposition.

1238
01:26:58,043 --> 01:27:01,639
And it's been agreed that that task
be undertaken by an older hand.

1239
01:27:01,881 --> 01:27:06,409
By myself, in fact. And on
a more formal basis than hitherto.

1240
01:27:07,053 --> 01:27:10,318
I dare say that'll come
as a bit of a relief to you, Andrew.

1241
01:27:10,523 --> 01:27:12,718
Equipping an army, tedious business.

1242
01:27:12,926 --> 01:27:15,918
Not the sort of task
for your mercurial brain.

1243
01:27:16,129 --> 01:27:18,757
Best left to us humble
planners and plodders, eh?

1244
01:27:19,465 --> 01:27:23,832
It's fine in principle, Scotty.
Just one snag.

1245
01:27:24,135 --> 01:27:25,966
They won't talk to anyone but me.

1246
01:27:27,805 --> 01:27:30,273
I think you'll find that,
however shy they are...

1247
01:27:30,508 --> 01:27:32,601
...they'll talk to a candid friend...

1248
01:27:32,844 --> 01:27:35,312
...who has $15 million
to spend on them.

1249
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,707
Wouldn't you say, ambassador?

1250
01:27:38,516 --> 01:27:41,610
You know, for quite a while
I was skeptical...

1251
01:27:41,819 --> 01:27:45,085
...about this extraordinarily
silent opposition.

1252
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:50,318
And I always thought that Mickie
Abraxas was just a harmless drunk.

1253
01:27:50,796 --> 01:27:52,957
Funny how wrong you can be.

1254
01:27:54,466 --> 01:27:59,199
Andy may have a real problem conjuring
up one of these people for you.

1255
01:27:59,638 --> 01:28:02,971
Afraid so, Scotty.
You could put it like this:

1256
01:28:03,208 --> 01:28:07,110
If you don't go through me,
there is no Silent Opposition.

1257
01:28:07,312 --> 01:28:09,507
It doesn't do to be too possessive.

1258
01:28:09,715 --> 01:28:13,344
We must be brave and wean them off
the Osnard teat, my boy.

1259
01:28:13,986 --> 01:28:18,389
Might I offer myself
as a go-between, so to speak...

1260
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:22,219
...to verify Andy's dispersal
of these funds?

1261
01:28:22,828 --> 01:28:25,525
Kind of you to offer, ambassador.
Perhaps so.

1262
01:28:25,732 --> 01:28:28,633
Meanwhile, Andrew can brief me
on the details.

1263
01:28:28,835 --> 01:28:30,769
We have a lot to catch up on, eh?

1264
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:34,133
Whiskey till the small hours
in the privacy of your abode...

1265
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:37,275
...is indicated for Osnard
and Luxmore, I believe.

1266
01:28:39,245 --> 01:28:41,270
- Sure.
- Excellent, gentlemen.

1267
01:28:41,514 --> 01:28:44,745
Andrew, I take it you have
a secure safe in your apartment?

1268
01:28:44,951 --> 01:28:46,441
Absolutely, sir.

1269
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:47,811
Fort Knox.

1270
01:28:48,021 --> 01:28:49,318
Ambassador.

1271
01:28:49,756 --> 01:28:51,121
I'll get my files.

1272
01:29:01,301 --> 01:29:04,464
- You are getting out, aren't you?
- Possibly.

1273
01:29:05,638 --> 01:29:07,368
Too early to say.

1274
01:29:07,841 --> 01:29:09,308
You'll have to, won't you?

1275
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:12,411
I mean, there is no
Silent Opposition, is there?

1276
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:16,449
- Who told you that?
- You did, just now in the meeting.

1277
01:29:17,751 --> 01:29:19,776
You made it all up, didn't you?

1278
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:23,887
What are you talking about?

1279
01:29:24,091 --> 01:29:27,322
I think you're the wickedest
human being I've ever met.

1280
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:32,792
That was the attraction, wasn't it?

1281
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:35,730
How about a farewell fuck?

1282
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:37,762
Here in the office.

1283
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:39,929
A knee-trembler.

1284
01:29:43,377 --> 01:29:45,777
You know, I think I'm cured.

1285
01:29:47,214 --> 01:29:51,015
Excuse me, Francesca.
A private word with Andrew.

1286
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:53,010
He's all yours.

1287
01:29:55,890 --> 01:30:00,020
My duty is to inform
the Foreign Office of this...

1288
01:30:00,295 --> 01:30:01,694
...travesty.

1289
01:30:03,164 --> 01:30:04,756
How much is your duty worth?

1290
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,462
- Two million.
- One.

1291
01:30:07,669 --> 01:30:09,193
- One and a half.
- One and a quarter.

1292
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:10,598
Done.

1293
01:30:11,373 --> 01:30:12,670
Andrew.

1294
01:30:13,141 --> 01:30:14,472
Good night.

1295
01:30:42,538 --> 01:30:46,941
You got a lovely little family, Harry.
Only one thing can spoil it.

1296
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:50,010
- What's that, Uncle Benny?
- The truth, Harry.

1297
01:30:50,212 --> 01:30:51,645
That's the honest truth.

1298
01:30:59,889 --> 01:31:01,413
Esmeralda?

1299
01:31:02,224 --> 01:31:03,213
Esmeralda.

1300
01:31:05,928 --> 01:31:08,488
I'm going out. Watch the children.

1301
01:31:09,632 --> 01:31:11,293
Marta!

1302
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:18,635
Marta!

1303
01:31:32,756 --> 01:31:34,949
Oh, God!

1304
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:37,558
I'm not imposing on you, am I?

1305
01:31:37,759 --> 01:31:40,193
You're not imposing
on me in the least.

1306
01:31:43,364 --> 01:31:44,592
Who the devil's that?

1307
01:31:53,108 --> 01:31:54,598
Buchan 2. We got trouble.

1308
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:57,506
When I get her into
the other room, get out.

1309
01:31:57,746 --> 01:32:00,044
In the lobby,
give the concierge a dollar.

1310
01:32:00,249 --> 01:32:03,377
He'll get you a taxi to
the El Panama Hotel. Get a room.

1311
01:32:03,586 --> 01:32:05,315
A taxi? At this time of night?

1312
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:08,354
I don't speak Spanish, Andy.
I'm unarmed.

1313
01:32:08,557 --> 01:32:10,115
Life is cheap here.

1314
01:32:10,326 --> 01:32:13,523
You can handle it.
You're a field man, aren't you?

1315
01:32:14,330 --> 01:32:15,729
What about the bags?

1316
01:32:15,931 --> 01:32:18,593
I'll guard them with my life.
Believe me.

1317
01:32:44,427 --> 01:32:45,724
Louisa.

1318
01:32:46,897 --> 01:32:50,355
- Something on your mind?
- What the fuck have you done?

1319
01:32:50,667 --> 01:32:54,364
What is all this bullshit
about Abraxas and Delgado?

1320
01:32:54,571 --> 01:32:57,540
Don't worry. It's nothing.
It's crap. It's all a game.

1321
01:32:57,741 --> 01:32:59,368
- Where's Harry?
- Harry's okay.

1322
01:32:59,576 --> 01:33:03,376
- I'm gonna take care of Harry and you.
- Get your fucking hands off me!

1323
01:33:03,613 --> 01:33:05,342
Get off me.

1324
01:33:08,952 --> 01:33:10,419
Relax.

1325
01:33:11,121 --> 01:33:13,316
We both know why you're here.

1326
01:33:18,628 --> 01:33:19,890
Yeah.

1327
01:33:20,197 --> 01:33:22,758
Shit! You...

1328
01:33:26,971 --> 01:33:29,303
What have you gotten Harry into?

1329
01:33:29,507 --> 01:33:33,307
Harry got himself into this
with his own ludicrous stories.

1330
01:33:33,744 --> 01:33:38,044
When the Americans take back their
canal, it'll be down to him, not me.

1331
01:33:39,217 --> 01:33:40,206
When?

1332
01:33:41,352 --> 01:33:42,319
When?

1333
01:33:44,655 --> 01:33:46,452
Get out of my way!

1334
01:33:50,127 --> 01:33:51,856
I killed him, Marta.

1335
01:33:52,063 --> 01:33:54,531
I killed him with my bullshit.

1336
01:33:55,399 --> 01:33:57,697
He said the police were after him.

1337
01:33:57,902 --> 01:33:59,164
He said:

1338
01:34:00,771 --> 01:34:02,762
"Tell Harry I'm sorry."

1339
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:05,635
And I didn't finish his suit.

1340
01:34:06,478 --> 01:34:09,174
It would've given him
back his dignity.

1341
01:34:09,815 --> 01:34:11,874
He wouldn't have shot himself in it.

1342
01:34:12,117 --> 01:34:14,585
He was always going to do it.

1343
01:34:16,555 --> 01:34:19,752
He was just looking
for a good enough excuse.

1344
01:34:40,979 --> 01:34:42,879
Shall I close his eyes?

1345
01:34:55,662 --> 01:34:57,630
You must go now, Harry.

1346
01:34:58,998 --> 01:35:00,090
Go, Harry.

1347
01:35:22,555 --> 01:35:23,522
Yep.

1348
01:35:23,890 --> 01:35:25,881
Harry, my man, where have you been?

1349
01:35:26,092 --> 01:35:30,291
Louisa was here. I think she thought
I was leading you astray or something.

1350
01:35:33,334 --> 01:35:34,596
Jesus.

1351
01:35:35,669 --> 01:35:37,637
I see. Go on.

1352
01:35:38,138 --> 01:35:40,436
So we have to stop all this, you hear?

1353
01:35:40,974 --> 01:35:44,569
Mickie knew nothing about it.
You know and I know I made it all up.

1354
01:35:44,778 --> 01:35:47,872
<i>It's too late for that, old boy.
Out of our hands.</i>

1355
01:35:48,515 --> 01:35:51,107
A case of life imitating art.

1356
01:36:06,365 --> 01:36:08,128
Bit of a setback, sir.

1357
01:36:08,333 --> 01:36:10,359
It's Mickie Abraxas.

1358
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:12,428
Bullet through the head.

1359
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:14,497
Suicide.

1360
01:36:14,707 --> 01:36:17,904
Setback? Setback? On the contrary.

1361
01:36:18,111 --> 01:36:21,603
No, they'll probably claim
he killed himself in police custody.

1362
01:36:21,848 --> 01:36:25,841
That's standard euphemism for
assassinations in regimes of this ilk.

1363
01:36:26,085 --> 01:36:28,417
No, no one's going
to swallow that one.

1364
01:36:28,621 --> 01:36:29,588
<i>No.</i>

1365
01:36:30,256 --> 01:36:34,283
<i>"Leader of the Democratic Rebel
Movement murdered."</i>

1366
01:36:34,494 --> 01:36:38,430
<i>Yes. I think we could have
the peg we're looking for, Andy.</i>

1367
01:36:38,631 --> 01:36:41,532
<i>I'll inform our American cousins.
Now, tell me...</i>

1368
01:36:41,734 --> 01:36:44,931
<i>... did you manage to resolve
that Buchan 2 situation?</i>

1369
01:36:45,138 --> 01:36:49,370
<i>I got the distinct impression
she was in a state of high anxiety.</i>

1370
01:36:49,575 --> 01:36:54,411
<i>You must impress on your operatives
the importance of staying in control.</i>

1371
01:36:54,648 --> 01:36:55,706
<i>Andrew?</i>

1372
01:37:10,798 --> 01:37:13,824
Hello, is anybody there?
I must talk to the ambassador.

1373
01:37:14,034 --> 01:37:15,092
I'm English.

1374
01:37:15,302 --> 01:37:18,601
It's a matter of grave importance.

1375
01:37:25,379 --> 01:37:28,837
Mickie Abraxas died three hours ago.

1376
01:37:29,049 --> 01:37:32,109
Executed by a government death squad.

1377
01:37:32,753 --> 01:37:35,018
I have informed the president.

1378
01:37:35,223 --> 01:37:37,783
He has authorized us to go on in.

1379
01:37:37,992 --> 01:37:41,519
We have that right under the treaty
if the canal is threatened.

1380
01:37:42,330 --> 01:37:45,322
Operation Straight Arrow
is all yours, general.

1381
01:37:45,533 --> 01:37:47,296
How soon can you be operational?

1382
01:37:47,502 --> 01:37:50,596
- Give me four hours, sir.
- That fast?

1383
01:37:51,039 --> 01:37:54,805
My rapid response units
are on full alert, sir.

1384
01:37:55,009 --> 01:37:58,103
<i>Carrier Alaska is
off the coast of Panama.</i>

1385
01:37:58,313 --> 01:38:01,180
Eight F-22 Raptors are on alert.

1386
01:38:01,416 --> 01:38:04,908
Twelve gunships.
A battalion of marines.

1387
01:38:06,421 --> 01:38:09,720
- I've got to speak to the ambassador.
- The ambassador is busy.

1388
01:38:09,924 --> 01:38:11,824
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

1389
01:38:12,026 --> 01:38:13,516
Ambassador.

1390
01:38:14,028 --> 01:38:15,928
I am Buchan.

1391
01:38:16,231 --> 01:38:20,794
I made it all up. You've got
to stop it. You see, I'm Buchan.

1392
01:38:21,003 --> 01:38:23,972
I'm sorry, but aren't you
that tailor fellow?

1393
01:38:24,173 --> 01:38:25,504
You're rather upset.

1394
01:38:25,708 --> 01:38:28,575
- Nigel, please show the gentleman out.
- Yes.

1395
01:38:28,777 --> 01:38:31,473
There is no Silent Opposition!

1396
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:34,615
Someone's gotta blow the whistle.
Might as well be me.

1397
01:38:34,850 --> 01:38:38,809
You're a diplomat. Be diplomatic.
Can't interfere at this stage.

1398
01:38:39,054 --> 01:38:41,921
It would reflect very badly.
And what could we say?

1399
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:47,061
That some deranged tailor Johnny
told us it was all a joke?

1400
01:38:47,263 --> 01:38:48,287
Nevertheless.

1401
01:38:54,236 --> 01:38:56,898
- Darling, what...?
- I need to talk to Ernesto.

1402
01:39:04,447 --> 01:39:05,277
Andy.

1403
01:39:14,524 --> 01:39:15,456
Andy!

1404
01:39:20,597 --> 01:39:21,689
Wait!

1405
01:39:34,344 --> 01:39:35,743
Oh, Harry.

1406
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:52,058
Well, if the ambassador's
been recalled...

1407
01:39:52,263 --> 01:39:54,663
...give me somebody
who hasn't been recalled.

1408
01:39:54,865 --> 01:39:57,993
His secretary, his butler, his...

1409
01:40:00,071 --> 01:40:01,698
Come with me, Louisa.

1410
01:40:02,771 --> 01:40:04,796
We're going to see the president.

1411
01:40:17,419 --> 01:40:18,886
Shit!

1412
01:40:23,525 --> 01:40:25,426
Oh, no, no, no.

1413
01:40:25,629 --> 01:40:28,063
Come on, come on, come on.

1414
01:41:10,341 --> 01:41:12,275
What the fuck do you want?

1415
01:41:12,476 --> 01:41:17,209
I want you to come back to the embassy
and tell them it's all a mistake!

1416
01:41:17,948 --> 01:41:21,440
Harry, I've got our money here.
Yours and mine.

1417
01:41:21,686 --> 01:41:24,450
I'm trying to get out
before they close the airport.

1418
01:41:24,689 --> 01:41:28,853
I'm going straight to Switzerland.
Open numbered accounts for both of us.

1419
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:31,754
You'll be a rich man.
Just give me a lift.

1420
01:41:31,962 --> 01:41:33,987
- We're going back.
- Get out of my way!

1421
01:41:34,198 --> 01:41:37,895
- Are you not listening to me?
- Don't be bloody annoying, Harry!

1422
01:41:39,804 --> 01:41:42,637
Shit! They're here.

1423
01:42:05,630 --> 01:42:06,688
Ambassador!

1424
01:42:08,667 --> 01:42:12,763
Will you vouch for me, my credentials?
I need to get on a plane.

1425
01:42:12,971 --> 01:42:15,565
You wish for this man to be included?

1426
01:42:15,774 --> 01:42:17,742
I've never seen him before.

1427
01:42:19,978 --> 01:42:21,343
Ambassador.

1428
01:42:25,484 --> 01:42:29,545
As you can see, the airport is closed,
but palms have been greased.

1429
01:42:29,788 --> 01:42:34,692
And once our arrangement
has been concluded...

1430
01:42:35,261 --> 01:42:37,229
...you'll be free to go.

1431
01:42:52,779 --> 01:42:57,239
It is a fabrication, Mr. President.
A pack of lies, a travesty.

1432
01:42:57,450 --> 01:43:01,682
The canal is safe, secure.
Unthreatened.

1433
01:43:01,921 --> 01:43:03,889
Call off your dogs, sir.

1434
01:43:04,123 --> 01:43:05,750
Call them off.

1435
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:13,490
I'll walk you to your plane.

1436
01:43:17,037 --> 01:43:20,006
Could this be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship?

1437
01:43:20,207 --> 01:43:22,869
I think it desperately unlikely.

1438
01:43:27,447 --> 01:43:30,678
<i>Mission aborted. Return to base.</i>

1439
01:43:43,764 --> 01:43:44,890
Why?

1440
01:43:45,566 --> 01:43:47,124
I don't know.

1441
01:43:48,869 --> 01:43:50,496
I thought it was a game.

1442
01:43:50,704 --> 01:43:52,638
And behind my back?

1443
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:55,708
All those lies about
the president and Delgado?

1444
01:43:56,177 --> 01:43:58,611
Oh, yes, the lies.

1445
01:43:59,581 --> 01:44:02,448
I'm very, very sorry about the lies.

1446
01:44:06,521 --> 01:44:07,783
Louisa...

1447
01:44:08,556 --> 01:44:11,218
I never did work in Savile Row, did I?

1448
01:44:11,459 --> 01:44:12,926
Not as such.

1449
01:44:13,795 --> 01:44:16,093
I learned the tailoring in prison.

1450
01:44:16,762 --> 01:44:20,163
I burnt down my Uncle Benny's
warehouse to help him out.

1451
01:44:20,366 --> 01:44:22,391
And then, when I'd done my time...

1452
01:44:22,969 --> 01:44:25,836
...Uncle Benny,
he gives me my portion...

1453
01:44:26,806 --> 01:44:29,570
...sends me out here
so I can't get into trouble.

1454
01:44:30,843 --> 01:44:33,311
I pretended he was Arthur Braithwaite.

1455
01:44:38,785 --> 01:44:41,413
You see, lying's what
you do in prison, Lou.

1456
01:44:42,389 --> 01:44:44,448
It's instead of love, really.

1457
01:44:44,892 --> 01:44:48,623
You tell it the way it should be
since that's better than how it is...

1458
01:44:48,829 --> 01:44:50,262
...when it's that bad.

1459
01:44:50,497 --> 01:44:51,964
If you follow me.

1460
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:55,596
Why didn't you just tell me
from the start?

1461
01:44:58,338 --> 01:45:01,603
Because I fell in love
with you, my princess.

1462
01:45:04,311 --> 01:45:07,144
And I knew that I wasn't
good enough for you.

1463
01:45:08,682 --> 01:45:10,240
Not as I stood.

1464
01:45:12,886 --> 01:45:15,616
Harry, you are such a fool.

1465
01:45:17,791 --> 01:45:22,252
Dad, you promised to tell me a story.
Where were you?

1466
01:45:23,164 --> 01:45:24,631
Oh, Sarah.

1467
01:45:25,533 --> 01:45:27,091
I'm so sorry.

1468
01:45:29,871 --> 01:45:32,635
No need to cry about it, Dad.

1469
01:45:33,875 --> 01:45:35,069
Hi, Dad.

1470
01:45:35,276 --> 01:45:36,504
Hi, Mum.

1471
01:45:40,148 --> 01:45:42,207
So, what do you want me to do?

1472
01:45:44,552 --> 01:45:46,417
What do I want you to do?

1473
01:45:47,889 --> 01:45:49,481
What you always do.

1474
01:45:54,162 --> 01:45:55,652
Make breakfast.

1475
01:45:59,033 --> 01:46:01,126
Can we have pancakes?

1476
01:46:03,038 --> 01:46:05,063
- Yeah.
- You want pancakes?

1477
01:46:05,741 --> 01:46:07,072
Breakfast?

1478
01:46:19,355 --> 01:46:23,314
Well, there's two ways we can deal
with this one, my dear.

1479
01:46:23,525 --> 01:46:24,514
Ready?
