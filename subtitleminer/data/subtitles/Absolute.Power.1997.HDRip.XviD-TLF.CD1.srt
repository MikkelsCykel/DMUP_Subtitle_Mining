1
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,952
Don't give up.

2
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,489
Oh, I never do.

3
00:01:58,526 --> 00:01:59,760
May I?

4
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:13,540
Your work with your hands, don't you?

5
00:02:27,152 --> 00:02:29,120
- Hey, Red.
- Luther.

6
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:43,167
Your life would be a lot simpler
if you could learn to operate a VCR.

7
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:44,535
True.

8
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:46,837
Truer words were never spoken.

9
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:05,898
Let's see.

10
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:10,669
Here we go.

11
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:20,311
That's nice.

12
00:13:33,424 --> 00:13:35,858
It's okay, he's not here.

13
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:37,894
Anyway, I told him that...

14
00:13:38,094 --> 00:13:39,562
...I was sick...

15
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,565
...so you can relax.

16
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,075
Cheers.

17
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:08,922
I'll be right back.

18
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,768
You like that, huh?

19
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:50,702
Oh, yeah.

20
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:58,230
So, you want to play, huh?

21
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,274
You okay?

22
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,581
How'd you like that?

23
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:20,250
- You slap me?
- Don't slap me.

24
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,651
Little bitch.

25
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,520
Alan, what are you doing?

26
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:24,921
Alan!

27
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,490
Stop it.

28
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,460
Alan, you're hurting me.

29
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:33,095
I'll hurt you good.

30
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:40,635
You're hurting me.

31
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:41,836
Goddamn you!

32
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:43,271
You want to be hurt?

33
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:44,639
I'll hurt you.

34
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:50,477
- Let go!
- Do you?

35
00:18:50,644 --> 00:18:51,779
You like that?

36
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:55,616
God damn you.

37
00:18:57,885 --> 00:18:59,185
- Get away.
- Fucking bitch.

38
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:01,320
- Get away.
- Get back here.

39
00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:04,657
Get back here!

40
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:07,193
Stop it!

41
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:08,895
Stop it.

42
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:11,563
What are you doing?

43
00:19:16,234 --> 00:19:17,035
Bitch.

44
00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:25,643
You bitch.

45
00:19:25,843 --> 00:19:28,045
Want to play? I'll show you how.

46
00:19:28,245 --> 00:19:29,613
You fucking bastard.

47
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:33,049
You bastard.

48
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,488
You like that?

49
00:19:42,225 --> 00:19:43,492
Come back here.

50
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:44,827
Let go of me!

51
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:20,659
You bitch, you cut me...

52
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,927
...Goddamn it.

53
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:23,729
Fucking asshole.

54
00:20:23,963 --> 00:20:25,430
- I'll kill you.
- Bitch.

55
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:28,299
Help!

56
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:39,777
Help!

57
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,764
Did you kill her?

58
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:06,301
No choice in the matter, sir.

59
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:09,804
What am I going to do?

60
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:15,509
Jesus, Tim, what did we do?

61
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,578
No choice in the matter.

62
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,151
What the hell was that?

63
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:29,289
Oh, shit.

64
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,225
My God.

65
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:39,932
Oh, my God.

66
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:43,301
Jesus.

67
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:51,442
Do you realize what
a shit storm we're in?

68
00:21:55,979 --> 00:21:57,514
Come on, tell me.

69
00:21:57,714 --> 00:22:00,350
Nothing to tell. He screamed for help.

70
00:22:01,551 --> 00:22:04,387
You heard no sounds
of violence till then?

71
00:22:04,653 --> 00:22:06,622
Nothing we haven't heard before.

72
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,499
- Maybe I should call the police now.
- Jesus.

73
00:22:17,665 --> 00:22:18,566
What?

74
00:22:20,468 --> 00:22:21,403
Bill?

75
00:22:22,003 --> 00:22:24,138
Why don't you think about that.

76
00:22:24,338 --> 00:22:26,173
Just take a second...

77
00:22:26,673 --> 00:22:28,409
...and think about that.

78
00:22:31,345 --> 00:22:32,880
Think real...

79
00:22:33,247 --> 00:22:34,548
...fucking...

80
00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:36,215
...hard.

81
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,254
It's...

82
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:44,490
...probably not a good idea.

83
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:04,875
Here's what happened.

84
00:23:06,877 --> 00:23:08,511
Poor Christy...

85
00:23:08,712 --> 00:23:10,246
...came home alone...

86
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:12,382
...and interrupted a burglary.

87
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:14,017
Sound logical?

88
00:23:14,718 --> 00:23:15,819
Sure.

89
00:23:21,123 --> 00:23:23,358
We'll have to sanitize this place.

90
00:23:26,729 --> 00:23:28,363
Did you have sex with her?

91
00:23:28,963 --> 00:23:30,898
I don't know.

92
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:34,802
You'll have to examine her.

93
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:37,605
- I'm no gynecologist.
- I just made you one.

94
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:39,740
Christ.

95
00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:17,441
- I'll take that.
- Both their fingerprints are on it.

96
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:19,143
Thanks for sharing.

97
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:21,779
Gloria?

98
00:24:26,449 --> 00:24:29,352
- Did I kill her?
- Everything'll be fine. Come on...

99
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:31,788
...just don't worry about it.

100
00:24:31,954 --> 00:24:34,256
- Oh, God.
- Now be careful.

101
00:24:34,456 --> 00:24:36,425
Just don't get blood on you.

102
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:41,463
I'll take care of everything, okay?

103
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,098
Just like I always do.

104
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,012
- Shit!
- What?

105
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:02,782
Madame's purse.

106
00:25:19,497 --> 00:25:21,332
Miss Russell. Let me get him.

107
00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:22,700
Thank you.

108
00:25:37,514 --> 00:25:38,981
- I got him.
- Fine.

109
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:41,717
Nice and easy, sir.

110
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:57,786
My God!

111
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:04,792
No knife!

112
00:27:04,992 --> 00:27:06,461
- What?
- Where's the knife?

113
00:27:08,596 --> 00:27:09,831
In the bedroom.

114
00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:11,899
- Come on.
- Get up there.

115
00:28:37,077 --> 00:28:38,011
Shit.

116
00:28:38,178 --> 00:28:39,212
Shit.

117
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,237
Go!

118
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,877
Excuse me.

119
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:31,702
I got the number.

120
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,876
Gee, guys, maybe it was the bogey man.

121
00:31:40,843 --> 00:31:44,313
Don't forget to check under the bed.
You may have buried us.

122
00:31:44,514 --> 00:31:46,148
I got his license, remember?

123
00:31:46,348 --> 00:31:48,984
You think he'll sit around
waiting for us, asshole?

124
00:31:49,184 --> 00:31:50,585
Take it easy, Miss Russell.

125
00:31:50,752 --> 00:31:53,055
Everybody shut up, all right?

126
00:32:01,195 --> 00:32:02,396
What have you got?

127
00:32:04,098 --> 00:32:05,433
Oh, boy.

128
00:32:09,736 --> 00:32:11,071
Okay, Tim.

129
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:27,953
Two-way mirror.

130
00:32:28,953 --> 00:32:31,422
We better get cracking
on that license number.

131
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:33,891
That's all we've got.

132
00:32:34,392 --> 00:32:36,227
He's got the letter opener.

133
00:32:36,728 --> 00:32:37,762
Blood.

134
00:32:38,296 --> 00:32:39,763
Fingerprints.

135
00:32:41,465 --> 00:32:42,599
Jesus...

136
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,568
...think what he can do.

137
00:32:44,968 --> 00:32:46,436
The man's a thief.

138
00:32:46,636 --> 00:32:48,705
A thief who witnessed a murder.

139
00:32:49,573 --> 00:32:52,108
It looks like he stole
a bunch of money.

140
00:32:54,643 --> 00:32:56,579
I'll tell you what he'll do.

141
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,415
He'll run like hell.

142
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,294
They beat us by seven.

143
00:33:14,928 --> 00:33:16,296
By seven.

144
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:19,900
Who'd have thought that.

145
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,211
Kate.

146
00:34:27,095 --> 00:34:29,596
It'd be a little late for me,
wouldn't it?

147
00:34:30,263 --> 00:34:31,732
The jogging, I mean.

148
00:34:36,269 --> 00:34:38,404
Kind of dumb way to start, isn't it?

149
00:34:38,604 --> 00:34:40,072
But I did...

150
00:34:40,439 --> 00:34:41,741
...want to talk to you.

151
00:34:41,941 --> 00:34:43,209
About?

152
00:34:45,544 --> 00:34:47,013
About the weather, actually.

153
00:34:47,213 --> 00:34:49,547
Getting kind of cool in the evenings.

154
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:52,384
That happens this time of year.

155
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,254
I was thinking of...

156
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:59,957
...moving to a kinder,
more gentle climate.

157
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,526
I thought I'd talk it over with you...

158
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,762
...since you're my only family.

159
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,698
Luther, you don't have me.

160
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:14,270
I was the only kid at show-and-tell
who got to talk about visiting day.

161
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,710
This move, it would be a...

162
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,644
...permanent one, you understand?

163
00:35:24,646 --> 00:35:26,715
We never see each other anyway.

164
00:35:26,915 --> 00:35:29,685
I haven't seen you since Mom died.
That's a year.

165
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,155
Look...

166
00:35:34,655 --> 00:35:36,824
...you had a right to choose your life.

167
00:35:36,991 --> 00:35:38,326
You were never around.

168
00:35:38,492 --> 00:35:39,460
Fine.

169
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,796
I have no plans to be around for you.

170
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:47,834
Wait a minute. Wait.

171
00:35:49,002 --> 00:35:50,704
You're lying, aren't you?

172
00:35:52,372 --> 00:35:55,841
Are you active again?
Is that why you're here now?

173
00:35:59,511 --> 00:36:01,146
I don't believe you.

174
00:36:04,116 --> 00:36:06,351
Oh, Christ.

175
00:36:06,517 --> 00:36:08,419
Father, what have you done?

176
00:36:25,802 --> 00:36:27,003
Christy Sullivan?

177
00:36:27,203 --> 00:36:31,641
Wife of Walter. Most likely came home
and stumbled onto a burglary.

178
00:36:31,874 --> 00:36:33,342
Some burglary.

179
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:35,511
I wish my carpets were this clean.

180
00:36:35,711 --> 00:36:37,879
I couldn't find one decent fingerprint.

181
00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:41,182
- Are you serious, Laura?
- It's like Mary Poppins was here.

182
00:36:41,383 --> 00:36:42,617
Where's Mr. Sullivan?

183
00:36:42,817 --> 00:36:43,818
Sorry, Seth.

184
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:47,621
The entire Sullivan household
went to Barbados two days ago.

185
00:36:49,056 --> 00:36:50,524
Thanks for your support.

186
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:52,526
No, wait. It gets worse.

187
00:36:52,726 --> 00:36:54,495
The shots came from here.

188
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:56,297
If she stumbled on a burglary...

189
00:36:56,497 --> 00:37:00,333
...she'd have been here. But she
was killed exactly where she is.

190
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,535
The blood patterns indicate that.

191
00:37:03,736 --> 00:37:05,872
What's she doing here?

192
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:13,645
Looks like someone sat here,
but I couldn't find any prints.

193
00:37:16,014 --> 00:37:20,217
Think old man Sullivan hid in this
chair and watched his wife perform?

194
00:37:21,352 --> 00:37:23,154
Oh, God, I hope not.

195
00:37:23,587 --> 00:37:26,223
For his sake. He's such a great man.

196
00:37:27,525 --> 00:37:29,694
Be careful, now, digging that out.

197
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:31,728
Seems he tried to strangle her.

198
00:37:32,195 --> 00:37:35,265
Then he went to the door
to shoot her from behind?

199
00:37:36,366 --> 00:37:38,535
He also inspected her vagina.

200
00:37:41,204 --> 00:37:42,538
He did what?

201
00:37:42,771 --> 00:37:43,906
Why?

202
00:37:44,373 --> 00:37:46,709
Maybe he didn't remember he did her.

203
00:37:50,612 --> 00:37:53,448
A strong burglar with a weak mind.

204
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:56,351
Obviously, it's another
open-and-shut case.

205
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:24,130
Tomorrow's temperatures should climb
into the 70's, with lows around 50.

206
00:40:08,404 --> 00:40:09,872
Mr. Sullivan?

207
00:40:11,073 --> 00:40:12,408
Sorry to bother you.

208
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:15,877
Seth Frank, senior homicide detective
for Middleton County.

209
00:40:16,077 --> 00:40:19,014
My client's in no mood
for conversation, sir.

210
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,715
That's all right, Sandy.

211
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:23,351
You're in charge of the case,
Mr. Frank?

212
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:25,019
Yes, sir.

213
00:40:25,252 --> 00:40:27,488
I must ask you a few questions.

214
00:40:28,756 --> 00:40:30,124
What is it you want?

215
00:40:30,524 --> 00:40:32,660
Positive identification?

216
00:40:35,762 --> 00:40:37,497
That was my wife.

217
00:40:38,564 --> 00:40:39,766
Anything else?

218
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,435
You were in Barbados for two days?

219
00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:46,004
I took the staff.
Always do this time of year.

220
00:40:46,204 --> 00:40:48,006
Your wife didn't come with you?

221
00:40:48,206 --> 00:40:49,675
Well, she was.

222
00:40:50,442 --> 00:40:52,077
Had it all planned...

223
00:40:52,444 --> 00:40:53,912
...but you know women.

224
00:40:54,613 --> 00:40:56,414
She changed her mind.

225
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:02,086
I had been married to my Rebecca
for 47 years.

226
00:41:03,621 --> 00:41:05,189
When she died...

227
00:41:06,123 --> 00:41:09,292
...I decided I never wanted
that pain again.

228
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:13,196
One thing I knew about Christy:

229
00:41:13,964 --> 00:41:16,032
She was going to outlive me.

230
00:41:16,399 --> 00:41:18,934
I think that's enough for today.

231
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:22,071
Sir, I have to ask you about the vault.

232
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:26,642
You mean the contents
of the vault, of course.

233
00:41:31,312 --> 00:41:32,981
- Sandy, you go on.
- Walter?

234
00:41:33,147 --> 00:41:35,116
No, really, I'm all right.

235
00:41:35,316 --> 00:41:36,784
You go on to the reception.

236
00:41:38,252 --> 00:41:40,087
Obviously I can't make it.

237
00:41:40,253 --> 00:41:42,289
I'm sure everyone will understand.

238
00:41:43,991 --> 00:41:45,959
You don't mean the contents.

239
00:41:47,928 --> 00:41:49,396
You mean the chair.

240
00:41:51,297 --> 00:41:53,099
You must ask about the chair.

241
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,401
Yes, sir, I do.

242
00:41:55,768 --> 00:41:57,970
Why? Are they connected?

243
00:41:58,638 --> 00:42:02,507
Someone may have been sitting in it
and have been involved in the murder.

244
00:42:04,776 --> 00:42:09,147
You're a great man. I've the deepest
respect for you. I'm sorry to do this.

245
00:42:09,347 --> 00:42:12,316
I promise you none of this
will make my highlight reel.

246
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:16,086
Well, I hoped I could satisfy her...

247
00:42:16,687 --> 00:42:18,322
...but you know, she...

248
00:42:19,189 --> 00:42:21,258
...had needs and she...

249
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,793
...didn't want to go behind my back.

250
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:27,797
She suggested the chair.

251
00:42:28,197 --> 00:42:31,467
She hoped I might get
to like sitting there.

252
00:42:32,201 --> 00:42:33,535
I didn't.

253
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:39,608
For 80 years I've tried to live...

254
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:42,444
...a decent life.

255
00:42:42,878 --> 00:42:45,346
I've given a billion dollars
to charity.

256
00:42:45,546 --> 00:42:47,315
If this comes to trial...

257
00:42:47,715 --> 00:42:49,684
...none of that will be remembered.

258
00:42:50,885 --> 00:42:52,653
I'll just go out...

259
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,654
...the joke of the world.

260
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,856
I understand, sir.

261
00:42:57,057 --> 00:42:58,692
I'll do what I can.

262
00:42:58,892 --> 00:43:00,827
Will you listen to me whine?

263
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,963
I apologize...

264
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,564
...Mr. Frank.

265
00:43:05,331 --> 00:43:06,632
Just do your job, huh?

266
00:43:06,832 --> 00:43:09,168
- And I'll try to do mine.
- Yes, sir.

267
00:43:13,505 --> 00:43:15,140
I'm sorry, sir.

268
00:43:37,261 --> 00:43:38,561
General.

269
00:43:45,034 --> 00:43:46,435
Ladies and gentlemen...

270
00:43:46,602 --> 00:43:48,037
The President.

271
00:43:50,538 --> 00:43:51,740
Sandy.

272
00:43:52,374 --> 00:43:53,708
Mister President.

273
00:43:55,777 --> 00:43:58,380
- Take a walk with me.
- Certainly, sir.

274
00:44:00,714 --> 00:44:02,783
Tell me about Walter. How is he?

275
00:44:03,117 --> 00:44:06,553
Well, he's 80 and alone, Mr. President.

276
00:44:06,787 --> 00:44:09,757
He understands that, officially,
my hands are tied.

277
00:44:09,957 --> 00:44:12,792
But he's very moved
by your concern, sir.

278
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:16,029
- Any news of the killer?
- No.

279
00:44:16,396 --> 00:44:18,865
Why isn't there? Who's in charge?

280
00:44:19,065 --> 00:44:20,366
Top man.

281
00:44:20,566 --> 00:44:23,268
He spent eight years,
homicide work in New York.

282
00:44:23,635 --> 00:44:27,072
I understand how you feel.
It's hard to be patient.

283
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:29,474
No one understands how I feel.

284
00:44:30,075 --> 00:44:32,109
I'm supposed to have all this power...

285
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,046
...and I can't even help
my oldest friend.

286
00:44:35,746 --> 00:44:38,316
You and I know,
more than any man alive...

287
00:44:38,482 --> 00:44:40,284
...Walter Sullivan put me here.

288
00:44:41,485 --> 00:44:43,453
And now when he needs me most...

289
00:44:44,254 --> 00:44:46,289
...well, he must feel abandoned.

290
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:54,330
I'll have a press conference.

291
00:44:54,496 --> 00:44:55,831
I'll have Walter come.

292
00:44:55,998 --> 00:44:58,467
I'll embrace him in front of the world.

293
00:45:00,102 --> 00:45:02,037
He'll treasure that, Mr. President.

294
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:05,840
What a generous gesture.

295
00:45:07,108 --> 00:45:09,243
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

296
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:18,819
Tennis elbow.

297
00:45:27,526 --> 00:45:29,762
This thing is getting worse, Gloria.

298
00:45:29,962 --> 00:45:31,631
I need to see a doctor.

299
00:45:31,797 --> 00:45:34,834
The country would have
to be informed, Mr. President.

300
00:45:35,534 --> 00:45:37,969
What happened to my rights to privacy?

301
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:40,338
I think she nicked a tendon.

302
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,675
Burton says it's a flesh wound.

303
00:45:45,644 --> 00:45:48,112
Since when did you become
an expert, Bill?

304
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:50,281
You ever been wounded?

305
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,182
Yes, sir. A few times.

306
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,189
Are you serious about
this press conference?

307
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,824
Of course I am.

308
00:46:02,325 --> 00:46:04,294
Walter's like a father to me.

309
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,497
Shall I bring Mrs. Richmond
home for it?

310
00:46:08,331 --> 00:46:10,866
I don't think Mrs. Richmond's
mission...

311
00:46:11,066 --> 00:46:13,835
...to help the poor in Asia
needs to be interrupted.

312
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,005
What do we know so far?

313
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,808
We've checked his license plates.

314
00:46:21,008 --> 00:46:23,945
He stole the car from
a police impoundment lot.

315
00:46:25,313 --> 00:46:28,015
We're not dealing with
a fool here, are we?

316
00:46:28,382 --> 00:46:30,184
Has he initiated contact?

317
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:32,819
Burton doesn't think he will.

318
00:46:34,854 --> 00:46:36,189
I agree.

319
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:39,492
I apologize. This won't happen again.

320
00:46:39,693 --> 00:46:40,994
Consider it a blip...

321
00:46:41,193 --> 00:46:42,995
...on the screen.

322
00:46:43,195 --> 00:46:44,763
That's all he is, too.

323
00:46:45,598 --> 00:46:48,067
He could be a little more than that.

324
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:49,702
He saw.

325
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:54,239
He saw nothing but a drunk woman
who liked rough sex too much.

326
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:55,673
He's a burglar.

327
00:46:55,873 --> 00:46:57,075
Who'll believe him?

328
00:46:57,275 --> 00:47:00,211
It's not as if he has
any evidence or anything.

329
00:47:29,571 --> 00:47:31,706
He's a burglar. Who'll believe him?

330
00:47:32,073 --> 00:47:34,976
It's not as if he has
any evidence or anything.

331
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,540
Boy, you always did
disappear good, Luther.

332
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,977
You're trying to say
I have a weak face, right?

333
00:48:49,143 --> 00:48:51,044
I'm just saying you're lucky.

334
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:54,681
Some of my customers, no matter
what I do, still stand out.

335
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:56,717
How many passports you want?

336
00:48:57,384 --> 00:48:59,019
Four should do the trick.

337
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:02,521
Different looks, matching
international driver's licenses.

338
00:49:02,722 --> 00:49:05,291
Since it's you I'll throw in
some dummy credit cards.

339
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:08,461
How are the rugs I made you holding up?

340
00:49:08,628 --> 00:49:11,430
Good. The mustaches
and the beards also.

341
00:49:11,697 --> 00:49:14,332
We try to give quality for our money.

342
00:49:15,066 --> 00:49:17,469
You leaving the country for permanent?

343
00:49:18,336 --> 00:49:19,738
That could be, yeah.

344
00:49:21,072 --> 00:49:24,008
Does it matter where you've been?
I hate doing...

345
00:49:24,174 --> 00:49:25,809
...those Asian passport stamps.

346
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:29,480
Make it European and the Caribbean
in the winter and...

347
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,548
How long will all this take?

348
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:35,485
It usually takes some time.
For you I'll rush it.

349
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,155
You were always very dependable.

350
00:49:39,689 --> 00:49:41,224
Listen, Luther.

351
00:49:41,824 --> 00:49:45,594
I don't want to know what you're into.
I do, but I won't ask.

352
00:49:45,761 --> 00:49:47,896
But leaving the country forever...

353
00:49:48,864 --> 00:49:50,165
What is it?

354
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:52,834
I just never figured you for a runner.

355
00:49:53,035 --> 00:49:56,804
Luther, 30% of my runners,
they kill themselves within five years.

356
00:49:59,707 --> 00:50:02,710
Right now, five years
doesn't sound too bad.

357
00:50:04,111 --> 00:50:05,346
Take care.

358
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:08,214
See you.

359
00:50:09,249 --> 00:50:11,418
Okay, see if this makes any sense.

360
00:50:11,851 --> 00:50:13,720
I am Christy Sullivan...

361
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:17,056
...I come in a bedroom
and I surprise a burglar.

362
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:22,094
Now, you're the burglar
coming out of the vault.

363
00:50:22,261 --> 00:50:24,263
Gold star. I draw my gun. Boom.

364
00:50:24,463 --> 00:50:27,299
Why bother to strangle her
when you could shoot?

365
00:50:27,466 --> 00:50:30,902
Why do I bother to strip her and
then put her clothes back on?

366
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,704
There I can help you out.

367
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:35,406
Before you were a burglar
you were a dry cleaner...

368
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,941
...and you love beautiful clothes.

369
00:50:37,141 --> 00:50:39,710
Thanks a lot.
And you dress her because...

370
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:44,114
She was a good customer and you didn't
want her to be embarrassed.

371
00:50:44,648 --> 00:50:48,452
She had a 0.21 blood alcohol level,
not that that makes any difference.

372
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:50,119
She didn't drive.

373
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,789
The chauffeurs, they keep
exact mileage on these cars.

374
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:56,959
They haven't been driven
since the clan left town.

375
00:50:57,159 --> 00:51:00,029
I checked every cab and limo service.
No one knows a thing.

376
00:51:00,096 --> 00:51:02,230
Somebody drove her home. Who?

377
00:51:02,831 --> 00:51:05,267
- Why haven't they come forward?
- Maybe...

378
00:51:05,433 --> 00:51:07,669
...because whoever drove her home
killed her.

379
00:51:10,205 --> 00:51:11,138
Maybe.

380
00:51:11,605 --> 00:51:13,140
I love this case.

381
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,642
Lieutenant?

382
00:51:14,842 --> 00:51:17,311
The problems you had with the phones?

383
00:51:17,778 --> 00:51:19,813
- Just took care of them.
- Thank you.

384
00:51:20,614 --> 00:51:22,248
Just part of the job.

385
00:51:22,849 --> 00:51:25,084
I hate people who say that.

386
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:27,086
It is your fucking job.

387
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,589
Remember the bullet hole in the wall?

388
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:31,124
Guess what?

389
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:32,258
No slug.

390
00:51:32,325 --> 00:51:36,194
Why take a slug out of the wall
when there's one stuck in her head?

391
00:51:36,361 --> 00:51:38,530
Different from the one in her body?

392
00:51:38,964 --> 00:51:41,934
Two different guns means two burglars.

393
00:51:42,301 --> 00:51:46,003
Two guys broke in? They both
went out the window? That's bullshit.

394
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:47,838
By the way...

395
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:52,510
...why he or they go out the window
in the first place, when he or they...

396
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:55,779
...got in by breaking
a zillion-dollar security system?

397
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:59,783
A Bill Burton from Secret Service
is in the parking lot.

398
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:03,453
Thanks. What's Secret Service
doing in the parking lot?

399
00:52:11,961 --> 00:52:13,662
Bill Burton. Hi.

400
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:16,297
Seth Frank.
To what do I owe the honor?

401
00:52:16,497 --> 00:52:21,302
I know you must be going crazy, but the
boss is interested about your progress.

402
00:52:21,502 --> 00:52:23,137
We could help each other out.

403
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:24,806
What do you have in mind?

404
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,841
You know how close he and Sullivan are.

405
00:52:28,008 --> 00:52:29,042
Right.

406
00:52:29,209 --> 00:52:30,310
Well.

407
00:52:31,178 --> 00:52:33,213
The minute anything breaks...

408
00:52:33,914 --> 00:52:36,049
...call me and I'll tell the president.

409
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:40,186
He'd be the first to alert Mr. Sullivan.
It'd mean a lot to him.

410
00:52:40,753 --> 00:52:43,222
And any red tape you want cut, done.

411
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:46,025
Here's my numbers.

412
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,493
Any leads?

413
00:52:49,094 --> 00:52:51,429
We're still trying to figure it out.

414
00:52:51,596 --> 00:52:54,799
- I loved playing Sherlock Holmes.
- Secret Service guys do that?

415
00:52:55,033 --> 00:52:57,769
I was a state trooper before
the government got me.

416
00:52:57,969 --> 00:52:59,937
Wait. You're that Bill Burton?

417
00:53:00,104 --> 00:53:01,539
I was younger and dumber then.

418
00:53:01,705 --> 00:53:04,308
I was younger.
I think I'm dumber now.

419
00:53:04,408 --> 00:53:05,376
Keep in touch.

420
00:53:32,033 --> 00:53:35,136
My chef makes them especially for me.

421
00:53:35,303 --> 00:53:38,005
I promise you, they're sinful.

422
00:53:38,973 --> 00:53:40,975
You're a salesman, Mr. Sullivan.

423
00:53:42,509 --> 00:53:44,477
This is a new arena for me...

424
00:53:45,512 --> 00:53:47,480
...but from what I'm told, you...

425
00:53:47,681 --> 00:53:49,316
...have a flawless reputation...

426
00:53:49,849 --> 00:53:52,752
...which is why I need
to employ you, Mr. McCarty.

427
00:53:52,918 --> 00:53:53,953
Understood.

428
00:53:54,186 --> 00:53:57,089
I don't know who it is I'm after yet.

429
00:53:57,256 --> 00:53:58,724
Until I do...

430
00:53:58,891 --> 00:54:01,660
...you'll have to wait in Washington
for instructions.

431
00:54:04,028 --> 00:54:05,997
I'm afraid that's out of the question.

432
00:54:07,265 --> 00:54:09,033
My work is not very creative...

433
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,903
...and I do it because I enjoy living
beyond my means.

434
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:14,205
I can't afford to just sit around.

435
00:54:16,273 --> 00:54:19,343
My father died when
I was ten years old.

436
00:54:19,543 --> 00:54:20,911
He was a miner.

437
00:54:21,111 --> 00:54:22,880
He died of lung disease.

438
00:54:23,614 --> 00:54:26,082
I became rich at 25.

439
00:54:26,282 --> 00:54:29,619
The first thing I did was buy
that mine, close it down...

440
00:54:29,785 --> 00:54:33,756
...and give every miner
$50,000 to retire on.

441
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:39,794
You will wait in Washington,
Mr. McCarty...

442
00:54:40,128 --> 00:54:41,596
...and I will put...

443
00:54:41,796 --> 00:54:44,266
...one million dollars expenses...

444
00:54:44,633 --> 00:54:46,867
...in a Swiss bank of your choosing...

445
00:54:47,067 --> 00:54:47,968
...and...

446
00:54:48,135 --> 00:54:49,603
...when the time comes...

447
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,239
...two million dollars a bullet.

448
00:54:54,642 --> 00:54:56,544
You are a salesman, sir.

449
00:54:59,245 --> 00:55:01,447
Selling sin is easy.

450
00:55:08,154 --> 00:55:10,389
- Who is he?
- That's Luther Whitney...

451
00:55:10,589 --> 00:55:12,991
...one of the world's great thieves.

452
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:16,495
I'm going nuts with this.
I was up all night.

453
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:21,232
I remembered your notion about
how maybe it was two burglars.

454
00:55:21,432 --> 00:55:22,900
Around dawn I thought:

455
00:55:23,067 --> 00:55:26,070
What if it's not two burglars
but what if it's one guy...

456
00:55:26,204 --> 00:55:28,573
...trying to throw us off
by making it look like two?

457
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,173
I called the FBI.

458
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,475
They keep track of this stuff.

459
00:55:32,642 --> 00:55:36,112
There's maybe six guys who
could have done the Sullivan job.

460
00:55:36,213 --> 00:55:37,614
I've traced all six...

461
00:55:38,014 --> 00:55:40,183
...only Whitney lives in Washington.

462
00:55:40,784 --> 00:55:42,418
Why's it I never heard of him?

463
00:55:42,618 --> 00:55:44,954
'Cause he hasn't been arrested
in 30 years.

464
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,923
What's this? His graduation picture
from Harvard?

465
00:55:48,123 --> 00:55:51,327
That's ancient history.
He was part of a gang.

466
00:55:51,527 --> 00:55:52,861
Three-time loser.

467
00:55:53,027 --> 00:55:54,829
Since he got out the last time...

468
00:55:55,296 --> 00:55:56,831
...no one's touched him.

469
00:55:58,032 --> 00:56:02,370
Anytime something big comes up
they question him, but it never sticks.

470
00:56:03,704 --> 00:56:05,439
We can make this stick.

471
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:11,078
I bet this is our guy. He's local.
You can't ask for anything more.

472
00:56:11,879 --> 00:56:13,679
Well, we got a problem.

473
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,947
What?

474
00:56:16,215 --> 00:56:18,417
He hasn't killed anyone in 45 years.

475
00:56:19,385 --> 00:56:20,520
Korea.

476
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,288
So what, he's a veteran.

477
00:56:22,488 --> 00:56:25,524
He's not just a veteran.
He's a wounded veteran.

478
00:56:25,824 --> 00:56:27,726
I got his war record here.

479
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:29,694
Battles, commendations...

480
00:56:29,895 --> 00:56:31,963
...decorations up the kazoo.

481
00:56:33,231 --> 00:56:35,199
He lives alone on his disability.

482
00:56:35,366 --> 00:56:37,835
That's what he says anyway. But...

483
00:56:38,402 --> 00:56:41,972
I don't see this guy as a killer.
He's just a great thief.

484
00:56:42,172 --> 00:56:44,575
Besides, I don't do war heroes.

485
00:57:31,283 --> 00:57:32,985
Well, you must be smart.

486
00:57:34,386 --> 00:57:35,588
Pardon me?

487
00:57:36,722 --> 00:57:39,591
Usually it takes you guys
a week to get to me.

488
00:57:43,895 --> 00:57:45,230
I recognize your picture...

489
00:57:45,396 --> 00:57:46,631
...from the newspaper.

490
00:57:49,734 --> 00:57:51,101
Nice to meet you.

491
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:56,707
Would you like a signed confession now,
or would you like to have coffee first?

492
00:57:56,907 --> 00:58:00,944
Before I send you away for life,
I should check out your alibi.

493
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,379
I was watching football...

494
00:58:03,579 --> 00:58:05,715
...with a friend, Red Bransford.

495
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,950
He owns a saloon here in town.

496
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:12,888
You can ask me about the game
if you like. I could be lying.

497
00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:15,724
You've been following the case?

498
00:58:15,924 --> 00:58:17,158
I have.

499
00:58:17,325 --> 00:58:19,294
I love true crime.

500
00:58:19,761 --> 00:58:24,398
FBI says only a few guys could handle
the Sullivan job. I got a list.

501
00:58:24,598 --> 00:58:25,900
You're on it.

502
00:58:26,433 --> 00:58:28,068
How I wish it were true.

503
00:58:30,337 --> 00:58:32,106
This person, they...

504
00:58:32,406 --> 00:58:37,243
...they go in the front door, then out
a window and down a rope at night?

505
00:58:37,777 --> 00:58:42,682
If I could do something like that I'd
be the star of my A.A.R.P. Meetings.

506
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:45,317
What, the American...?

507
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:48,187
Association of Retired Persons.

508
00:58:51,023 --> 00:58:53,325
Luther, why was this so difficult?

509
00:58:54,026 --> 00:58:56,661
You want me to help you
solve your case?

510
00:58:56,861 --> 00:58:58,596
Just looking for insight.

511
00:58:58,763 --> 00:58:59,997
How would you...

512
00:59:00,631 --> 00:59:03,334
Scratch that.
How would one go about it?

513
00:59:03,534 --> 00:59:06,002
What kind of person should I look for?

514
00:59:07,871 --> 00:59:11,107
Except for the rope trick,
an older person. Like me.

515
00:59:11,308 --> 00:59:12,642
Because?

516
00:59:13,543 --> 00:59:15,345
Well, you need patience.

517
00:59:15,512 --> 00:59:18,881
The secret is research.
At least I've read that.

518
00:59:19,048 --> 00:59:20,683
What kind of research?

519
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:26,121
From what I saw on the tube,
this is a rather large home.

520
00:59:26,322 --> 00:59:28,790
There must be an architectural office.

521
00:59:29,057 --> 00:59:32,527
You'd have to go to the library,
go through public records...

522
00:59:32,727 --> 00:59:36,631
...find out where that office is
and then you break in.

523
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:39,666
You xerox the plans and
get them back by morning.

524
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:41,502
Why not just steal them?

525
00:59:42,169 --> 00:59:44,705
Anyone can break in, but breaking in...

526
00:59:44,905 --> 00:59:48,141
...without people knowing it,
that's the trick.

527
00:59:48,308 --> 00:59:50,710
Then there's the general contractor...

528
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:53,346
...and there's the security company.

529
00:59:53,846 --> 00:59:58,251
Do you realize the skill in breaking
the security of a security company?

530
00:59:59,218 --> 01:00:01,520
I don't know how those guys do it.

531
01:00:03,355 --> 01:00:05,490
Why go to all that trouble?

532
01:00:06,591 --> 01:00:10,428
It's a large vault. There must be
a secret way into it.

533
01:00:10,595 --> 01:00:12,897
There was, that's what I don't get.

534
01:00:13,531 --> 01:00:14,698
How do you mean?

535
01:00:14,865 --> 01:00:18,269
This guy had obviously done
the research you're talking about.

536
01:00:18,435 --> 01:00:21,172
So why take a crowbar
to open this vault...

537
01:00:21,372 --> 01:00:23,540
...when there's a clicker right there?

538
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:24,674
Clicker?

539
01:00:25,441 --> 01:00:28,077
Gizmo. Like a VCR remote.

540
01:00:30,613 --> 01:00:32,581
Sounds amazing to me.

541
01:00:34,216 --> 01:00:36,852
Must have been a lot of valuables
in that vault.

542
01:00:40,622 --> 01:00:43,257
Close to five million, total value.

543
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,894
Is that funny?

544
01:00:47,261 --> 01:00:49,430
Are you trying to surprise me?

545
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:51,199
I was trying to surprise you.

546
01:00:51,399 --> 01:00:53,034
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

547
01:00:55,101 --> 01:00:56,436
There you go again.

548
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,443
Would the burglar use a disguise?

549
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:04,777
He might.

550
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:08,447
Get with the program,
if you want to catch this guy.

551
01:01:08,647 --> 01:01:12,618
It is a guy, we think?
Some sort of a loner? Weirdo, yeah?

552
01:01:12,818 --> 01:01:14,053
Maybe like you.

553
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:18,790
I'd be the perfect prototype, actually.

554
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:22,760
But you see a person long enough,
you start putting things together.

555
01:01:22,927 --> 01:01:25,964
That's why these top guys
have disguises.

556
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:29,399
Some of them, I understand,
become make-up experts.

557
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,969
Hire wigmakers and things like that.

558
01:01:32,436 --> 01:01:34,571
Why don't you go on
about the wigmakers?

559
01:01:34,771 --> 01:01:35,806
Well, I would...

560
01:01:36,673 --> 01:01:39,108
I must go have my pacemaker checked.

561
01:01:39,275 --> 01:01:41,677
It's been so exciting talking to you.

562
01:01:42,345 --> 01:01:46,082
A: You don't have a pacemaker.
And B: I'll be back tomorrow.

563
01:01:47,283 --> 01:01:49,751
Tomorrow is promised to no one.

564
01:01:53,088 --> 01:01:54,322
Good-bye.

565
01:01:59,293 --> 01:02:01,428
Pacemaker, my ass.

566
01:03:02,551 --> 01:03:04,052
Oh, Katie.

567
01:03:05,086 --> 01:03:08,022
You must start eating
better than this, darling.

568
01:03:11,759 --> 01:03:14,394
I'm having this
press conference here...

569
01:03:15,696 --> 01:03:18,599
...because it is at this courthouse...

570
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:23,303
...that Christine Sullivan's killer
will be tried for his crime.
