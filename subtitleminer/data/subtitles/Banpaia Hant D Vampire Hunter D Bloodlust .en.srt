00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:04,335
The distant future....

2
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:15,315
Vampires rule the night, but their numbers are dwindling.

3
00:02:15,985 --> 00:02:25,326
With huge bounties on their heads, a class of hunters has emerged, Bounty Hunters.

4
00:02:25,996 --> 00:02:31,837
One hunter is unlike all the others. He is a Dunpeal; a half human half vampire.

5
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:38,387
At war with himself, feared by all, tortured and alone, he is...

6
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:01,987
Here he comes!

7
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:07,001
Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. Blessed is the Lord Jesus Christ....

8
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:14,151
We've been expecting you

9
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,701
I'm Alan Elbourne, and I'm the one that summoned you here today for this reason.

10
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:25,312
Go on. I'm listening.

11
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:31,031
It's about my sister, Charlotte

12
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:34,682
Two nights ago she disappeared

13
00:04:36,262 --> 00:04:38,562
She was in bed, sleeping; it was the middle of the night.

14
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:42,172
Several people told us they saw a carriage outside our house.

15
00:04:43,352 --> 00:04:44,022
The carriage ...

16
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:47,333
... belonged to Meier Link, the vampire

17
00:04:49,043 --> 00:04:51,072
I organized a search party of fifty men

18
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,923
but it was no use; we couldn't find them

19
00:04:53,963 --> 00:04:54,893
We were ambushed.

20
00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:06,663
... took my sister and killed my friends.

21
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:12,494
That's just a down payment.

22
00:05:13,004 --> 00:05:14,324
You'll get the rest when you find her.

23
00:05:15,223 --> 00:05:17,053
Ten million dollars.

24
00:05:18,393 --> 00:05:19,505
But you better move fast

25
00:05:19,755 --> 00:05:20,805
you've got some competition.

26
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:22,884
I've hired the Markus Brothers

27
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:24,374
and they've got a head start on you.

28
00:05:24,994 --> 00:05:26,014
I don't think so.

29
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:27,094
Huh?

30
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:28,945
It may be too late for her

31
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:31,525
Your sister may already have been tempted.

32
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:32,295
What then?

33
00:05:34,485 --> 00:05:36,135
You have to get there before that happens

34
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:37,555
what do you think we're paying you for?!

35
00:05:37,324 --> 00:05:38,055
That's enough!

36
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:43,645
My son is emotional; please excuse him

37
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:45,475
This has been difficult for all of us.

38
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:47,356
If you knew my daughter, you'd understand

39
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:49,015
she's kind and beautiful

40
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,605
and her loss is more than this old soul can bear.

41
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,386
Now, I need to ask you something

42
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:58,605
if you find her changed, can you see that her death is without suffering.

43
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,166
Be kind to her, please.

44
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:01,226
No -- no!

45
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:03,345
We can't do that; it isn't right.

46
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:05,346
No! She won't be changed

47
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:07,116
you're talking about your daughter!

48
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:08,107
Alan, listen to me.

49
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:10,586
It's not easy to ask him for this

50
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:12,567
but it's something that must be done.

51
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,416
I'm sorry.

52
00:06:14,836 --> 00:06:15,607
Do you understand?

53
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,897
I understand your position, but ...

54
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,287
... ten million dollars is not enough.

55
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:22,167
What?

56
00:06:22,806 --> 00:06:23,607
How dare you!

57
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:25,346
Stop it

58
00:06:25,477 --> 00:06:26,627
hold your fire!

59
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:28,067
I said stop!

60
00:06:35,337 --> 00:06:36,297
I'll double the price.

61
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:38,568
I'll give you twenty million.

62
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:40,449
Just bring her back

63
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:42,798
one way or the other.

64
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,689
Did you see a carriage go by here with four horses in front?

65
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,700
Let me go

66
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,070
let me go

67
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,850
le

68
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,600
You're lying.

69
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:43,051
Oh, damn; we got company.

70
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:55,291
Lotsa company.

71
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:46,354
Look out!

72
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:53,994
Oh, man. Is everybody OK?

73
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:54,864
Yeah.

74
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:57,224
Do you believe that?

75
00:08:57,534 --> 00:08:59,494
The place is overrun with them.

76
00:08:59,994 --> 00:09:01,634
He musta been here already.

77
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:04,304
Well, c'mon

78
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:09,634
ready or not, here they come

79
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,594
It's zombie time.

80
00:09:14,535 --> 00:09:17,606
Yeah, come and get it, zombies!

81
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:19,655
Amen to that.

82
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:21,705
Leila, are you there?

83
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:23,345
It won't take long, Grove.

84
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:25,295
Just...stay in the tank.

85
00:09:31,685 --> 00:09:33,226
Can't load!

86
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:20,828
Not so fast, buddy.

87
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:22,667
And

88
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:24,107
fire!

89
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:29,438
Gotcha!

90
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:35,568
Rest in peace, huh?

91
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:38,579
You hear that?

92
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:41,898
Sounds like a horse.

93
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:44,599
It's moving...uphill

94
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:46,959
Let me try.

95
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,180
Right ...

96
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:57,389
right about ...

97
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,340
right there!

98
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,801
Beautiful, just beautiful.

99
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:37,592
I applaud you, stranger.

100
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:39,332
Tell me what you're doing here.

101
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:42,441
If we're in the same game, we should be friends.

102
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:43,541
Tell me your name.

103
00:11:44,022 --> 00:11:46,702
Mine's Borgoff, Borgoff Markus.

104
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:48,702
D.

105
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:56,702
Ah, so that's the guy, the dhampir hunter.

106
00:11:56,702 --> 00:11:57,773
I've heard about him.

107
00:11:57,773 --> 00:11:58,703
He's amazing.

108
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:02,003
Wake up, Borgoff, he's the competition, not some buddy of ours.

109
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:04,982
C'mon, what are we doing here, we just helped him, think about it.

110
00:12:05,053 --> 00:12:07,413
Yeah, he's right, I agree with him about that.

111
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:09,943
We help him too much and he'll take all the money.

112
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:12,473
If it wasn't for us, he'd be dead by now.

113
00:12:12,473 --> 00:12:15,473
We do the work and he gets the reward.

114
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:17,684
Ah, you boys should relax.

115
00:12:17,684 --> 00:12:21,074
We just did the famous dhampir a little favor is all.

116
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,053
A little favor we can't afford.

117
00:12:23,053 --> 00:12:23,504
Hey

118
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:25,973
y'ever hear the one about the owl and squirrel?

119
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:30,714
Squirrel works all summer storin' away stuff for the winter, all kinds of nuts and seeds

120
00:12:30,914 --> 00:12:32,074
works real hard.

121
00:12:32,304 --> 00:12:36,514
Then one day just before the first snow he goes outside for one last look around when

122
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:38,724
all of a sudden this owl swoops down and

123
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,265
grabs him, carries him off.

124
00:12:40,975 --> 00:12:43,284
"Ah, what a shame," says the squirrel

125
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:45,955
"'cause what's gonna happen to all that good food?"

126
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:59,195
Aw, that's a good one.

127
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,955
Yeah, hilarious.

128
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:03,805
You get it, you guys?

129
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:05,806
That stupid squirrel is all I can

130
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:07,355
Leila!

131
00:13:08,076 --> 00:13:10,075
Hey, Leila, what's the rush?

132
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:14,876
What's with her?

133
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:24,156
So you're outnumbered, four to one; so what?

134
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:28,637
They do have a head start, but when the sun comes up, the heat will slow 'em down.

135
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:35,837
Speaking of, ah, sun and heat, I know I don't need to remind you of your susceptibility.

136
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:37,838
It's called heat syndrome...

137
00:13:37,838 --> 00:13:40,557
and the last time you ignored it, you almost

138
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:41,597
Don't worry.

139
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:44,157
I hate it when you say that.

140
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,117
What...what are those ?

141
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:46,157
Tracks

142
00:13:46,397 --> 00:13:47,437
let me see

143
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,438
Yes, OK! these are definitely that tracks, six hours old I'd say

144
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:54,478
OK.

145
00:13:55,997 --> 00:13:57,748
I'm suffocating now.

146
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:01,569
Hey, how was that?

147
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:03,808
That's funny

148
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:05,808
I could have sworn I heard something.

149
00:14:05,808 --> 00:14:06,608
Quiet.

150
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:10,048
Sand mantas, most likely.

151
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:21,398
Sweet blasphemy, sand mantas galore!

152
00:14:21,398 --> 00:14:22,919
Talk about your prehistoric pigeons.

153
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:26,279
They're filthy animals, y'know, they're just filthy!

154
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,210
Well, I--I guess we better just turn back

155
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,649
it's a shame, really, 'cause you know, we could

156
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,360
No -- go back, man

157
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,119
go back, now, c'mon

158
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:39,559
you're crazy

159
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,039
c'mon, man -- please, let's' just go back

160
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:59,161
That -- that was good

161
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:01,161
OK, now, we survived that, could we stop?

162
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:05,720
Did...did you ever hear the expression "too close for comfort"?

163
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,482
That--that was damn uncomfortable.

164
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:25,801
What is it ? a resting house?

165
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,382
I didn't think anybody had those any more.

166
00:15:28,382 --> 00:15:29,641
They must be in there.

167
00:15:29,641 --> 00:15:32,122
Wow, it blends in nicely.

168
00:16:03,984 --> 00:16:07,173
OK...oh, here we are.

169
00:16:09,414 --> 00:16:11,014
I -- I see 'em.

170
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:13,253
How many are there?

171
00:16:13,493 --> 00:16:15,255
Two...I think.

172
00:16:15,414 --> 00:16:17,174
A man ... and a woman.

173
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,614
Look out for the exit door.

174
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:20,614
No door ...

175
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:21,655
no door there ...

176
00:16:21,655 --> 00:16:22,934
still no door...

177
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:24,454
no ...

178
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:35,645
Are you sure ... about that door ...?

179
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:43,165
No ... no ...

180
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:53,406
What was that?

181
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:10,927
She's out of her mind!

182
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:18,367
Door! DOOR!

183
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:20,047
You're dead!

184
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,029
I'm here for the young woman.

185
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:10,819
I wouldn't recommend it, dhampir.

186
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,989
Taking on a vampire at night is a mission for morons and fools.

187
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:15,920
which are you?

188
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:26,160
She's here by her own choice, dhampir.

189
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,121
So unless you're the kind of man who would take a woman against her will for the money in it

190
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:33,001
and I'm sure it's a lot

191
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:37,800
I suggest you save your sorry ass now and leave us to travel in peace.

192
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,760
I would if I could believe you, Meier.

193
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,921
Your credibility, however, is less than impeccable under the circumstances.

194
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:48,281
You kidnapped the girl.

195
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:57,462
Meier!

196
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,262
Oh, my nose, my nose!

197
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:05,102
What happened ?

198
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,302
what'd...what'd I miss?

199
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:08,662
She called out his name.

200
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:10,543
It may be true, what he said.

201
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:13,182
No, she's just ignorant

202
00:19:13,182 --> 00:19:14,382
she's a child.

203
00:19:14,462 --> 00:19:15,582
She doesn't know him yet.

204
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,223
She doesn't know what he's capable of.

205
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:35,043
That poor girl

206
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:37,683
she's...she's bleeding pretty bad.

207
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:39,494
I mean, she won't last long.

208
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:40,754
It's a shame

209
00:19:40,754 --> 00:19:43,594
really -- to waste all that good blood

210
00:19:43,594 --> 00:19:47,473
I mean -- come on, admit it -- you're tempted.

211
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,234
I mean, I know you are!

212
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:55,434
M...Mother...

213
00:19:57,035 --> 00:19:58,135
Wait, I was just kidding, y'know.

214
00:19:58,135 --> 00:19:58,854
C'mon, let's go.

215
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:00,054
We got work to do...

216
00:20:00,554 --> 00:20:01,715
...The money, c'mon; think of the money!

217
00:20:23,695 --> 00:20:25,116
Hey, what did you do to me?

218
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:29,656
I bound your wound and stopped your bleeding. That's all.

219
00:20:30,156 --> 00:20:31,116
Oh, I get it.

220
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,786
You think you can just go ahead and tear off the clothes of whoever you come across.

221
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:39,126
That's what you think, isn't it, DHAMPIR.

222
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:42,766
You should go back home and nurse your wounds.

223
00:20:42,886 --> 00:20:44,166
What are you, my mother?

224
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:47,207
You called out for your mother before

225
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:48,627
I thought you might be needing her.

226
00:20:50,887 --> 00:20:51,507
Hey

227
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:05,067
I see her.

228
00:21:19,397 --> 00:21:23,918
When the last vampire is extinct, who will mourn our passing?

229
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:27,178
Will she? will anyone?

230
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:34,689
Can anyone understand this pain, this loneliness?

231
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:04,050
I told you so, didn't I?

232
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,551
I said, leave the girl alone

233
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:07,570
she's trouble

234
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,830
she's competition, y'know.

235
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:12,270
YOU aided and abetted the enemy.

236
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,251
I hope this is the right way.

237
00:22:24,251 --> 00:22:26,790
Trust me, I know how they think, these vampires:

238
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,091
when they're threatened, they all head for Barbarois.

239
00:22:29,452 --> 00:22:30,592
They're so predictable.

240
00:22:30,652 --> 00:22:31,852
Barbarois, yeah

241
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,612
And I really hate that place.

242
00:22:34,011 --> 00:22:37,732
It's full of lunatics and monsters, and that old crazy man, y'know.

243
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:43,832
Does it hurt very much, Leila?

244
00:22:45,232 --> 00:22:45,772
Leila?

245
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:47,012
Huh?

246
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,411
Your injury...does it hurt you?

247
00:22:50,131 --> 00:22:51,253
Oh, no, it's fine.

248
00:22:51,313 --> 00:22:51,852
I...

249
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:56,552
Grove, you should lie down, you look tired.

250
00:22:56,552 --> 00:22:58,452
You need to rest...don't worry about me.

251
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:00,232
Leila...

252
00:23:01,712 --> 00:23:03,653
who dressed the wound? Was it him?

253
00:23:05,723 --> 00:23:06,783
You can tell me.

254
00:23:07,003 --> 00:23:09,243
It was him, wasn't it? The dhampir hunter.

255
00:23:10,362 --> 00:23:12,422
Leila, I'm warning you

256
00:23:12,422 --> 00:23:14,924
he...he's trouble. He's against us.

257
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,483
I don't know why he did that.

258
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:21,323
Grove, please don't tell anyone, OK?

259
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,314
He stopped there

260
00:23:32,134 --> 00:23:32,954
but what for?

261
00:23:33,994 --> 00:23:34,834
Let's find out.

262
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:36,895
Nolt and Kyle, you come with me

263
00:23:37,255 --> 00:23:38,835
Leila, you stay in here with Grove.

264
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:41,754
OK...is everybody ready?

265
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:42,414
Always.

266
00:23:42,414 --> 00:23:42,815
Ready.

267
00:23:42,815 --> 00:23:43,314
Yeah.

268
00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:16,686
Hey, Nolt,  see what's goin' on in there, willya?

269
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:18,066
It may be a trap.

270
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:19,886
Yeah, we'll cover you.

271
00:24:19,946 --> 00:24:22,027
It'll be my pleasure, gentlemen

272
00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:53,888
It's nothin' but a lousy piece of cloth.

273
00:24:54,587 --> 00:24:55,648
What the hell ?

274
00:24:56,068 --> 00:24:57,888
Bastard...unbelievable!

275
00:24:59,348 --> 00:25:00,269
Hey...watch out!

276
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:04,178
So...

277
00:25:04,778 --> 00:25:08,659
you dare to enter Barbarois

278
00:25:09,189 --> 00:25:15,588
I assume it's arrogance and vast stupidity that brings you here, gentlemen

279
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,849
or perhaps it's ignorance.

280
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:21,889
You're skillful hunters, I can see

281
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,409
but you're no match for the Barbarois.

282
00:25:25,969 --> 00:25:31,490
Five thousand years of isolation have made us invincible!

283
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:42,691
Huh?

284
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:43,720
What?

285
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,500
What the hell's going on?

286
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,271
The shadow...

287
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,790
...watch out for the shadow.

288
00:26:02,231 --> 00:26:03,211
What're you talking about?

289
00:26:03,722 --> 00:26:05,001
The shadow...whaddayou mean?

290
00:26:08,082 --> 00:26:08,861
Hey...Nolt?

291
00:26:18,812 --> 00:26:20,771
Hey, Nolt, what the hell happened to you, huh?

292
00:26:22,712 --> 00:26:23,632
He's...He's dead!

293
00:26:23,971 --> 00:26:24,831
No, he's not!

294
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:26,153
Come on, Nolt...

295
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:29,373
...come on, snap out of it, come on...

296
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:32,772
oh my God, damn it, come on!

297
00:26:33,732 --> 00:26:34,892
I need you!

298
00:26:36,382 --> 00:26:37,683
Oh God...Nolt !

299
00:26:53,963 --> 00:26:56,123
Oh, God...we're getting close.

300
00:26:56,623 --> 00:26:59,763
Those...are the windmills of the Barbarois.

301
00:27:00,144 --> 00:27:01,644
I really wish you'd turn back.

302
00:27:01,824 --> 00:27:03,324
There must be another way.

303
00:27:03,944 --> 00:27:04,904
There isn't.

304
00:27:18,994 --> 00:27:20,695
I am D, the hunter

305
00:27:21,334 --> 00:27:22,955
I have business with the Barbarois.

306
00:27:59,116 --> 00:28:01,456
Oh, no.....

307
00:28:09,707 --> 00:28:11,287
So I see you have dismounted.

308
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:12,967
You have respect for your elders.

309
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:14,987
That's very considerate indeed.

310
00:28:20,088 --> 00:28:23,207
I want you to stop your protection of Meier Link.

311
00:28:24,048 --> 00:28:24,868
You what?

312
00:28:26,688 --> 00:28:29,328
You know, you make me laugh, that's a good one.

313
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:33,489
I see you are a very humorous young man, and beautiful too, I might add.

314
00:28:33,489 --> 00:28:37,268
Or does that make you uncomfortable, to have an old lech like me admire you so?

315
00:28:37,928 --> 00:28:39,188
Do you take me for a fool?

316
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:42,709
Someone paid me a hundred million dollars to protect Meier Link.

317
00:28:42,828 --> 00:28:43,649
Can you top that?

318
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:46,859
Well, you drive a hard bargain there, old man

319
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:48,478
what if I can?

320
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:53,599
You really are entertaining me, Mr. Stranger!

321
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,179
I suppose you know our reputation

322
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:59,279
the Barbarois serve the people of the night,

323
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:04,439
and after five thousand years, I don't think we're about to change our stripes anytime soon,

324
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:06,879
although if we did for anyone it would be for you.

325
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,220
I have seen many a dhampir,

326
00:29:10,329 --> 00:29:12,949
but somebody like you I've never seen before.

327
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:16,830
That's why it's such a pity that you have to die.

328
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,130
I really can't let you leave here alive, now, can I?

329
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,830
I'm afraid you have to die, Stranger.

330
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,090
So sorry.

331
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,261
The Barbarois are great warriors.

332
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:29,020
You are a warrior too, no doubt

333
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:30,621
and although you may kill some of us,

334
00:29:30,621 --> 00:29:32,130
in the end we will prevail.

335
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:33,841
I have sworn to protect the carriage

336
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,340
prepare to die!

337
00:29:44,721 --> 00:29:45,361
Fool!

338
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:47,361
What's he doin' in there?

339
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,462
Borgoff, are we ready yet?

340
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,511
Grove

341
00:29:55,612 --> 00:29:56,671
we have no choice.

342
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:58,251
We need your help on this, Grove.

343
00:29:58,491 --> 00:30:00,031
Think you can do it there, man?

344
00:30:02,132 --> 00:30:02,973
Give it to me

345
00:30:03,472 --> 00:30:04,092
I'm waiting.

346
00:30:06,832 --> 00:30:08,372
Don't push yourself too hard, now.

347
00:30:08,372 --> 00:30:09,452
I mean it, OK

348
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:10,612
I want you back.

349
00:30:17,313 --> 00:30:20,473
You know, I really have nothing against the Barbarois personally.

350
00:30:21,012 --> 00:30:22,932
It's a shame I'll have to kill so many of you.

351
00:30:23,893 --> 00:30:26,853
Indeed, I admire your loyalty and your devotion to duty.

352
00:30:27,174 --> 00:30:31,413
Yet I wonder about the fairness when you allow one to fight against so many.

353
00:30:31,953 --> 00:30:32,253
But...

354
00:30:32,453 --> 00:30:33,913
if that will entertain you...

355
00:30:36,474 --> 00:30:37,794
I see.

356
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:40,894
you make I see. a good argument, young man

357
00:30:40,953 --> 00:30:42,034
how interesting.

358
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:46,915
Oh, man, I think the fellow is right.

359
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:50,914
Please allow the three of us to entertain our young guest here,

360
00:30:51,035 --> 00:30:53,634
unless he thinks that's unfair

361
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:58,215
three against one, how unfair, three against one, unfair...

362
00:30:59,155 --> 00:30:59,835
That's enough!

363
00:31:00,515 --> 00:31:03,434
You mock us with your ridiculous antics, Benge.

364
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:08,604
I will not have you distracting us from the job at hand, which is the protection of the carriage.

365
00:31:08,844 --> 00:31:10,986
We'll do things my way...huh?

366
00:31:17,765 --> 00:31:19,365
What the devil is that?

367
00:31:37,326 --> 00:31:39,487
Go for it, Grove...go for it!

368
00:31:40,286 --> 00:31:41,536
Kill all those guys

369
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:42,736
kill every last one of 'em!

370
00:31:46,857 --> 00:31:48,937
Come on, Grove, hold on.

371
00:31:57,328 --> 00:31:59,768
Get the carriage out now!

372
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:06,608
Follow me, Tinkerbell.

373
00:32:08,948 --> 00:32:10,628
I'm waiting for you!

374
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:36,739
Grove!

375
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:48,569
I've got to say this

376
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,170
I admire that young hunter's spirit,

377
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,430
although he doesn't stand a chance against Benge and the others.

378
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,510
Still, it's a pity I'll miss the show.

379
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,129
Oh well, c'est la vie.

380
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:32,061
Wake up, D!

381
00:33:32,581 --> 00:33:33,581
What's wrong with you?

382
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:41,132
It's not fair, it's not fair

383
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:42,772
I'll show you what's not fair!

384
00:33:42,972 --> 00:33:45,532
Stay there till you rot, hunter!

385
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:00,303
Suckers!

386
00:34:03,783 --> 00:34:05,363
Stop, I beg you.

387
00:34:06,023 --> 00:34:06,863
Say goodnight.

388
00:34:10,144 --> 00:34:12,684
Kyle, did you happen to see where that girl went?

389
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:14,523
Maybe she got caught in the wheels.

390
00:34:14,864 --> 00:34:15,623
Go look.

391
00:34:58,486 --> 00:35:00,285
Nice, Caroline, very nice.

392
00:35:00,285 --> 00:35:02,086
A little crude, but effective.

393
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:03,766
They're all yours!

394
00:35:07,347 --> 00:35:08,787
That freakin' monster.

395
00:35:09,686 --> 00:35:10,946
Is everybody all right?

396
00:35:11,306 --> 00:35:12,766
Yeah, but Kyle was outside.

397
00:35:12,766 --> 00:35:13,706
He was up on top.

398
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:17,616
Kyle?

399
00:35:17,977 --> 00:35:19,937
Kyle, where the hell are you, Kyle?

400
00:35:20,057 --> 00:35:20,937
Down here!

401
00:35:21,777 --> 00:35:22,277
You OK?

402
00:35:22,576 --> 00:35:24,137
Quiet! They're still around!

403
00:35:32,307 --> 00:35:32,608
No!

404
00:35:35,428 --> 00:35:36,287
Damn! That idiot!

405
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:39,467
Well, how convenient this is for me.

406
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:42,028
Come on out here so I can finish the job.

407
00:35:42,108 --> 00:35:43,028
Your time is up.

408
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,648
Come on, you coward!

409
00:35:44,968 --> 00:35:47,128
You're gonna pay for the pain you caused my brother.

410
00:35:52,808 --> 00:35:54,778
D! Are you awake?

411
00:36:00,018 --> 00:36:03,299
I need your help to swallow up this spell.

412
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:06,958
You're a slave driver, you know that?

413
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,660
Hey, remember to watch out for the shadow, huh?

414
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,181
Try and stay still.

415
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:50,041
Easier said than done.

416
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:51,481
And keep your mouth shut.

417
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,872
That was close...

418
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:30,572
Well, the tank is fulla holes.

419
00:37:31,632 --> 00:37:34,513
Fuel's all gone, we can't drive it like this anyway.

420
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:35,593
What're we gonna do?

421
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:39,513
What. Should. We. Do?

422
00:37:40,113 --> 00:37:41,512
Borgoff, any idea?

423
00:37:45,293 --> 00:37:45,854
How's Grove?

424
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:48,033
Honestly, not too great.

425
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:49,354
Borgoff, wake up!

426
00:37:49,413 --> 00:37:50,853
What are you thinking about over there?

427
00:37:52,293 --> 00:37:53,174
Oh, nothin', really.

428
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:54,994
I was just thinkin' about the carriage.

429
00:37:55,493 --> 00:37:56,634
Wonder where it is by now.

430
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:59,634
Well, man, at this point it's pretty much anybody's guess.

431
00:38:00,174 --> 00:38:07,134
If you want my opinion, I'd say they're either setting sail from the port of Abrol or hiding somewhere deep in the Grenerge Mountain Range.

432
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:09,135
I sure hope so.

433
00:38:11,174 --> 00:38:13,535
Anyway, we still have to get some fuel

434
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,705
and the town of Garucia isn't that far away from here.

435
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,825
Kyle, you go with Leila.

436
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:21,305
I'll stay here and do the repairs.

437
00:38:33,726 --> 00:38:37,846
If you are seeking the pathway to the stars, come to me.

438
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:41,906
I pray for your safe arrival with all my heart.

439
00:38:43,716 --> 00:38:45,876
The pathway to the stars....

440
00:39:07,187 --> 00:39:09,967
I dunno about you, but y'know, I sure miss that horse.

441
00:39:10,847 --> 00:39:11,807
What was his name?

442
00:39:13,127 --> 00:39:14,747
Oh...oh, the silent treatment, huh?

443
00:39:15,206 --> 00:39:17,328
Well, I got two words for you: Heat syndrome.

444
00:39:17,928 --> 00:39:21,708
Look -- look, I know I'm a parasite, but haven't I always been a helpful parasite?

445
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:23,608
You may not care if you die from heat

446
00:39:23,867 --> 00:39:26,928
but becoming a piece of beef jerky is not a lifelong ambition of mine.

447
00:39:27,578 --> 00:39:29,618
Yeah, well, what's the sound of one hand yapping...

448
00:39:42,818 --> 00:39:43,438
How much?

449
00:39:43,818 --> 00:39:45,118
Oh no -- keep your money.

450
00:39:45,678 --> 00:39:46,999
C'mon, just take it --

451
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,419
Let's go.

452
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:53,699
Leila?

453
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,859
Oh. I see.

454
00:39:57,919 --> 00:39:59,119
It's him, isn't it?

455
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,609
Kyle, why don't you start back without me.

456
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,729
There's something I want to do here first.

457
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,469
Back off.

458
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,061
Have I told you

459
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:14,950
you're quite irresistible in that sexy skin-tight getup?

460
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,191
No -- tell me about it.

461
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,110
I just did.

462
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,370
Make sure you watch your back with that guy, Leila.

463
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:38,522
I'd like a beer.

464
00:40:52,232 --> 00:40:55,052
I've just been admirin' your fancy weapon there.

465
00:40:56,012 --> 00:40:56,651
Don't worry.

466
00:40:56,732 --> 00:40:59,073
I have no plans to use it anytime soon.

467
00:40:59,613 --> 00:41:00,452
That's good.

468
00:41:00,993 --> 00:41:05,353
That's good, 'cause I have no plans to let you keep it.

469
00:41:06,212 --> 00:41:07,092
Give it up.

470
00:41:10,123 --> 00:41:11,503
You heard me, little girl.

471
00:41:21,673 --> 00:41:22,873
Mm. Thank you.

472
00:41:23,823 --> 00:41:25,413
Well, here's to ya, Sheriff.

473
00:41:25,923 --> 00:41:27,233
I'd buy you a drink, but...

474
00:41:27,413 --> 00:41:29,124
Thank you, but no thanks.

475
00:41:29,124 --> 00:41:36,094
Oh, OK. I was just gonna say, you must be awfully busy with that new dhampir hunter in the town now.

476
00:41:37,134 --> 00:41:38,394
What dhampir hunter?

477
00:41:45,124 --> 00:41:46,804
I'd like to buy that horse.

478
00:41:50,234 --> 00:41:52,094
Three hundred thousand dollars.

479
00:41:52,364 --> 00:41:54,965
And if you don't like the price, go somewhere else.

480
00:42:15,495 --> 00:42:19,536
Freeze! Put your hands where I can see 'em. Now!

481
00:42:21,296 --> 00:42:23,266
Sheriff, he paid good money for that.

482
00:42:29,097 --> 00:42:29,847
What are you doing?!

483
00:42:30,356 --> 00:42:31,677
Take your money and go.

484
00:42:33,737 --> 00:42:35,106
We don't want you here.

485
00:42:35,576 --> 00:42:39,677
We don't sell to dhampirs in this town, understand?

486
00:42:41,317 --> 00:42:43,117
Understand me, dhampir?

487
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,867
You understand.

488
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:49,156
Wait a minute. That's my horse you're talking about there,

489
00:42:49,336 --> 00:42:53,167
and I'll sell it to whoever I want if they can afford the price I'm asking.

490
00:42:53,768 --> 00:42:55,058
You can't do that.

491
00:42:55,058 --> 00:42:58,837
We have laws against it, Polk...good laws, and for a damn good reason.

492
00:42:59,138 --> 00:43:00,247
What laws?

493
00:43:00,337 --> 00:43:04,398
Don't play coy, Polk, you know as well as I dhampirs aren't allowed.

494
00:43:04,398 --> 00:43:06,478
Not allowed, right ...

495
00:43:06,568 --> 00:43:13,018
I remember a time not that long ago when we had vampires and dhampirs both around here. But...

496
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:15,418
And that's why we have the law.

497
00:43:15,418 --> 00:43:19,359
Listen to me, whether you want to hear it or not...you weren't even born when this happened.

498
00:43:19,628 --> 00:43:21,818
Do yourself a favor and listen to the story.

499
00:43:22,698 --> 00:43:25,749
I'm going to tell you about the time when the children were kidnapped.

500
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:28,129
There were ten children altogether ...

501
00:43:28,999 --> 00:43:30,349
Yeah, I heard about that time.

502
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:34,329
The kidnappers turned out to be vampires, of course.

503
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:38,820
And so the townspeople pooled their money to hire a vampire hunter.

504
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:40,429
They wanted the best.

505
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:42,979
And when the hunter came...

506
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,340
he was a very strong and quiet man.

507
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:51,300
and he did his job, too, which was to return the children safely back into their parents' homes.

508
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:57,200
It wasn't easy, but many vampires died by his hands before this job was over with.

509
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,291
And when it was over and the children were back home,

510
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:01,990
the people attacked the man.

511
00:44:02,161 --> 00:44:06,550
They said he was a dhampir, half vampire himself...so they punished him.

512
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,721
Can't say I blame them for doing that.

513
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:13,161
You can't trust 'em, that's all that's about.

514
00:44:13,421 --> 00:44:15,161
They were right about that part, Polk.

515
00:44:16,651 --> 00:44:17,881
He did the job!

516
00:44:18,341 --> 00:44:22,031
I see then, I'll have to take matters into my own hands.

517
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:23,412
Let him go.

518
00:44:24,492 --> 00:44:25,562
What is that?

519
00:44:26,391 --> 00:44:27,871
What does it look like, idiot?

520
00:44:27,871 --> 00:44:28,902
Put down your guns.

521
00:44:29,052 --> 00:44:32,081
Polk, you can't know what you're doing ... put it down...

522
00:44:32,081 --> 00:44:34,082
I know exactly what I'm doing.

523
00:44:34,232 --> 00:44:37,462
You DON'T know! Put it down now, you old fool!

524
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:43,102
I would much rather be an old fool than what you are, Sheriff.

525
00:44:45,793 --> 00:44:47,023
Now, don't shoot.

526
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:51,433
I can tell you I won't think twice about using this weapon.

527
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,443
I might even enjoy it.

528
00:44:53,692 --> 00:44:55,323
Get on your horse, Stranger.

529
00:44:55,834 --> 00:44:56,473
Thank you.

530
00:44:57,663 --> 00:45:00,443
No, it's only fitting I thank you.

531
00:45:00,783 --> 00:45:02,193
It's the least I can do.

532
00:45:04,673 --> 00:45:09,794
I may be just an old fool now, Stranger,  but I could never forget a face like yours.

533
00:45:10,053 --> 00:45:12,754
And I'll never forget what you done for me back then.

534
00:45:13,173 --> 00:45:15,824
That's right...I was one of them kids.

535
00:45:21,814 --> 00:45:23,904
And I always felt bad about that

536
00:45:24,544 --> 00:45:26,044
the way you was treated.

537
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:32,235
How nobody stopped you, nobody thanked you instead the ignorant bastards ran you right out of our town.

538
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:36,105
So it's true, isn't it, what they say about you dhampirs.

539
00:45:36,955 --> 00:45:38,115
You don't age.

540
00:45:38,115 --> 00:45:39,735
Now go...I'm getting tired.

541
00:46:01,876 --> 00:46:04,187
Where's Benge? What's taking him so long?

542
00:46:04,857 --> 00:46:07,716
Well, the horses are rested now. We'd better go.

543
00:46:08,487 --> 00:46:09,216
Come on.

544
00:46:14,127 --> 00:46:16,607
Master, what is it? May I help you, sir?

545
00:46:19,247 --> 00:46:20,917
It's still light outside, Master!

546
00:46:23,257 --> 00:46:23,797
What...?

547
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:26,297
Leave her alone, Mashira.

548
00:46:26,948 --> 00:46:27,727
Yes, sir.

549
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:31,967
She misses the sunlight. Let her enjoy it.

550
00:47:14,279 --> 00:47:15,889
I am D, the hunter.

551
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,829
Your father sent me.

552
00:47:19,329 --> 00:47:22,200
Don't be afraid...I won't hurt you.

553
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:28,140
You sit in the sunlight...you must not be changed.

554
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,149
So why do you stay with him?

555
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,431
Last night in the carriage you called out his name.

556
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:37,971
Why did you call for him?

557
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:45,291
I suppose my father has not told you that I'm in love with Meier.

558
00:47:45,601 --> 00:47:47,651
You don't know who he is.

559
00:47:47,961 --> 00:47:49,651
You can't be in love with him.

560
00:47:49,651 --> 00:47:50,691
Well, I am.

561
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,841
If you only knew how good he's been to me.

562
00:47:53,701 --> 00:47:54,841
I love him.

563
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:59,102
Please believe me; no one else will.

564
00:48:00,842 --> 00:48:02,101
You don't understand.

565
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:05,321
He is what he is, Charlotte.

566
00:48:05,831 --> 00:48:08,362
You can't change him; he'll take you in time.

567
00:48:08,672 --> 00:48:11,302
And when that happens, I will have to kill you.

568
00:48:11,912 --> 00:48:13,422
Fine; kill me, then.

569
00:48:13,622 --> 00:48:16,462
I would rather die than to go anywhere without him.

570
00:48:16,771 --> 00:48:20,942
Don't take me back there...I mean it. I simply could not live without Meier.

571
00:48:21,243 --> 00:48:23,192
How sweet that is.

572
00:48:25,033 --> 00:48:26,782
She loves a vampire.

573
00:48:28,312 --> 00:48:29,993
So very sweet.

574
00:48:31,644 --> 00:48:32,333
Idiot!

575
00:48:33,803 --> 00:48:36,123
You stupid girl, get up! We're going.

576
00:48:36,533 --> 00:48:37,493
Leave me alone!

577
00:48:38,553 --> 00:48:40,022
You'll do what I say.

578
00:48:40,123 --> 00:48:46,174
Do you have any idea how many people have died at the hands of your beloved Meier, this vampire you wanna protect!

579
00:48:45,494 --> 00:48:46,174
None!

580
00:48:47,813 --> 00:48:52,154
You fool! And you...You stay right where you are, my friend.

581
00:48:52,604 --> 00:48:56,124
Sorry, but I really don't want to have to share any of my profits.

582
00:48:57,624 --> 00:49:00,664
You understand, don't you...it's business.

583
00:49:07,854 --> 00:49:08,605
Above you.

584
00:49:39,816 --> 00:49:42,036
What's wrong? Tell me!

585
00:49:46,146 --> 00:49:47,926
Too much sun.

586
00:49:54,056 --> 00:49:57,677
I warned you about the heat, but you don't listen!

587
00:50:09,646 --> 00:50:15,157
Come on. You can't survive unless you dig a hole. You need to bury yourself!

588
00:50:58,930 --> 00:50:59,990
Hurry!

589
00:51:36,851 --> 00:51:40,951
Leila! Leila, are you there? Come in, Leila.

590
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:42,452
Yeah, I copy.

591
00:51:42,452 --> 00:51:45,591
Thank God. Are you OK? What's your position?

592
00:51:46,512 --> 00:51:49,381
I'm near Lake Chiffon. Our game is heading north from here.

593
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:50,792
We'll catch up.

594
00:51:51,132 --> 00:51:54,032
Leila, do you know what's happened to the dhampir hunter?

595
00:51:54,732 --> 00:51:56,882
No; I haven't seen him.

596
00:51:56,882 --> 00:51:58,632
All right. Well, take care.

597
00:51:58,933 --> 00:52:00,743
Stay in touch. Borgoff out.

598
00:52:13,703 --> 00:52:15,313
The tables have turned.

599
00:52:49,694 --> 00:52:51,645
Now, that cleared my head.

600
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:55,635
I really should return the favor, don't you think, honey?

601
00:53:51,307 --> 00:53:53,017
Don't get any ideas.

602
00:53:53,867 --> 00:53:56,027
Hey, I'm just trying to stay dry here.

603
00:53:56,907 --> 00:53:59,988
If there was any other place to go, believe me, I'd be there.

604
00:54:00,378 --> 00:54:03,898
As soon as the rain lets up, I'll be gone from here and from you.

605
00:54:09,938 --> 00:54:12,678
I think I can guess your problem.

606
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,128
Your family was the victim of vampires.

607
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:19,138
You don't know what you're talking about.

608
00:54:20,158 --> 00:54:21,799
You don't know anything about it.

609
00:54:23,129 --> 00:54:25,219
All right. Perhaps I don't.

610
00:54:27,049 --> 00:54:29,559
This stupid thing...it bothers me.

611
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,289
You really are a weird one, you know that?

612
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:37,639
In spite of being a dhampir hunter and all that that entails.

613
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:40,390
How did you know about my mother?

614
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:42,659
You called her name, remember?

615
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,500
She was kidnapped by vampires.

616
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:50,100
My father went after her and was trying to rescue her ... so they killed him.

617
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,850
And after a while my mother returned, but she wasn't my mother any more

618
00:54:55,121 --> 00:54:56,411
she'd been changed.

619
00:54:56,851 --> 00:55:00,020
The people in the village stoned her to death while I watched.

620
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,671
After that I left home.

621
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:04,330
I met the Markus brothers and joined with them.

622
00:55:04,361 --> 00:55:07,712
I wanted to be a hunter to avenge my parents' deaths.

623
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:13,930
I've seen many terrible things since then, lives destroyed, families devastated, hopes crushed...

624
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:17,252
every time, it seems ... vampire is to blame.

625
00:55:19,101 --> 00:55:23,712
I can understand why you'd choose to do it, but the life of a hunter is no kind of life.

626
00:55:24,162 --> 00:55:28,912
It's the only life I'm any good for now, and it looks like it's the only life you've ever known.

627
00:55:29,273 --> 00:55:31,452
So I suggest we make a pact.

628
00:55:31,992 --> 00:55:38,452
Since we're both in it for the long haul, whoever dies first, the other one can come and bring flowers to their grave.

629
00:55:39,382 --> 00:55:40,103
How's that?

630
00:55:40,533 --> 00:55:41,523
It's the rain

631
00:55:42,243 --> 00:55:43,793
makes me sentimental.

632
00:55:44,063 --> 00:55:47,353
I don't know why I should care about that...it's just I love flowers.

633
00:55:47,622 --> 00:55:49,363
And I don't think I'll be getting any...

634
00:55:49,532 --> 00:55:51,123
I'm all alone, after all.

635
00:55:51,963 --> 00:55:53,724
We have that much in common, don't we.

636
00:55:53,843 --> 00:55:55,723
That we're both hunters and we're both alone.

637
00:55:56,803 --> 00:56:00,123
Oh well, I'm being silly...doesn't really matter

638
00:56:00,933 --> 00:56:01,773
I'll do it.

639
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:07,484
I'll bring you flowers if I survive this...but I don't expect to.

640
00:56:07,693 --> 00:56:09,993
Stop, I didn't really mean it when I said that.

641
00:56:10,444 --> 00:56:13,945
And anyway, I don't really understand why you should keep on doing this.

642
00:56:17,894 --> 00:56:19,184
Because I'm a dhampir.

643
00:56:20,025 --> 00:56:22,714
I don't get to have a life; not like you.

644
00:56:55,796 --> 00:56:58,936
Well, with the rainstorm last night, they can't be too far away.

645
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:03,186
We're even now, dhampir...understand?

646
00:57:12,277 --> 00:57:15,477
I have a very bad feeling about this.

647
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:16,647
How so?

648
00:57:16,837 --> 00:57:19,976
I think I've finally figured it out, Borgoff.

649
00:57:21,457 --> 00:57:25,767
Well, I'm sure you're right...if you're thinking they're headed for the castle.

650
00:57:26,648 --> 00:57:29,727
Yeah, that's right, the castle...the Castle of Chaythe!

651
00:57:29,858 --> 00:57:34,578
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, WE CAN'T GO IN THERE, IT WOULD BE SUICIDE!

652
00:57:35,108 --> 00:57:37,327
What are you now, afraid of a little insanity?

653
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:38,848
Since when have we been sane?

654
00:57:39,387 --> 00:57:41,808
We just have to get to them before they reach the castle.

655
00:57:43,737 --> 00:57:47,558
There's a bridge up ahead...that's where we intercept the carriage.

656
00:57:48,178 --> 00:57:51,788
I remember that trick from the time we got those vampires at Keldo.

657
00:57:51,788 --> 00:57:55,118
Yeah, it worked that time, and it can work again now.

658
00:57:55,729 --> 00:57:58,199
Leila, come in; come in, Leila. Over.

659
00:57:58,569 --> 00:57:59,799
Yeah it's me, I copy.

660
00:58:00,169 --> 00:58:01,069
What's up?

661
00:58:01,439 --> 00:58:02,718
I'm on my way.

662
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,070
Don't move.

663
00:58:38,061 --> 00:58:42,451
I'm warning you...try anything funny and you'll be blown to smithereens.

664
00:58:43,911 --> 00:58:44,941
You wanna try it?

665
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:47,200
I didn't think so.

666
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:50,650
We just want the girl.

667
00:58:59,361 --> 00:59:00,511
Hello there!

668
00:59:01,321 --> 00:59:02,561
She's still human!

669
00:59:03,302 --> 00:59:05,962
Come on, get out of there. NOW!

670
00:59:07,942 --> 00:59:09,502
Borgoff, she won't come.

671
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:12,462
We're doing you a favor!

672
00:59:16,693 --> 00:59:20,022
Come ON, I said get outta there!

673
00:59:30,453 --> 00:59:33,613
Let that be a lesson to ya, you cowardly Barbarois animal.

674
00:59:33,733 --> 00:59:34,723
Borgoff, look.

675
00:59:35,213 --> 00:59:35,992
Borgoff!

676
00:59:35,992 --> 00:59:37,763
What? What the --?

677
00:59:49,214 --> 00:59:50,974
What, is this guy crazy?

678
00:59:51,104 --> 00:59:54,054
Doesn't he know he can't exist outside here in the sunlight?

679
00:59:56,023 --> 00:59:58,574
I won't let you take her!

680
00:59:58,824 --> 00:59:59,803
Oh, yeah?

681
01:00:04,575 --> 01:00:06,994
Thanks a lot...you're making our job a lot easier.

682
01:00:07,245 --> 01:00:08,355
Hot enough for ya?

683
01:00:08,595 --> 01:00:09,835
What you deserve!

684
01:00:23,476 --> 01:00:24,996
Over here, hot stuff!

685
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,146
Oohoo, lookit him burn!

686
01:00:32,765 --> 01:00:33,376
No!

687
01:00:33,376 --> 01:00:34,657
What the hell do you want...

688
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:38,066
How's that feel...moron...!

689
01:00:44,596 --> 01:00:45,137
lookit him!

690
01:00:46,327 --> 01:00:47,387
Hey, where do you think...!

691
01:00:47,517 --> 01:00:48,496
Why'd you let her go!

692
01:01:00,437 --> 01:01:01,297
I love you.

693
01:01:20,298 --> 01:01:22,268
I can't go on without you.

694
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:28,368
What?

695
01:01:34,479 --> 01:01:36,939
Borgoff, we should just let her kill herself

696
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:40,189
and then we can finish him off, what do you think about that idea?

697
01:01:40,308 --> 01:01:41,829
We get the money if she's dead or alive.

698
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:43,720
Hey, you're right...OK.

699
01:01:51,489 --> 01:01:52,309
Stop it!

700
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,580
Kyle!

701
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:01,790
I'll blow you to hell!

702
01:02:05,341 --> 01:02:06,080
What!

703
01:02:35,951 --> 01:02:38,702
I don't want you to worry about these wounds of mine.

704
01:02:40,352 --> 01:02:41,292
They will heal.

705
01:02:41,292 --> 01:02:44,412
Then we shall go to the city of night and distant stars.

706
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:49,171
When we go there we can be alone and free to love each other.

707
01:02:50,973 --> 01:02:56,183
It's true, believe me; we'll be there soon.

708
01:03:41,074 --> 01:03:46,846
We're it now; we're the only ones left, Borgoff; we should just give it up.

709
01:03:49,895 --> 01:03:53,715
If we make it into that castle, none of us will make it out alive.

710
01:03:53,965 --> 01:03:55,485
We CAN'T quit now.

711
01:03:56,224 --> 01:03:59,596
We owe it to Kyle and to Nolt to keep going on.

712
01:04:02,516 --> 01:04:03,626
Listen, Borgoff...

713
01:04:03,666 --> 01:04:05,306
Shaddup! I won't hear it.

714
01:04:09,736 --> 01:04:12,196
Leila...what do you think?

715
01:04:13,176 --> 01:04:14,786
Grove, they fear us.

716
01:04:15,156 --> 01:04:19,465
They fear us because they know our reputation. That we never give up.

717
01:04:19,715 --> 01:04:21,106
And we never can.

718
01:04:21,847 --> 01:04:25,377
If we quit now, we might as well quit the business, and I can't do that.

719
01:04:25,506 --> 01:04:28,916
I won't do it...till every last one of them is gone.

720
01:04:48,757 --> 01:04:51,748
Master...do you hear?

721
01:04:52,857 --> 01:04:53,887
He is coming.

722
01:04:54,508 --> 01:04:55,988
The castle is nearby.

723
01:04:56,108 --> 01:04:57,508
I'll stay here and deal with him.

724
01:05:23,809 --> 01:05:26,029
Getting close. The Castle of Chaythe.

725
01:05:26,439 --> 01:05:27,908
Soon we'll be able to see it

726
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,689
the home of Carmila, the Bloody Countess.

727
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:33,340
You've heard of her.

728
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:38,219
For five thousand years her rule of terror lasted, and then, that was that!

729
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:46,840
Your father, the vampire king, grew angry.

730
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:52,241
He was impatient with her vanity; offended by her bloodlust, her gluttony.

731
01:05:52,611 --> 01:05:59,670
He grew so tired that he killed her while she slept, impaling her on a sword, and that was it for her.

732
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:06,541
Except she haunts the place now with phantoms and demons, but you don't care about that, do you?

733
01:06:07,241 --> 01:06:09,751
But I bet I know what really gets to you, dhampir

734
01:06:10,731 --> 01:06:12,501
what REALLY gets to you

735
01:06:12,871 --> 01:06:17,392
the thought of those two lovebirds giving birth to another dhampir, huh?

736
01:06:17,392 --> 01:06:18,172
That's it.

737
01:06:19,091 --> 01:06:26,572
You see, I know you; I know how you think, I know how you feel, I know every move that you make, you can't...

738
01:07:37,996 --> 01:07:40,505
I'm glad we could meet at last, Hunter D.

739
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:42,265
You are a worthy opponent.

740
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,166
Who hired the Barbarois?

741
01:07:46,666 --> 01:07:48,186
Who were you working for?

742
01:07:50,856 --> 01:07:52,706
It was Carmila who hired us.

743
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:55,297
And as a Barbarois, my duty has been fulfilled.

744
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:57,927
Now I can die in peace.

745
01:08:05,626 --> 01:08:08,827
I gather from your letter that you had a rather difficult time.

746
01:08:09,197 --> 01:08:10,967
I think I can understand what it's like.

747
01:08:11,377 --> 01:08:13,346
Love is not unique to humans, you know

748
01:08:13,467 --> 01:08:15,727
we vampires are very susceptible.

749
01:08:16,097 --> 01:08:17,728
I hope I can be of service.

750
01:08:18,237 --> 01:08:19,978
We're very grateful, Carmila.

751
01:08:24,918 --> 01:08:26,638
You both must be exhausted.

752
01:08:26,767 --> 01:08:28,408
Perhaps you should rest first.

753
01:08:28,527 --> 01:08:30,998
I'm sure that the young lady would like to freshen up.

754
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:46,348
You've probably heard rumors about me, but I can assure you, they all stem from jealousy and envy.

755
01:08:46,468 --> 01:08:49,468
I'm not the "Bloody Carmila" they like to portray me as.

756
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:51,729
Now, behold...

757
01:09:00,418 --> 01:09:02,970
That's it; that is the ship.

758
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:08,839
It will take you to the city of the night where you can live peacefully at last.

759
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:11,179
You can be happy there.

760
01:09:12,809 --> 01:09:20,570
There was a time, many years ago, when every castle had a ship like this one and the night sky was full of their flashing lights.

761
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:27,601
Those were the days when vampires flourished and a love like yours was not so desperately impossible.

762
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:30,431
So different from today.

763
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:36,760
Our numbers dwindling, hunted and alone, we're hopelessly misunderstood

764
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:42,171
but you two seem to have beaten the odds.

765
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,441
I'm very very happy for you.

766
01:09:50,672 --> 01:09:52,472
The ship hasn't been used in years.

767
01:09:52,962 --> 01:09:57,322
I've no idea if it will fly safely, but I'm sure that's a risk you're prepared to take.

768
01:09:59,682 --> 01:10:00,953
We're very grateful.

769
01:10:01,852 --> 01:10:03,952
I only wish I could go with you.

770
01:10:11,243 --> 01:10:12,843
You look so beautiful.

771
01:10:44,724 --> 01:10:48,374
Why stop? I want you, Meier. I want all of you.

772
01:10:52,774 --> 01:10:53,763
Why not?

773
01:10:54,494 --> 01:10:57,005
You don't know what it's like, Charlotte

774
01:10:57,494 --> 01:11:05,624
to live forever in darkness eternal, forever thirsting for blood despite your best intention.

775
01:11:06,285 --> 01:11:09,855
I can't imagine that life for you; not for you, Charlotte.

776
01:11:10,105 --> 01:11:11,746
You're so selfish, Meier.

777
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:17,125
I carry a heavy weight on my conscience.

778
01:11:18,666 --> 01:11:23,886
Those villagers and the bounty hunter and my family...they still mourn my loss, Meier.

779
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:26,635
It wasn't your doing, Charlotte.

780
01:11:27,126 --> 01:11:29,146
It was my fault entirely.

781
01:11:30,007 --> 01:11:34,566
Well, then we're both to blame, because we can't know happiness; not anymore.

782
01:11:34,876 --> 01:11:39,806
I wanted you to be happy, Meier, and so I abandoned my father and my brother for you.

783
01:11:40,426 --> 01:11:44,946
But their pain set the wheels in motion for our pain, and so on and on it goes.

784
01:11:47,987 --> 01:11:51,266
All we have is each other now, and I want to be close to you.

785
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:53,937
Without that we have nothing.

786
01:11:58,727 --> 01:12:02,387
All the pain I've caused and all the agony I feel is nothing now!

787
01:12:02,997 --> 01:12:05,058
And you are everything to me, my love.

788
01:12:15,478 --> 01:12:19,089
We'll talk more on our trip to the stars, if that's all right with you.

789
01:12:23,358 --> 01:12:26,519
There is some unfinished business I have to attend to.

790
01:12:28,129 --> 01:12:30,099
Do not leave this room, understand?

791
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:09,700
D.

792
01:13:21,781 --> 01:13:25,272
Listen, Meier. The woman says she wants to go back home.

793
01:13:34,291 --> 01:13:36,552
I don't ... believe it.

794
01:13:59,453 --> 01:14:00,563
Charlotte....

795
01:14:12,923 --> 01:14:16,293
I dunno, something's not right.

796
01:14:17,353 --> 01:14:20,754
'Course, ah, you don't have to take my word for it

797
01:14:22,434 --> 01:14:24,364
you can judge for yourself.

798
01:14:56,276 --> 01:14:57,016
Let's go!

799
01:15:00,185 --> 01:15:01,905
Leila, don't go.

800
01:15:03,055 --> 01:15:05,066
Leila, don't go in there.

801
01:15:05,316 --> 01:15:08,026
If you go in there, you're never coming back!

802
01:15:08,396 --> 01:15:10,166
Oh, I'm coming back.

803
01:15:12,256 --> 01:15:12,876
No!

804
01:15:30,907 --> 01:15:32,177
Leila, check upstairs.

805
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:33,287
I'm on it.

806
01:15:39,938 --> 01:15:41,258
Nice hat.

807
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:30,020
I know you hate me, D.

808
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,810
Please try and understand.

809
01:16:33,549 --> 01:16:35,069
I loved your father.

810
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:37,330
What choice did I have?

811
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,181
Nolt, Kyle

812
01:17:04,171 --> 01:17:06,551
hey, I don't believe it!

813
01:17:06,841 --> 01:17:09,632
You two sure are a sight for sore eyes!

814
01:17:37,173 --> 01:17:39,262
What are you doing? Get up!

815
01:17:40,543 --> 01:17:42,923
Why aren't you listening...I said get up!

816
01:17:45,224 --> 01:17:46,363
Go away.

817
01:17:51,983 --> 01:17:53,093
Get out of here!

818
01:18:03,814 --> 01:18:05,333
Can you forgive me, D?

819
01:18:07,054 --> 01:18:07,465
D?

820
01:18:08,744 --> 01:18:10,584
I know it's been lonely for you.

821
01:18:12,194 --> 01:18:13,504
I was lonely too

822
01:18:14,244 --> 01:18:15,884
until you came along.

823
01:18:16,954 --> 01:18:18,475
Did you hear? D?

824
01:18:29,186 --> 01:18:30,295
It's OK, honey

825
01:18:31,025 --> 01:18:32,175
it's OK to cry.

826
01:18:32,795 --> 01:18:34,765
I know ... I know how you feel.

827
01:18:36,655 --> 01:18:39,195
It wasn't your fault. It wasn't.

828
01:18:40,306 --> 01:18:41,666
Yes it was!

829
01:18:42,566 --> 01:18:43,636
Let go!

830
01:18:55,287 --> 01:18:56,437
It's just an illusion.

831
01:18:57,297 --> 01:18:58,606
Carmila's playing with us.

832
01:19:01,726 --> 01:19:03,537
Excellent...what fun!

833
01:19:05,097 --> 01:19:07,237
I haven't had this much fun in centuries!

834
01:19:07,557 --> 01:19:08,877
You don't mind, do you?

835
01:19:08,997 --> 01:19:11,706
It just makes things so much more interesting.

836
01:19:12,777 --> 01:19:15,658
You're doing very well, by the way very well indeed.

837
01:19:16,887 --> 01:19:18,897
The woman...where are you hiding her?

838
01:19:30,708 --> 01:19:33,588
Borgoff...what are you doing! We don't have time for this!

839
01:19:34,248 --> 01:19:36,868
Leila -- are you in love with this dhampir?

840
01:19:36,868 --> 01:19:39,089
Are you crazy? What is wrong with you

841
01:19:41,468 --> 01:19:42,008
Borgoff!

842
01:19:48,569 --> 01:19:49,229
Dhampir

843
01:19:50,169 --> 01:19:51,239
drop your weapon.

844
01:20:02,569 --> 01:20:03,590
Drop it now!

845
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,890
She took you in, didn't she?

846
01:20:08,559 --> 01:20:13,360
She'll die! I'm warning you, dhampir, don't come any closer.

847
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,580
Enough! Now you die

848
01:20:28,021 --> 01:20:28,720
Grove!

849
01:20:29,131 --> 01:20:31,141
Grove, no!

850
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:37,551
Lei ... la ...

851
01:21:40,304 --> 01:21:43,465
Look...she's coming...Carmila.

852
01:21:48,384 --> 01:21:50,484
The spirit of Carmila!

853
01:22:25,936 --> 01:22:33,706
Dhampir hunter...your mother was human, but your father was a vampire, and you're betraying his ancient blood.

854
01:22:34,396 --> 01:22:36,776
You side with humans against us.

855
01:22:39,817 --> 01:22:44,867
Your people are facing extinction, and you're contributing to their demise.

856
01:22:45,406 --> 01:22:49,218
You stalk and kill your own ancestors, dhampir

857
01:22:51,478 --> 01:22:54,847
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!

858
01:22:56,077 --> 01:22:58,497
Your human self is your weaker self.

859
01:22:58,617 --> 01:23:00,388
Humans are nothing more than livestock.

860
01:23:00,468 --> 01:23:02,648
We prey on them as they prey on beasts.

861
01:23:02,767 --> 01:23:04,658
This is the rule of nature!

862
01:23:17,458 --> 01:23:19,798
Your time is coming to an end.

863
01:23:20,168 --> 01:23:22,468
Your kind must face extinction.

864
01:23:22,759 --> 01:23:25,488
You cannot survive; you must die.

865
01:23:25,749 --> 01:23:27,719
That is the rule of nature.

866
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:31,539
Ah...very strong words for a dhampir.

867
01:23:32,029 --> 01:23:37,369
But you seem to forget...our spirits are eternal.

868
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:41,179
No, Carmila; nothing lasts forever.

869
01:23:43,909 --> 01:23:44,589
I see.

870
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:49,150
I should have known better than to reason with your kind, dhampir hunter.

871
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:52,190
I guess my only option is to use force.

872
01:24:31,352 --> 01:24:32,702
No...this can't happen!

873
01:24:57,983 --> 01:25:00,613
Are you the son of the vampire king?

874
01:25:01,023 --> 01:25:04,062
Who are you? Who are you, dhampir?

875
01:25:08,993 --> 01:25:10,393
Such power...!

876
01:25:40,175 --> 01:25:43,465
Charlotte, come back. I need you; please come back.

877
01:25:53,765 --> 01:25:55,485
Darling, is that you?

878
01:25:56,105 --> 01:25:58,286
Oh yes. It's me...Meier.

879
01:25:59,185 --> 01:26:04,196
I'm so happy, Meier, because we are together now. At last.

880
01:26:04,566 --> 01:26:06,576
Together. At last.

881
01:26:09,076 --> 01:26:10,756
You made me happy, Meier.

882
01:26:11,376 --> 01:26:16,257
You let me dream. You let me dream of our beautiful trip to the stars.

883
01:26:16,626 --> 01:26:17,536
Our dream.

884
01:26:18,517 --> 01:26:21,026
Our beautiful, wonderful dream.

885
01:26:21,686 --> 01:26:25,377
It's not a dream. We are going to those stars, Charlotte.

886
01:26:26,117 --> 01:26:27,927
Oh, my dear one.

887
01:26:29,777 --> 01:26:31,787
You and I will get away from here.

888
01:26:32,147 --> 01:26:36,828
We will fly together to the city of the night where we were meant to be free from all of this

889
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:39,988
where you can rest, my love, finally, and be free.

890
01:26:40,608 --> 01:26:45,047
Yes...freedom! At last....

891
01:26:58,549 --> 01:27:01,219
My precious, precious love.

892
01:27:07,739 --> 01:27:10,619
Let's go...away from here.

893
01:27:19,798 --> 01:27:21,080
Stop right there, Meier.

894
01:27:23,230 --> 01:27:26,710
I'm taking her back...back to her family who loved her.

895
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:35,900
She knew I loved her best of all.

896
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:40,660
You can't understand it. You've never loved a human.

897
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:42,680
I've never killed one, either.

898
01:27:44,411 --> 01:27:49,111
You struggle to resist this nature of ours, but it can't last forever, D.

899
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:52,731
The urge for their blood is stronger.

900
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:55,812
If that day comes, then another will hunt me.

901
01:27:56,182 --> 01:27:57,572
It's as simple as that.

902
01:28:32,623 --> 01:28:35,293
What a waste. What a sad waste.

903
01:29:08,655 --> 01:29:13,104
Enough of killing. Enough of misery and death.

904
01:29:14,745 --> 01:29:16,015
I've had enough.

905
01:29:36,696 --> 01:29:38,336
I've ... had enough!

906
01:30:05,187 --> 01:30:11,388
Why ... did you miss ... my heart?

907
01:30:25,798 --> 01:30:29,118
She's dead. The ring is all I need.

908
01:30:29,858 --> 01:30:31,298
I'll take it to her father.

909
01:30:32,367 --> 01:30:33,299
As proof.

910
01:31:47,361 --> 01:31:50,112
Mind giving me a ride just as far as the next town?

911
01:31:50,602 --> 01:31:51,833
I'd appreciate it.

912
01:31:56,512 --> 01:31:58,972
That reward money would rightfully be mine, y'know.

913
01:31:59,632 --> 01:32:01,172
But hey, I'm generous.

914
01:32:01,701 --> 01:32:03,803
I'll let you keep it just this one time.

915
01:32:38,565 --> 01:32:39,694
Where is he taking her?

916
01:32:44,294 --> 01:32:45,564
Away from here.

917
01:32:47,194 --> 01:32:47,814
Away

918
01:32:56,234 --> 01:32:57,424
Fly, COME ON!

919
01:33:04,605 --> 01:33:05,596
You can make it

920
01:33:07,565 --> 01:33:08,425
come on!

921
01:33:13,186 --> 01:33:14,206
Fly away ...

922
01:34:07,328 --> 01:34:12,178
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in this resting place to bid farewell to our sister.

923
01:34:13,328 --> 01:34:15,938
Into your gentle arms we commend her gracious spirit.

924
01:34:18,648 --> 01:34:22,139
Take her to yourself and give her safe haven.

925
01:34:23,249 --> 01:34:27,609
And though she struggled in life, now she knows your blessed peace.

926
01:34:29,089 --> 01:34:31,359
For all who question will find answers,

927
01:34:31,970 --> 01:34:37,889
and all who love will find contentment, joy, and peace eternal.

928
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:41,940
For now we see as through a glass darkly,

929
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,039
but then we shall see clearly, face to face.

930
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:53,180
Mister!

931
01:34:54,410 --> 01:34:54,940
Wait!

932
01:34:56,751 --> 01:34:57,820
Mister, WAIT!

933
01:34:59,910 --> 01:35:05,131
excuse me, sir, but...I was wondering if you knew my grandmother Leila.

934
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:12,631
Yes ... it's you, isn't it.

935
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:14,890
My grandmother told me about you,

936
01:35:15,141 --> 01:35:19,742
so...I'd be honored if you'd come to our house, my dad would be so happy

937
01:35:20,481 --> 01:35:21,051
please?

938
01:35:22,902 --> 01:35:24,632
I appreciate your kindness.

939
01:35:25,241 --> 01:35:27,952
Oh, c'mon. We don't live very far.

940
01:35:32,092 --> 01:35:35,332
I just came here to keep a promise to an old ... friend of mine.

941
01:35:37,392 --> 01:35:40,182
She was afraid no one would mourn her death.

942
01:35:40,672 --> 01:35:42,183
I'm glad she was so wrong.

943
01:35:42,732 --> 01:35:43,102
Huh?

944
01:35:43,713 --> 01:35:45,802
OK, I guess I see. .....

945
01:35:50,403 --> 01:35:52,773
Anyway, thank you for coming, sir.

946
01:36:03,333 --> 01:36:03,984
G'bye!

947
01:36:06,864 --> 01:36:07,434
G-bye!!

948
01:36:11,703 --> 01:36:13,384
Well, that was nice.

949
01:36:14,044 --> 01:36:15,974
You're not so bad after all.

950
01:36:17,654 --> 01:36:19,094
You just dress bad.
