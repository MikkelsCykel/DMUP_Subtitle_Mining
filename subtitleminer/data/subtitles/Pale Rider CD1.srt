00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,269
Look here!

2
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,188
Lindsey!

3
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,189
Megan!

4
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,908
Those sow-wallowing monkeys' asses.

5
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,318
''The Lord is my shepherd;
l shall not want.''

6
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,959
But l do want.

7
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,188
''He leadeth me beside still waters.

8
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,671
''He restoreth my soul.''

9
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,031
But they killed my dog.

10
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,356
''Yea, though l walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

11
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,556
"''...l shall fear no evil... ''"

12
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,352
"But l am afraid."

13
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,952
"''...for thou art with me..."

14
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,120
"''...thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. ''"

15
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,551
But we need a miracle.

16
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,989
"''Thy loving kindness and mercy..."

17
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,200
"''...shall follow me all the days of my life. ''"

18
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,073
lf you exist.

19
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,238
"''And l shall dwell in the house"
"of the Lord forever. ''"

20
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,238
But l'd like to get more out of this life first.

21
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,071
lf you don't help us...

22
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,472
...we're all going to die.

23
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,194
"Please?"

24
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,838
"Just one miracle?"

25
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,875
Amen.

26
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,192
Quitting, Mr. Barret?

27
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,150
No, Eddie, just going to town.

28
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,676
Ain't that kind of dumb?

29
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,954
You remember what happened
to you last time?

30
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,119
-You quitting, Mr. Barret?
-Just going to town.

31
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,232
Ain't that kind of dumb
after what happened last time?

32
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,429
lt's Barret.

33
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,998
Good afternoon, Mrs. B.

34
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,109
Damn fool!

35
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,190
At least wait till the smoke clears.

36
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,795
We seem to need a few supplies.

37
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,950
All new camp, the way l hear it.

38
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,709
You've got sand, boy,
but less sense than a sack of beans.

39
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,038
We've got no choice.
They ruined McPherson's shack.

40
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,874
Busted some others.
lf it snows, the children will get sick.

41
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,029
Go on!

42
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,398
l expect you'll pay for all of this
in gold, right?

43
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,798
When l put together a few ounces,
l'll bring them in.

44
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,431
lt'll take more than that.

45
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,557
Throw me that ledger!

46
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,631
The last payment you made...

47
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,555
...was eight months ago,
when Lindquist brought his dust in.

48
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,190
There's no color left in Carbon Creek.

49
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,510
Then why is LaHood driving us out?

50
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,910
He ain't used to being said no to.

51
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,914
There's color and nuggets.
Spider panned one out this morning.

52
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,828
Spider Conway? l've got that
son of a bitch down for $85.33.

53
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,517
Forty-three cents.
He wants cyanide to bleach his dust.

54
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,868
That tears it!

55
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,474
Tell Spider...

56
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,438
...and the others that this is the end
of the line.

57
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,479
The tit's gone dry!
No more credit, you hear?

58
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,472
You're a decent man.

59
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,195
We're grateful for what you've done.

60
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,392
Don't coddle me! l ain't doing this for you.

61
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,073
l'm the only merchant in town
LaHood doesn't own.

62
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,077
lt does my soul good
to see a few thorns in his side.

63
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,315
One day, when we strike it big,
l'll pay you off myself.

64
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,558
With interest, Mrs. B.

65
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,879
Just get your goods
in that wagon and skedaddle.

66
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,270
Keep moving no matter what they say.

67
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,398
You take care, Hull.

68
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,958
We got a beef with you.

69
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,672
When we rode through the canyon,
you didn't say hello.

70
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,757
Told you to stay out of town.

71
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,599
When l kicked your head,
it must've jarred your memory.

72
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,955
Kick him again, maybe it'll come back.

73
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,796
Tell us about your Wheeler women.
You humping just the growed one or both?

74
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,550
Probably both at the same time.

75
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,478
The little one is just out
of knickers, ain't she?

76
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,112
l'll bet she's as juicy as a freshwater clam.

77
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,909
What will make you fight like a man?

78
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,071
l didn't come here to fight.

79
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,958
Then you shouldn't have come.

80
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,077
You made a big mistake, tin pan.
You know that?

81
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,871
Can l take a look at your goods?

82
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,468
Leave them be.

83
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,196
Canvas, burlap and wood.

84
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,189
Looks like the makings of a good fire.

85
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,871
You shouldn't play with matches.

86
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,548
Goddamn!

87
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,754
There's nothing like a nice piece of hickory.

88
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,753
Much obliged.

89
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,231
Hull Barret's my name.

90
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,870
-You from hereabouts?
-Nope.

91
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,952
Just passing through?

92
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,798
l hadn't thought about it.

93
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,758
After what you did,
l wouldn't stay in town.

94
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,232
My cabin has two rooms.
You're welcome to one.

95
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,558
l wouldn't want to be a burden on you
or your family.

96
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,075
All l got is a kind of fiancée.

97
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,074
lt would be a pleasure, not a burden.

98
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,400
Three hots and a cot is the least l owe you.

99
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,030
-So long, Hull.
-Where you going?

100
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,112
Going. Getting out.

101
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,913
Where the hell to?

102
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,070
Away. Can't fight no more.

103
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,037
l'm not the only one.

104
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,837
Good luck. You'll quit, too, if you're smart.

105
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,189
"''And power was given to him that sat"

106

Here's a towel for you.

120
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,910
Dinner will be ready pretty soon.

121
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,275
You should have seen how he waded
into McGill and his men.

122
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,677
He sounds no different
than any of LaHood's men.

123
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,752
He wasn't afraid of them.

124
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,037
-We need someone they can't scare.
-You scared of them?

125
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,992
He should be.
But he's too all-fired stubborn.

126
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,349
l was scared and they knew it.
LaHood's got us all scared.

127
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,270
Lindquist left and didn't even know
where he was going.

128
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,518
''l'm just going,'' he said.

129
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,430
The colony is beaten.
The only one who doesn't know it is you.

130
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,956
And me! l'm not leaving
until LaHood's men are whipped.

131
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,559
Hush, Megan!

132
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,718
You got her talking more
like she's your daughter.

133
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,910
Tell her that fighting is nonsense.

134
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,039
Who's talking about fighting?

135
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,873
You, talking about this stranger!
ls he a gunman?

136
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,353
l hope so. l'd chip in an ounce of dust
for a little protection.

137
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,159
From a hired killer?

138
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,958
Who said he's a hired killer?

139
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,598
Megan, we're going home.

140
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,591
-Sarah, please.
-Get rid of him!

141
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,193
-l will.
-Today!

142
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,476
-Right after supper.
-No!

143
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,871
-Now!
-He saved my life.

144
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,400
l hope l'm not the cause of this excitement.

145
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,315
Do you mind?

146
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,113
Go right ahead.

147
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,989
There's nothing like a shot of whiskey...

148
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,031
...to whet a man's appetite.

149
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,518
Fine looking fricassee.

150
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,712
Don't want it to get cold.

151
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,599
l apologize.

152
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,559
l didn't realize....

153
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,353
l'll be damned.

154
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,110
Here, come right down here.

155
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,914
l'll get you some biscuits.
There's your stew, some butter and syrup.

156
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,992
You want anything else?

157
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,040
Just some company.
Aren't you joining me?

158
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,479
Of course!

159
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,559
How do you do?

160
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,630
Thank you for helping
on Hull's behalf this morning.

161
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,472
l'm Sarah Wheeler.

162
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,632
This is my daughter, Megan.

163
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,878
l guess we got carried away...

164
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,396
...but from the way you handled
those men, l never would have thought--

165
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,913
Will you say grace?

166
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,795
Certainly.

167
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,230
For what we are about to receive...

168
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,231
...may we be truly thankful.

169
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,991
-You should've started an hour ago.
-l apologize.

170
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,711
We'd have been here,
but we got tied up at the sawbone's.

171
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,237
What the hell happened?

172
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,631
We had a little set-in with Barret
in town, Boss.

173
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,755
And you got whipped?
ln LaHood, California, by a tin pan?

174
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,989
There was a stranger
who gave him a hand.

175
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,559
A big guy.

176
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,473
Who're you talking about?

177
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,438
He left with Barret.
We didn't stick around.

178
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,751
McGill, take the sluice.

179
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,913
Jagou, Tyson, Elam, take over the monitor.

180
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,275
This man, LaHood, he's the one
you all are feuding with?

181
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,876
Him and his son. Old Coy LaHood,
he's a powerful man.

182
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,112
He came up here in '54 or '55,
l think it was.

183
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,870
He was the first to strike it rich.

184
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,193
He saved himself a poke, then he'd stake
new claims and mine them out...

185
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,752
...then buy some more. Lately,
he's been using big hydraulic monitors.

186
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,918
They blast a place to hell.
Excuse my French.

187
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,269
LaHood's more powerful now than ever.

188
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,637
Carbon Canyon's the only place
he hasn't ruined.

189
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,518
He's greedy for it, too.

190
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,029
Does he have any rights to your canyon?

191
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,668
No, our claims are filed in Sacramento.

192
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,033
The only way LaHood can take
this land legally is if we leave it.

193
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,429
l take it he's been kind of persuasive.

194
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,631
l don't care if they all leave, l'm staying.
He killed my dog and Grandpa.

195
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,557
lsn't there any law around
to take your case to?

196
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,110
lf there was, LaHood would own them
like he owns everything.

197
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,437
And there's not much a lawman could do
even if we had one.

198
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,716
LaHood ain't killed anyone yet.

199
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,230
Meg's grandpa's heart gave out.

200
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,870
l've been taking care of Sarah
and Megan ever since.

201
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,150
lt ain't that we're living in sin...

202
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,796
...or that l won't marry her.

203
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,118
But one day, a few years back,
her husband...

204
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,590
...Megan's father, lit out on her...

205
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,551
...and left her with a child.

206
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,073
And since then, getting her trustful
of a man hasn't been easy.

207
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,319
But when we do get hitched,
will you do it?

208
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,871
lf you're waiting for a woman to make up
her mind, you may have a long wait.

209
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,832
Yeah, l guess so.

210
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,400
Meantime, why don't you put me to work?

211
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,915
No, l couldn't ask you to....

212
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,478
Maybe something spiritual.

213
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,434
That spirit ain't worth spit
without a little exercise. Tell me where.

214
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,235
Well, okay.

215
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,755
l always thought that
if l could split that rock there...

216
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,516
...and get to the gravel underneath,
there's gold been waiting there forever.

217
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,758
Every morning for two years,
l've been coming out here, and you see...

218
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,275
...it's like this rock and me
have kind of an agreement.

219
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,078
l'm going to do it in,
or it's going to do me in.

220
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,679
l'd hate to lay odds on who's going to win.

221
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,472
l thought of drilling and blasting
the son of a gun, but that would--

222
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,951
-Wreck the stream?
-Dam it up, be the end of everything.

223
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,072
There's few problems can't be solved
with a little sweat and hard work.

224
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,512
Somebody's coming.

225
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,552
You recognize them?

226
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,920
The one on the left is LaHood's boy, Josh.

227
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,832
The other one...

228
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,029
...l ain't never seen him before.

229
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,998
Friend of yours, Barret?

230
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,951
Yep. He's our new preacher.

231
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,515
l hear you messed up some of my boys.

232
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,113
Nothing personal.

233
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,115
Don't you take it personal,
but get the hell out of Carbon Canyon.

234
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,674
There's a lot of sinners hereabouts.

235
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,793
l shouldn't leave before l finish my work.

236
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,630
Jesus!

237
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,557
Your work done now, Preacher?

238
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,678
Part of it, leastways.

239
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,633
Put it in a little ice, that'll take care of it.

240
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,591
Thanks for stopping by, son.

241
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,438
You think you can make it?

242
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,509
lce!

243
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,117
The Lord certainly does work
in mysterious ways.

244
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,679
Preacher, my ass!

245
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,748
Watch that step!

246
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,877
Why? Damn thing move
since we left Sacramento?

247
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,679
-Thank you, Mr. LaHood.
-Welcome home, Pop.

248
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,468
How was Sacramento?

249
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,552
Paradise! Two politicians
for every Chinese laundry...

250
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,229
...and two whores for every politician.

251
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,154
lf there was gold in the delta,
l'd go there. How's business?

252
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,638
We're pulling low-grade ore out
of number five, but it's about played out.

253
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,112
We went down 20 feet more in 12 shaft,
got only manganite, and shut it down.

254
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,637
And that vein in Cobalt Canyon
is wearing thin, too.

255
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,713
What about Carbon?

256
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,352
We ran another raid through there
a few days back and scared them good.

257
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,436
We damn near run them out,
lock, stock, and barrel.

258
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,637
Seems a stranger came through
and pulled them together.

259
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,313
Ain't that right?

260
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,950
Yeah, he pulled them together.

261
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,350
This one stranger did that?

262
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,115
l expect you boys didn't explain to him
just who we are.

263
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,958
l expect that once you explain things
to him, he'll decide to move on!

264
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,032
There ain't much for a preacher
to do here, right?

265
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,275
You let a preacher into Carbon Canyon?

266
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,318
We didn't invite him! He took up with Hull.

267
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,077
What's wrong with a preacher?

268
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,072
When l left, those tin pans
had all but given up.

269
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,316
Their spirit was nearly broken.

270
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,710
And a man without spirit is whipped.

271
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,638
But a preacher, he could give them faith.

272
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,316
Shit! One ounce of faith, they'll be dug
in deeper than ticks on a hound.

273
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,989
You boys throw a rope around that man.
You bring him to me!

274
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,959
No, don't.

275
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,518
lf we get too rough, we'll make a martyr
out of him. Don't want that.

276
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,832
-That's true.
-You didn't get no help from Sacramento?

277
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,749
Sacramento ain't worth moose piss!

278
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,231
They didn't sign the writ?

279
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,833
Not only that...

280
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,951
...some of them bastard politicians
want to do away with hydraulic mining.

281
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,229
''Raping the land,'' they call it.

282
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,996
We got to move on Carbon,
and move fast and dig deep.

283
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,433
Because the way the wind's blowing,
we may be out of business soon.

284
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,309
And those tin pans have got to go!

285
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,393
And that preacher!

286
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,873
We'll have to find a way to deal with him.

287
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,194
Were Grandma and Grandpa happy
when you got married?

288
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,716
They didn't have a thimbleful of choice
in the matter.

289
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,072
Were they surprised?

290
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,437
Grandpa took the measles,
and Grandma got drunk.

291
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,319
l suppose you could say
it surprised them some.

292
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,790
Because they thought
you weren't old enough?

293
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,553
Your grandma was 15
when she got married.

294
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,072
No, l think what riled them
was who l married.

295
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,590
Will you be happy married to Hull?

296
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,312
Who says l'm marrying Hull?

297
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,437
He's nice enough, isn't he?

298
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,509
Yes.

299
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,909
He's nice.

300
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,432
Do preachers get married?

301
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,592
l don't see why not.

302
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,074
How do l look?

303
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,232
You look lovely.

304
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,350
You are the prettiest daughter...

305
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,357
...l could ever have.

306
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,879
Break your hand?

307
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,350
lt's a nugget! The biggest damn nugget
l've ever seen.

308
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,671
Look here. Look at that!

309
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,476
lsn't that beautiful?
Almost as beautiful as Sarah.

310
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,118
Yeah, it figures.

311
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,430
lt came from underneath that boulder.

312
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,954
l was right.

313
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,634
l was right.

314
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,316
lt must weigh four oz.
That's a quarter pound of gold.

315
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,874
ls that real?

316
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,031
Real? Just look at it.

317
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,433
Let's celebrate.

318
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,159
Can we go into town?

319
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,510
l don't think that's a very good idea.

320
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,149
That would clear your credit, wouldn't it?

321
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,196
lt would, and then some.

322
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,073
Can we, please?

323
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,959
What do you think?

324
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,948
Why not? We've got as much right in town
as the next person.

325
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,718
Going to town again?

326
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,110
That's right. Want to come along?

327
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,398
No, our daddy wouldn't let us go to town.

328
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,870
Sure is a nice day for it, though.

329
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,837
l'll be back. l'll go square things
with Mr. Blankenship.

330
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,474
-Take care of the ladies.
-That won't be hard.

331
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,551
We'll get a soda after l'm done.

332
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,195
Look.

333
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,189
-l'll go get Hull.
-That's all right.

334
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,273
He'll be fine.

335
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,910
My papa wants to see you, Preacher.

336
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,353
He does, does he?

337
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,629
All right.

338
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,471
Don't go. l know it's a trick.

339
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,232
l'll be all right.

340
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,551
-What if they hurt him?
-Shut up.

341
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,559
l'm sorry.

342
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,073
lt's all right.

343
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,149
Preacher, my name is Coy LaHood.

344
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,155
l know.

345
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,636
Do you imbibe, Reverend?

346
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,311
Only after 9:00 in the morning.

347
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,154
When l heard a parson had come to town...

348
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,273
...l had an image of a pale, scrawny,
Bible-thumping Easterner...

349
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,119
...with a linen handkerchief and bad lungs.

350
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,555
That's me.

351
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,794
Hardly.

352
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,989
Your health.

353
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,116
lt occurred to me it must be difficult
for a man of faith...

354
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,591
...to carry the message
on an empty stomach, so to speak.

355
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,829
l thought...

356
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,833
...why not invite this devout
and humble man to preach in town?

357
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,032
Why not let the town be his parish?
ln fact...

358
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,269
...why not build him a brand-new church?

359
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,594
l can see where a preacher'd be
mighty tempted by an offer like that.

360
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,154
Oh, indeed.

361
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,754
Then he'd be thinking about getting himself
a batch of new clothes.

362
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,752
We'd have them tailor-made.

363
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,712
Then he'd start thinking
about those Sunday collections.

364
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,072
Hell, in a town as rich as LaHood,
that preacher'd be a wealthy man.

365
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,591
That's why it wouldn't work.

366
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,950
Can't serve God and mammon both.
Mammon being money.

367
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,478
l opened this country.

368
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,438
l made this town what it is.

369
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,636
l brought jobs and industry.

370
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,593
l built an empire with my own two hands.

371
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,834
And l've never asked help of anyone.

372
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,833
Those squatters, Reverend,
are standing in the way of progress.

373
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,352
Theirs or yours?

374
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,434
Here, look. Just look at that writ!

375
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,351
Comes hot from Sacramento, giving me
mineral rights to the whole canyon.

376
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,598
That hardly seems likely. lf you had
those rights, you'd have exercised them.

377
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,317
No, those people have legal claims.
You can't mine there till they leave.

378
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,512
Damn it! You read that writ!

379
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,354
lf it was worth the paper it's on,
you wouldn't be trying to bribe me.

380
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,516
What's your business
with those tin pans, Reverend?

381
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,276
Nothing. They're just friends.

382
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,675
You and your friends got 24 hours
to pack up and leave...

383
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,991
...or my men will ride through that canyon
and run you out!

384
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,273
l've been a law-abiding man,
but now l'm out of patience.

385
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,352
And any blood that gets spilled
will be on your hands.

386
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,749
You're a troublemaker, stranger.

387
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,879
You spell bad cess in letters
that stretch from here to Seattle.

388
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,037
Thanks for the drink.

389
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,553
Now, l've reasoned and l've bargained
with you and l've come up short.

390
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,874
But what's mine is mine,
and if you make me fight for it, l will.

391
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,956
There is a man, a marshal.

392
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,758
He keeps the peace, if you take
my meaning. His name is Stockburn.

393
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,670
And he won't be as patient as me.

394
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,758
These people in Carbon Canyon,
would you pay cash for their claims?

395
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,754
Buy them out?

396
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,714
l'd do anything to prevent bloodshed.
How about $100 a head?

397
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,079
How about $1,000?

398
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,113
l'll tell you what: l'll go up to $125.

399
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,030
Stockburn and his deputies
will cost you a lot more than that.

400
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,273
How would you know?

401
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,439
How much is it worth
to have a clear conscience?

402
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,351
$1,000 per claim then.

403
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,548
But l want them out of here in 24 hours!

404
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,479
l paid him off in full. l even have enough
to pay off Sparters.

405
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,639
Where is he?

406
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,594
ln there.

407
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,831
Well, do something, Hull!

408
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,752
What were you doing in there?

409
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,717
LaHood was buying me a drink.

410
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,718
Thanks for the thought.

411
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,112
So we all vote in favor?

412
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,150
Speak up! All those in favor?

413
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,392
Are any opposed?

414
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,392
Me and LaHood's seen a lot of ground
together, starting back in '55.

415
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,109
He may be greedy, but he ain't no fool.

416
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,879
lf he offers $1,000 a claim,
it's because it's worth five times that.

417
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,833
The way LaHood works, maybe.
The way we work...

418
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,554
...we're lucky to see $1,000 a year.

419
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,436
l say we take his offer.

420
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,199
Suppose you struck a thousand bucks
in nuggets.

421
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,432
Would you quit and blow town?
Or keep digging?

422
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,318
What do you say, Preacher?

423
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,437
What l say doesn't matter.
lt's your sweat he's buying.

424
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,870
Why don't you sleep on it,
make the decision in the morning?

425
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,639
What if we don't decide in the morning?
What happens if we can't decide?

426
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,878
Then l suppose LaHood'll take that as no.

427
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,715
Then what?

428
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,430
He said he'd call in a marshal.

429
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,831
What kind of a threat is that?

430
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,710
We have nothing to fear from the law.

431
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,910
This is no ordinary kind of marshal.

432
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,678
His name is Stockburn.
He travels with six deputies.

433
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,919
And they uphold whatever law
pays them the most.

434
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,436
Killing is a way of life with them.
l'm telling you this...

435
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,189
...because if you decide against
LaHood's offer, you'll meet him.

436
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,916
You know this Stockburn?

437
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,913
l've heard of him.

438
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,794
We all know what we're up against.

439
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,032
He ain't just saying, ''Take my offer.''
He's saying, ''Take it or else.''

440
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,079
We're family men.
We're no match for seven guns.

441
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,393
Yeah, but how many of us are there?
Twenty?

442
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,191
l heard the preacher.
l know these men are professionals.

443
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,039
But it's still twenty against seven, ain't it?

444
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,438
And we know how to pull
a damn trigger, don't we?

445
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:31,273
lf it comes down to it,
l'll fight before l'll quit my claim...

446
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,709
...but, damn it, LaHood's offer's fair.

447
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,396
l still vote we take his money
and we start afresh elsewhere.

448
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,352
Starting fresh sounds good
when you're in trouble...

449
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,838
...but before we vote to pack up
and leave...

450
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,629
...l think we should ask why we're here.

451
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,032
lf it's no more than money,
then we're no better than LaHood himself.

452
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,551
Spider here asked a question.

453
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,872
lf any of us turned up $1,000 worth
of nuggets, would he quit? Hell, no!

454
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,509
He'd build his family a better house...

455
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,434
...and buy his kids better clothes...

456
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,718
...maybe build a school...

457
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,754
...or a church.

458
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,039
lf we were farmers, we'd be planting crops.

459
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,158
lf we raised cattle, we'd tend them.
But we're miners...

460
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,151
...so we dig and pan...

461
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,512
...and break our backs for gold.

462
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,195
But gold ain't what we're about.
lt ain't what l'm about.

463
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,356
l came out here to raise a family.
This is my home.

464
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,033
This is my dream. l've sunk roots here.

465
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:40,354
And we all have buried members
of our families in this ground.

466
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,918
And this is their dream, too,
and they died for it.

467
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,915
Now we're going to take $1,000
and leave their graves untended?

468
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,272
We owe them more than that.

469
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,551
We owe ourselves more.

470
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,917
lf we sell out now...

471
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,999
...what price do we put
on our dignity next time?

472
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,594
$2,000?

473
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,555
Less?

474
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,592
Or just the best offer?

475
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,196
l say to hell with LaHood!

476
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,436
l ain't a brave man,
but l ain't no coward neither.

477
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,671
We took our chances this far.

478
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,273
l vote we keep it up.

479
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,399
To hell with LaHood!

480
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,669
Let them come!

481
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,394
We're ready!

482
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,351
l buried my dog over here.

483
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,910
That's hallowed ground then.

484
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,872
l said a prayer for her.

485
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,272
lt was after the raid.

486
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,152
l prayed for a miracle.

487
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,029
Maybe someday you'll get that miracle.

488
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,397
lt was the day you arrived.

489
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,832
l think l love you.

490
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,911
There's nothing wrong with that.

491
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,589
lf there was more love in the world...

492
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,553
...there'd probably be a lot less dying.

493
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,355
Then there can't be anything wrong
with making love either.

494
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,790
l think it's best just to...

495
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,637
...practice loving before you think
about the other.

496
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,798
lf l practice just loving for a while,
will you teach me the other?

497
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,592
Megan, most folks around...

498
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,269
...kind of associate that with marriage.

499
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,950
l'll be fifteen next month.
