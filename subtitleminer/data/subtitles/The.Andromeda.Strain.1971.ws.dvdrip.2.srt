32
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,460
<i>No, don't do that.</i> <i>We'll use the hands.</i>

33
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,670
Nothing can happen, sir. I'm faster than the hands.

34
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,720
I want you out of the hot room.

35
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,690
<i>B.Z. Doris to I.Z. Alice.</i>

36
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,070
<i>S.D.T. energy output</i> <i>is 1.8 to 3.0 joules...</i>

37
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,920
<i>with rate</i> <i>two to three milliradians.</i>

38
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,190
<i>And we still need</i> <i>those blankets.</i>

39
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,520
No sweat, sir. Those cages are airtight.

40
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,440
I wish you would sweat a little more, Toby.

41
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,770
Sweat is a safeguard against some kinds of bacteria and carelessness.

42
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,980
Use the hands.

43
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,600
Wow!

44
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,660
Transmitted by air, as we thought.

45
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,250
Now we've got to determine its size.

46
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,590
Could be a gas or some kind of a virus.

47
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,300
<i>We'll use a hundred</i> <i>angstrom filter to begin.</i>

48
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,410
About the size of a small virus.

49
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,870
All systems go, sir.

50
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,390
Whatever it is, it's larger than a virus.

51
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,320
We'll try a one micron filter.

52
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,360
Hang in there, baby.

53
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,960
He must be pretty big. I'm gonna get me a fly swatter.

54
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,650
Do that. Here goes with two microns.

55
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,630
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

56
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,600
Nasty.

57
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,080
At least we'll be able to get a good look at it. Dutton to Stone.

58
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,860
We've just found out its size: about two microns in diameter.

59
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,770
Big enough to be a complete cell. Interesting.

60
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,320
There's a good chance it's alive. Airborne transmission?

61
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,530
Yes. What have you found?

62
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,150
So far nothing. Our Nobel laureate here...

63
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,710
won't scan on the inside because he says... All right, Ruth.

64
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,310
Thanks, Charlie. Keep at it.

65
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,940
It's pointless to go on scanning outside.

66
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,640
If it's two microns in diameter, it would've showed up at 440.

67
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,260
True, but we didn't know that before, did we?

68
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,790
We'll start with five power on the inside.

69
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,850
Stick to established procedure. Establishment gonna fall down and go boom.

70
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,290
Switch to manual, Ruth. The interior's too irregular...

71
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,140
<i>to probe on automatic.</i>

72
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,380
More light, huh?

73
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,830
Here's his blood value now.

74
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,460
Half normal. Severely anemic.

75
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,950
Wake up, sir.

76
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,070
Can you hear me?

77
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,050
What's your name?

78
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,220
J-Jackson. What?

79
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,990
Jackson.

80
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,640
Stay awake, Mr. Jackson.

81
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,470
Stay awake!

82
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,710
Tongue blade.

83
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,880
<i>Sixty-eight degrees</i> <i>on 1-4-0-7.</i>

84
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,600
<i>Sixty-one</i> <i>on 1-2-0-3.</i>

85
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,460
<i>Loss rate is minus 0-0-12.</i>

86
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,800
<i>Please copy and confirm</i> <i>all receiving locks.</i>

87
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,270
<i>You can tell you're a bachelor.</i> What was that?

88
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,930
I didn't say anything.

89
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,570
We're doing an isotope scan.

90
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,000
How the bugs get into the body. Thought you should watch it.

91
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,930
I assume it was inhaled. Not likely it's absorbed through the skin.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,350
That's what we'll find out now: the mechanism of death.

93
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,770
<i>We'll look at a replay of that</i> <i>at speed 6.</i>

94
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,590
<i>That tells us what</i> <i>we want to know, Hall.</i>

95
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,600
<i>The organism is inhaled.</i>

96
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,880
<i>The clotting begins in the lungs</i> <i>and spreads outward.</i>

97
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,990
I didn't think it possible.

98
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,160
I didn't think the total volume of blood could solidify that fast.

99
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,940
I hoped maybe one crucial clot might form in the brain, which was what made them go insane,

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,110
and then the rest of the blood clot more slowly.

101
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,030
We'd have a chance to cure that.

102
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,400
Cure what? We don't know what it is.

103
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,330
Stone and Leavitt haven't been able to isolate the hellish thing.

104
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,790
Of course they will in time.

105
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,410
<i>Of course.</i>

106
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,170
<i>Hold it.</i>

107
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,580
<i>At the edge of that shadow,</i> <i>I think...</i>

108
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,680
<i>Me too.</i>

109
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,910
<i>It's an indentation.</i>

110
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,010
<i>Yes, about the size</i> <i>of a pencil point.</i>

111
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,930
<i>Go to 40.</i>

112
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,170
<i>Go to 60.</i>

113
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,300
<i>Jeremy,</i> <i>do you think maybe...</i>

114
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,080
<i>Maybe it's just</i> <i>a grain of sand.</i>

115
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,210
<i>Go to 80.</i>

116
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,130
<i>What about</i> <i>the bits of green?</i>

117
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,020
<i>Paint.</i> <i>For God's sake!</i>

118
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,510
<i>Pistachio ice cream!</i> <i>There's no basis to assume</i> <i>it's anything yet.</i>

119
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,650
You're too good a scientist not to be thinking the same thing I am.

120
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,540
<i>If this is really something new,</i> <i>some brand-new form of life...</i>

121
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,980
The best hope of cracking it is to be grindingly thorough...

122
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,010
with the help of computer number one.

123
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,320
<i>Okay?</i> <i>Now let's get on with it.</i>

124
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,510
<i>Hold it.</i>

125
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,940
More pistachio?

126
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,110
<i>I count four patches.</i>

127
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,430
Keep going. I'll computerize the coordinates.

128
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,890
Let's take a look at the rock at 100.

129
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,170
<i>I doubt that's what knocked</i> <i>the capsule off trajectory.</i>

130
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,480
Unless the rock was going at tremendous speed,

131
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,270
or unless it's terribly heavy.

132
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,350
For Pete's sake, Ruth, it can't be that heavy.

133
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,310
Hall and I could lift the capsule.

134
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,790
However, it's possible the rock is different in space; out there it might do anything.

135
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,760
Maybe it has elastic properties we don't even know yet.

136
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,840
Let's have a look at the green patches.

137
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,010
They must've come off the rock,

138
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,990
if it is rock.

139
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,790
You know something?

140
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,540
They do look like spatters of paint.

141
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,120
Let's go back to the rock and see it at 440.

142
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,910
<i>If that's a meteor,</i> <i>it's a damn peculiar one.</i>

143
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,310
This left border over here,

144
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,370
it's smooth, almost like an artificial surface.

145
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,290
Painted, maybe. Luminous paint.

146
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,620
If I keep watching it, I might think so.

147
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,790
Wet paint sign and all.

148
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,120
Jeremy? <i>What?</i>

149
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Nothing.

150
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,750
You okay?

151
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,050
It's just my eyes are tired. We've been at it five hours straight.

152
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,970
We'll take a caffeine break in a minute.

153
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,680
First I'd like to see one of the separate patches of green at 1,000.

154
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,980
<i>Did you see that?</i> <i>I saw it.</i>

155
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,670
You didn't change the lighting? <i>I didn't touch it.</i>

156
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,950
<i>Looks alive.</i> <i>Yes.</i>

157
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,840
<i>It's bigger</i> <i>than two microns.</i>

158
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,900
Which means the infection is spread by a mere fraction of the green.

159
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,690
I'm bringing down cameras.

160
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,620
Let's have the other microscanner.

161
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,600
Stone to Level Control. I need a Mic-T. <i>Roger. Will send.</i>

162
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,210
<i>Jump it up to 1500.</i>

163
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,390
Microscan doesn't go any higher.

164
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,360
We can get 1500 light magnification in microchemistry.

165
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,380
I'll send the rock through.

166
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,480
<i>Attention C.L.T.s</i> <i>on levels 4 and 5.</i>

167
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,790
<i>Main computer shows capacity</i> <i>versus access time...</i>

168
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,230
<i>at ten to the twelfth bits.</i>

169
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,750
<i>For any change</i> <i>in memory configuration,</i>

170
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,230
<i>C.L.T.s must check</i> <i>their unicom op.</i>

171
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,590
<i>Beautiful, sir.</i>

172
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,670
I'm the Mic-T. You're real sharp on the hands.

173
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,260
Thanks. Nice to know one hasn't lost one's touch.

174
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,190
The next step is to find out what makes it grow.

175
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,320
We'll need samples from the scoop to send through maxcult for culture and isolation.

176
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,490
Roger, sir. In work.

177
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,470
<i>Good God!</i>

178
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,550
It's growing.

179
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,700
<i>Not so good.</i>

180
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,410
<i>Naturally he has acidosis.</i> <i>His blood pH was</i> <i>nine points off normal.</i>

181
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,500
But why? Stupid machine! What makes his blood too acid?

182
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,740
Ask the patient.

183
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,010
<i>Bio-safety to S.L.,</i> <i>sectors 3 and 6.</i>

184
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,350
<i>Give us a code 3</i> <i>when you get it.</i>

185
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,670
Mr. Jackson?

186
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,260
Now, don't be scared. I'm a doctor.

187
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,640
Bull.

188
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,030
Where am I?

189
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,820
A special laboratory in Nevada.

190
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,980
We brought you here from Piedmont. You're sick.

191
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,270
It's this damn stomach of mine.

192
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,500
Bleeding? Hell, yes, bleeding!

193
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,910
Bleeding in your stomach? You have an ulcer?

194
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,580
Damn tootin'. Two years.

195
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,140
But you must have pain. What do you do for it?

196
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,200
Aspirin...

197
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,180
and squeeze.

198
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,380
Squeeze? What's that? Ain't gonna tell ya.

199
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,130
So you're a Sterno drinker, huh?

200
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,050
Works good.

201
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,040
Give him squeeze.

202
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,260
What's the baby's name, Mr. Jackson?

203
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,510
- You the nurse? - Uh-huh.

204
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,480
Shoot!

205
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,400
Can't see your legs.

206
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,440
Do you know the baby's name?

207
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,750
Give us a butt first.

208
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,720
Smoking isn't allowed here.

209
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,340
Then go fish.

210
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,240
Yeah. When you're finished,

211
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,350
we'll transfuse Jackson and start ice water lavage.

212
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,910
He has a two-year history of bleeding ulcers.

213
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,240
You seem delighted. It may be the reason he survived.

214
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,500
If only our young gourmet weren't so normal.

215
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,250
Well, let's hope nothing changes that.

216
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,420
We might have to before this is over.

217
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,670
They should've dropped the bomb.

218
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,970
They should've dropped it two days ago, General.

219
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,040
This Phantom crashed a good 60 miles beyond the cordoned area.

220
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,280
Men on the ground can't cordon off airspace, sir.

221
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,420
I just don't understand why the Wildfire Team...

222
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,520
hasn't beefed about the delay in 7-12.

223
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
It's been almost 24 hours, and not a word from them.

224
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,120
I don't think Piedmont had anything to do with this crash, Manchek.

225
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,560
It was a fluke.

226
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,170
That plane was only over the W.F. area for two minutes at 23,000 feet.

227
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,570
It's a routine training mission accident, I bet you.

228
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,420
Pilot error. Let's go.

229
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,070
Check with Wildfire Message Center, Delta Five.

230
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,990
Make sure everything there is nominal.

231
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,470
Send me word on scrambler at Big Head crash base. Okay.

232
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,370
Checklim program completed. All circuit banks nominal.

233
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,790
Same thing on the M.C.N. console, Captain.

234
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,570
<i>Just a minute, Dr. Robertson.</i>

235
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,860
<i>You're saying Stone's</i> <i>$90 million facility,</i> <i>which you recommended,</i>

236
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,420
<i>was knocked out</i> <i>by a sliver of paper?</i>

237
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,140
<i>You tell that</i> <i>to the taxpayers!</i>

238
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,110
<i>These were highly-trained</i> <i>electronics men, Senator,</i>

239
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,190
<i>looking for</i> <i>an electronic fault.</i>

240
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,460
<i>The trouble was</i> <i>purely mechanical</i> <i>of the simplest kind.</i>

241
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,180
<i>But for them, it was like</i> <i>trying to see an elephant</i> <i>through a microscope.</i>

242
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,130
<i>The sliver had peeled</i> <i>from the roll...</i>

243
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,130
<i>and wedged between the bell</i> <i>and striker, preventing the bell</i> <i>from ringing.</i>

244
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,010
I'm convinced we're being held incommunicado.

245
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,980
Very flattering. We don't know much more than when we got here.

246
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,910
We know about Scoop now.

247
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,200
It's possible what Scoop found was no accident.

248
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,300
I suspect they were looking for the ultimate biological weapon.

249
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:13,840
Sounds like you're getting a little paranoid in this fun house.

250
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,140
What does Stone think... about the ultimate weapon, I mean?

251
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,850
We've isolated the organism.

252
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,090
It's in microchemistry.

253
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,580
We'll show you. <i>Watchdog to electrical support...</i>

254
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,890
All right, Lieutenant.

255
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,530
Albuquerque Center, this is Air Force 561.

256
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,190
Go ahead 561. My air hose is coming apart...

257
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,110
like it's dissolving!

258
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,760
Everything made of rubber is coming apart!

259
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,580
I feel funny.

260
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,780
It's a fluke, a vibration effect maybe.

261
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,090
Let's get up there.

262
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,390
Has Wildfire been informed? You mean the germ people?

263
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,100
It went out to them on the scrambler an hour ago. This they can't ignore.

264
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,400
<i>I.B. control</i> <i>to cafeteria level 3.</i>

265
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,470
<i>Number 4 Charlie hatch</i> <i>shows condition blue.</i>

266
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,890
<i>Alter responsivity characteristics</i> <i>until you get condition green.</i>

267
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,730
Ready.

268
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,900
<i>Nothing so unusual</i> <i>about our rock after all.</i>

269
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,480
<i>Hydrogen, carbon, oxygen,</i> <i>sulfur, silicon, et cetera.</i>

270
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,390
Except the black rock isn't rock at all.

271
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,560
It's some kind of material similar to plastic.

272
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,330
How about that?

273
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,250
<i>The green is even simpler.</i>

274
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,130
<i>Hydrogen, carbon,</i> <i>nitrogen and oxygen.</i>

275
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,100
The four basic elements of life on Earth, nothing else.

276
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,030
That's a relief.

277
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,840
I'd have been happier if it'd turned out not to be alive.

278
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,700
<i>Green stuff, you really</i> <i>had us going for a while.</i>

279
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,750
A.A. analysis results are ready, Dr. Dutton.

280
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,670
<i>Something's wrong.</i> <i>It's not registering.</i>

281
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,500
Yes it is, sir.

282
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,340
<i>It's just registering</i> <i>double-zero, double-zero.</i>

283
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,890
We'll switch to computerized analysis.

284
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,870
<i>No amino acids!</i>

285
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,030
<i>No proteins, no enzymes,</i> <i>no nucleic acid.</i>

286
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,390
Impossible! No organism can maintain life without them!

287
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,560
You mean, no Earth organism.

288
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,810
It must have evolved in a totally different way.

289
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,130
You got it. It doesn't come from here.

290
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,910
Without chemical reactions there can't be life,

291
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,350
yet it grows, reproduces... <i>Wait!</i>

292
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,350
The infection at Piedmont has been stopped by the bomb.

293
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,800
We're secure at Wildfire. We have everything we need to achieve a breakthrough.

294
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,120
All we have to do is attack this problem like any other in science.

295
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,380
<i>You could spend years</i> <i>working on a thing like that</i> <i>without solving its structure.</i>

296
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,730
But when you do, there'll be some red faces around. It could change everything.

297
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,180
Great.

298
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,090
Ruth, since Kirke isn't here, you take over the growth program in microbiology.

299
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,380
We're halfway home if we find out what will keep that from growing.

300
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,960
Charlie, you work with me on the E.M. Hall... <i>All right.</i>

301
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,960
Let me get back to my patients. I'm sure they were protected by the same thing:

302
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,970
some simple mechanism I just don't recognize yet.

303
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,460
There's got to be something that the old man and baby have in common.

304
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,390
<i>Oh, Hall?</i>

305
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,550
Five minutes. You told me before.

306
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,060
Yes, we wouldn't want you to get too far from the substation now.

307
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,680
<i>Men, keep a sharp eye open</i> <i>for pieces of rubber.</i>

308
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,360
<i>I'll repeat that for you.</i> <i>Keep a sharp eye open</i> <i>for pieces of rubber.</i>

309
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,360
Major! Major Manchek!

310
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,360
Take a look at that, sir.

311
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,840
We just found this, General. It's a human bone.

312
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,490
Arm, I think.

313
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,600
It looks picked clean, almost like it was polished.

314
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,350
That's right. Well, I don't get it.

315
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,200
There is no actual rubber on the Phantom F-4, General.

316
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:50,810
It's all a synthetic plastic compound called polycron.

317
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,940
It has some of the characteristics of human skin.

318
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,870
What the hell is that?

319
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,580
What's left of his oxygen mask. It's made of polycron.

320
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,330
I'd say it was done by a chemical reaction of some sort.

321
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,660
Or maybe a microorganism. Meaning?

322
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,960
Meaning there was something in that plane that consumes plastic.

323
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,280
How's Maxcult coming, Ruth?

324
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,730
Will you be finished by the midnight conference? Easy.

325
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,740
Good. You can give us the results then.

326
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,870
Feeling better, aren't you, Mr. Jackson?

327
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,790
Yep!

328
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,620
Do you always have to wear that iron suit?

329
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,580
Yep!

330
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,710
Maybe you'll tell us the baby's name now, Mr. Jackson.

331
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,770
Manuel Rios. Mex.

332
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,980
Real little heller.

333
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,440
Squalls mornin', noon and night.

334
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,550
Neighbors wouldn't let 'em keep their windows open.

335
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,190
Do you sleep with your window closed?

336
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,840
No sirree, Bob.

337
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,800
Fresh air fiend.

338
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,450
Tell us what happened, Mr. Jackson.

339
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,940
I don't want to think about it.

340
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,430
You know what people will say?

341
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,730
Piedmont was bad. That's why it was punished.

342
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:45,720
<i>First the town went crazy</i> <i>and then was destroyed.</i>

343
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,640
You're crazy!

344
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,730
Folks at Piedmont was good, decent, normal folks.

345
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,280
The man we found dressed up in his doughboy's uniform, call that normal?

346
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,620
Pete Arnold, who worked at the store.

347
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,270
It was the disease. How do you know?

348
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,600
'Cause the only thing wrong with him before that night was sugar.

349
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,840
Diabetes? Did he take insulin?

350
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,240
A couple of times a day.

351
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,510
Hated the needle.

352
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,030
I tried to talk him into usin' squeeze.

353
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,630
Insulin. If he missed his treatment, he'd go...

354
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,570
Thanks, Mr. Jackson.

355
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,550
Oh, my God!

356
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,960
<i>Central C.C.</i> <i>to big P.C. control, all levels.</i>

357
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,040
<i>Testing laser system.</i>

358
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,500
<i>Please maintain</i> <i>random fringe drift...</i>

359
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,640
<i>within ten percent</i> <i>of initial value.</i>

360
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:40,050
<i>Dr. Leavitt, you have</i> <i>a midnight conference.</i> <i>The signal has struck twice.</i>

361
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,260
I heard!

362
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,670
I heard! I-I've been busy.

363
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,600
The important thing is something can slow it down.

364
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,030
I think it's some kind of blood disorder.

365
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,360
If the old soldier missed his insulin treatment, he'd go into acidosis.

366
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,980
The same as Jackson on Sterno.

367
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:09,240
I'll bet Leavitt finds the organism shows no growth on some of the blood cultures.

368
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:12,150
What's wrong with the baby's blood?

369
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,340
- Nothing... so far. - Then you're back where you started.

370
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,090
No. Somehow they're all interrelated.

371
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:24,180
I'll have the answer when I know why a 69-year-old Sterno drinker with an ulcer...

372
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,150
is like a normal six-month-old baby.

373
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,900
Did you get any no-growth readouts... No, but I'm not finished yet.

374
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,510
You told me you'd be finished. I decided to play part of it back.

375
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,900
- What for? The first time around should be... - Knock it off, Hall!

376
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,140
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

377
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,910
We're all tired.

378
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,780
Tired people make mistakes.

379
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,780
They draw wrong conclusions, they drop things.

380
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,090
That mustn't happen.

381
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,700
Starting now, I want the team to get six hours sleep out of every 24.

382
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,630
Suits me.

383
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,450
Before turning in, shouldn't we file for a code name?

384
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,730
Yeah, good idea.

385
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,410
<i>Nine over 4 over 8...</i>

386
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,340
<i>under 167.29.</i>

387
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,360
<i>Auto check in grade.</i>

388
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,320
<i>Auto check in grade.</i>

389
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,830
Why Andromeda? Andromeda's our...

390
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,750
Stone!

391
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,420
"Directive 7-12 has not been acted upon.

392
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,040
Alternative directive 7-11 now in effect."

393
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:05,420
They didn't drop the bomb! It's an M.C.N. transmission sent yesterday.

394
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,030
Idiots!

395
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,110
Put me through to Dr. Robertson.

396
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,860
In work, sir. Burke,

397
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,910
you didn't special alert an M.C.N. message to us.

398
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,880
There haven't been any, sir. The bell didn't ring...

399
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,290
Don't argue, damn it! I've got one in my hand.

400
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,270
Well, well. About time we heard from you.

401
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,390
There has been a communications foul-up. Never mind that now.

402
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,350
Why hasn't that bomb been dropped on Piedmont?

403
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:36,440
The decision on 7-12 isn't final. It was just postponed 48 hours.

404
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,190
By then the disease could spread into a worldwide epidemic.

405
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,900
It's because of rash statements like that the president doesn't trust scientists.

406
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,040
Warn the president it may already be too late.

407
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,700
Stay on his back, Robbie. You've got to make him call a 7-12.

408
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,040
Can you get me another appointment tonight, Grimes?

409
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,820
Now let's all just keep our heads screwed on.

410
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:56,150
Any thoughts about the Phantom crash?

411
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,030
We sent you a couple messages on it.

412
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,200
A Phantom jet strayed over the cordoned area around Piedmont.

413
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,660
- Any other information? - Well, the pilot said...

414
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,630
that all the rubber on the plane was dissolving.

415
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,590
His last communication was pretty weird.

416
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,440
- Like he was crazy? - He was mighty confused, that's for sure.

417
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,180
Robbie, it's your job to get the president to activate a 7-12 immediately.

418
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,450
If he doesn't, there's no guarantee anyone west of Piedmont will be alive in the morning.

419
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:22,380
Simmer down, Professor. I'll wake the boss.

420
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,730
But General Sparks says the crash was just a fluke.

421
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,930
Forget the crash, Robbie. Stay on that 7-12 and get back to me.

422
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,850
We'll be working around the clock.

423
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,950
<i>That's a good slice.</i> <i>It's too thick.</i>

424
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,920
<i>I'm setting it</i> <i>at 800 angstroms,</i>

425
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:15,510
and I'm going to a higher magnification.

426
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,940
<i>Now we're</i> <i>getting somewhere!</i>

427
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,350
<i>Yeah.</i> <i>But these can't be more</i> <i>than a few molecules in depth.</i>

428
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,250
<i>That's the one,</i> <i>that silver one.</i>

429
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,130
<i>This is a Villabach alert,</i> <i>all levels.</i>

430
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,080
<i>This is a Villabach alert.</i>

431
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:40,860
<i>Electromagnetic waves</i> <i>are not registering</i> <i>on the D.I.R.</i>

432
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,980
Sample in the button and sealed, Charlie. Start the vacuum pump.

433
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,080
Stone, can I see you?

434
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,030
I have the results of the growth cultures.

435
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,550
No, we can't leave now. We have an Andromeda cell in the E.M.

436
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,470
Okay, Charlie, let's put it on the screen.

437
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,910
Let's run it through the computer for contrast expansion.

438
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,950
Stone? What do you think?

439
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,380
<i>It looks like a crystal.</i>

440
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,790
- Well, gentlemen, there's our answer. - To what?

441
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,520
How Andromeda functions without amino acids.

442
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,560
Crystalline structure. Yes.

443
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,000
I've often thought that living matter...

444
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,490
might be based on crystals of some kind.

445
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,670
All these wedge-shaped compartments,

446
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,120
they'd serve to separate biochemical functions very well.

447
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,860
<i>It's dividing.</i>

448
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,390
In a vacuum, bombarded by electrons? It shouldn't even be alive!

449
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,760
That's what I wanted to tell you. The growth program...

450
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,930
shows Andromeda can live on anything.

451
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,210
Only gas and light affect it.

452
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:24,590
- You didn't get any no-growth results on the cultures? - None. Look.

453
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,510
The poorest growth occurs in pure oxygen...

454
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,070
<i>incubated under infrared light.</i>

455
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,790
Andromeda grows best in carbon dioxide and hydrogen...

456
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,710
<i>incubated under X rays.</i>

457
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,500
No excretions.

458
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:43,670
No waste of any kind. You'd expect that.

459
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,640
<i>Andromeda's perfect</i> <i>for existence in outer space.</i>

460
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,580
<i>Consumes everything,</i> <i>wastes nothing.</i>

461
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,440
Good Lord. Stone to Delta Five. Put me through to Robertson immediately.

462
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,360
What? God, I hope we're not too late.

463
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,430
- Tell me. - It functions like an atomic reactor.

464
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,410
An atomic blast could provide it with enough energy...

465
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,070
to grow into a gigantic supercolony. In one day.

466
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,130
You can relax now.

467
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,200
We've just left the president. He agreed to drop the bomb.

468
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,160
No, you've got to stop 7-12 from being carried out.

469
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,010
Now, wait a minute! We're not playing Ping-Pong.

470
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,270
We just got through telling the president... <i>For God's sake, go back!</i>

471
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,020
It grows when exposed to X rays or any source of energy.

472
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:27,320
Tell him no nuclear device must be detonated anywhere near it.

473
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,810
We just found out Andromeda works like a little reactor:

474
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,260
Converts matter to energy, energy to matter directly.

475
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,750
Then the bomb would only provide a fantastically rich growth medium. Understand?

476
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,370
No, but I'll pass along the recommendation.

477
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,300
The boss will be pleased to know...

478
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,880
that he made the right decision on 7-12 in the first place.

479
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,190
Congratulate him on his scientific insight.

480
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,010
<i>And, Robbie?</i>

481
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:53,240
You'd better get the atomic self-destruct in here disarmed as soon as possible.

482
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,990
Right. I'll start on the clearances now.

483
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,430
It'll be done by morning.

484
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:03,380
No, no, no. That won't work until the damn thing's going.

485
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,420
<i>All the molecules</i> <i>appear to be the same.</i>

486
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:33,790
<i>Yes.</i> <i>Andromeda isn't composed</i> <i>of different substances...</i>

487
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,740
<i>like a normal cell.</i>

488
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,870
All the subunits are the same.

489
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:42,140
Damndest thing I've ever s... Boy, a single substance.

490
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,540
<i>Then how the hell</i> <i>does it operate?</i>

491
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,730
<i>How does anything so simple</i> <i>utilize energy for growth?</i>

492
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,740
<i>No way of telling</i> <i>from that structure.</i>

493
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,020
Yes, there is. With this new data,

494
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,540
we can get a computerized version of how Andromeda functions.

495
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:06,550
They're not uniform. Could be mutations.

496
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,870
<i>What the devil?</i> <i>601?</i>

497
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:26,200
The computer's overloaded! Too much data coming in too fast.

498
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,080
Dividing and mutating at the same time?

499
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,190
And nothing to stop it.

500
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,750
Normal Earth checks and balances don't exist for it.

501
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:38,230
We'd better get a biomath mapping of its new growth potential and spread.

502
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:51,090
<i>According to this,</i> <i>there'll be a supercolony...</i>

503
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,170
of Andromeda over the entire Southwest...

504
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,300
Jeremy, these are biological warfare maps.

505
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:02,040
Why, yes, so they are.

506
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:05,550
Oh, but simulations, Charlie.

507
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,790
Defensive. It's just a scenario.

508
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,510
That's not the point, for God's sake!

509
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,070
Wildfire was built for germ warfare!

510
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,930
Wildfire and Scoop. And you knew, Stone. You knew it!

511
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,690
That's not true, Ruth. I learned about Scoop the same time you did.

512
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,350
They already have Andromeda programmed.

513
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,380
The purpose of Scoop was to find new biological weapons in outer space,

514
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,210
and then use Wildfire to develop them. It stinks!

515
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:31,830
You're blowing your tops. We have no proof.

516
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,310
The map! <i>Don't be an ass!</i>

517
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:36,190
That map only shows what Andromeda could do in the hands of an enemy.

518
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,900
Enemy? We did it to ourselves.

519
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:42,170
Perhaps, but this is hardly the time to organize a protest.

520
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:45,100
Another giant leap for mankind!

521
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,090
I wish I could believe you.

522
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,030
Whether you do or not, the only important thing now is to find the antidote.

523
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,470
Let's get on with it, Charlie.

524
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,150
Test the cultured organisms for biologic potency.

525
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,550
All right, I'll run them against a rat in autopsy.

526
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:02,160
I want to seal up the capsule. Watch it.

527
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:06,030
Andromeda's altered. Its effect might be radically different.

528
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,310
I'll try to get us a photo of the mutated form.

529
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,940
<i>Photo lab to red map.</i>

530
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,020
<i>The offbeat access reference</i> <i>reads at 649-F, 1,500...</i>

531
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,510
<i>Please copy.</i>

532
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,230
This may be the key to beating Andromeda.

533
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,890
How, by starving him to death? No, but don't feed him until I tell you.

534
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,740
Contamination!

535
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,980
<i>A seal has broken in autopsy.</i> <i>A seal has broken in autopsy.</i>

536
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,320
<i>Emergency procedures</i> <i>are in effect.</i>

537
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:10,520
What's the matter? Infection spread. Autopsy.

538
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,940
Is he alive? I should've been with him! Dr. Dutton!

539
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,830
It's no use. It's sealed off.

540
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:27,160
Dr. Hall!

541
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,540
She's in trouble.

542
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,460
Ruth, are you...

543
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,650
She's got the germ!

544
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:04,210
Someone bring 100 milligrams of phenobarb in a syringe fast!

545
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,550
There's no danger. She isn't contagious.

546
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,740
<i>There's no danger!</i>

547
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:18,420
<i>... to L-5, P.I.E. and E.T.E.</i>

548
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:21,210
<i>Your second quarter rest period</i> <i>has been canceled.</i>

549
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,830
<i>Time R.A. has been reassigned...</i>

550
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,170
<i>according to crash program "E."</i>

551
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:29,210
Come on!

552
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:30,620
Come on. She can't hurt you.

553
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,820
Wasn't she with Dr. Dutton?

554
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:36,240
No, it's epilepsy. Give her the injection. She'll be all right.

555
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,020
Good girl. Thanks.

556
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,940
I'm scared. Oh, Lord, I'm scared.

557
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,630
You'll be okay, Charlie. We're pumping pure oxygen through your lab now.

558
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,870
<i>We know Andromeda</i> <i>doesn't do well in oxygen.</i>

559
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,710
He's alive! Where have you been?

560
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,550
Leavitt had a seizure. What?

561
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,000
Epilepsy. The red light flashing at 3 per second brought on a fit.

562
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,930
Why in the hell didn't she tell us about it?

563
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,790
No top lab would have her if they knew. Insurance, prejudice, all that crap.

564
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,720
From the Middle Ages.

565
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,600
<i>Amazing he's still alive.</i>

566
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,570
Well, it's been three minutes.

567
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:18,540
<i>He's on pure oxygen.</i> <i>I don't know how long</i> <i>that can hold him.</i>

568
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:21,300
We're, uh, working on some ideas, Charlie.

569
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:24,500
Ask your germ warfare friends.

570
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,420
They have lots.

571
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,500
<i>Try to stay calm.</i>

572
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:30,430
What happened?

573
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:32,660
Seal must've broken in there.

574
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,060
They had the same thing at the lunar lab.

575
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,330
That's why we use polycron gaskets here.

576
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,740
At least the rest of Wildfire is secure.

577
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,990
Poor devil.

578
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,700
<i>Look at the way</i> <i>he's breathing.</i> <i>He's scared to death.</i>

579
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:51,600
That oxygen should relax him, slow down his breathing.

580
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,560
No, we want him to breathe fast!

581
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:56,240
In Piedmont, Jackson was crocked on Sterno. Sterno acidosis.

582
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:57,740
Acidosis: rapid breathing.

583
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,750
- What the hell you doing? - Turn off the oxygen. Put him on room air.

584
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:03,410
The baby, he's normal. Cries all the time. Can't catch his breath.

585
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,690
Rapid breathing? It just can't be that simple. It isn't.

586
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:08,790
Dutton, I think rapid breathing helps.

587
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,990
<i>Don't let the bug</i> <i>in your lungs long enough</i> <i>to penetrate blood vessels.</i>

588
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:16,370
I want to turn off the pure oxygen, then you start breathing room air as fast as you can.

589
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,610
No! No. I was running a test in here.

590
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:23,290
<i>The air is thick with Andromeda.</i> <i>Experiment with your own life, damn it!</i>

591
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:25,240
We won't do it, Charlie. Take it easy. I know I'm close.

592
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:29,080
I'm sure it has something to do with blood chemistry and breathing. <i>Dr. Hall.</i>

593
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,460
May I please feed the baby now? He's been crying steadily...

594
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,810
That's what I want. Keep him crying.

595
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:37,360
Run another blood value on him. Get his pH measurements.

596
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:40,430
Yes, Doctor!

597
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:45,010
With all the yelling, blowing off carbon dioxide, the kid should have too little acid.

598
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:49,360
Alkaline: a blood condition just the opposite from the old man. Too much alkali.

599
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,120
Well, what good does that do Dutton?

600
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:54,100
Karen, where's the blood test?

601
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:57,940
It's coming through now on your console.

602
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:00,280
Hell of a way to run a hospital.

603
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,140
<i>Just what you expected.</i>

604
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,380
<i>Opposite blood chemistries,</i> <i>the baby and the old man.</i>

605
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,300
One of them should be a dead opposite But he's not.

606
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,470
There must be a connection!

607
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,500
They both stayed alive at Piedmont breathing the same air.

608
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:19,950
One's blood too alkaline, the other too... acid.

609
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,030
Yes. Yes!

610
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:32,090
Dutton, I'm turning off the oxygen. Breathe fast and hard.

611
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:34,460
No, Jeremy! Don't let him cut off my oxygen.

612
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,170
No! The air in that room is loaded... Air doesn't matter.

613
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,050
Blood does. That's the answer.

614
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:51,130
I need 30 seconds to run a growth program.

615
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:53,050
He could die in 30 seconds.

616
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:55,060
<i>Besides, Leavitt checked</i> <i>all the growth programs.</i>

617
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:57,100
<i>She might have missed something.</i> <i>Epileptics blank out.</i>

618
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:01,040
I want to see how the growth of Andromeda is affected by blood chemistry. The pH...

619
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,500
Oh, damn!

620
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,350
<i>You do it.</i>

621
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:26,070
<i>Excellent.</i> <i>The graph's practically</i> <i>straight up and down.</i>

622
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:29,100
<i>That means Andromeda</i> <i>can only exist within</i> <i>a narrow range of pH.</i>

623
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:31,060
<i>A very narrow range.</i>

624
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:33,200
On either side of the tolerance range, no growth.

625
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:35,440
Nothing, right? It's exterminated.

626
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:40,280
Dutton, our troubles are over. <i>Look at your console.</i>

627
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,690
<i>It grows within</i> <i>a narrow range of pH.</i> <i>A very narrow range.</i>

628
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:47,120
If your blood's abnormal, if it's too acid or alkaline,

629
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,780
Andromeda can't survive in the body.

630
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:53,360
So breathe as fast as you can. Go into respiratory alkalosis.

631
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:01,490
Yes, fine. That'll shoot your blood chemistry to hell.

632
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,040
It's what happens to the baby when he cries too much, or the old man on Sterno.

633
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:08,810
<i>How do you feel?</i> Okay.

634
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:11,130
A little dizzy, but okay.

635
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:13,230
He can't keep breathing like that forever.

636
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:16,210
He'll hyperventilate, pass out. We've got to get him something to alkalize his blood.

637
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,800
We can't in there.

638
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,730
Charlie!

639
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:24,690
<i>That cage...</i> <i>in the hot room.</i>

640
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,800
<i>Right in front of you.</i>

641
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,690
<i>It's alive!</i>

642
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,140
The rat's been exposed as long as I have.

643
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,280
Longer. I exposed it to the cultures before the seal broke.

644
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:39,350
Precisely. Andromeda's mutated to a noninfectious form.

645
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,170
Holy!

646
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:51,990
Where does that gasket lead? Central core.

647
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,910
It connects all the labs.

648
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:01,040
The gaskets are decomposing. It's Andromeda.

649
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:10,000
Next sector. There's no substation in this sector.

650
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:25,270
<i>Level 5 is sealed.</i> <i>Level 5 is sealed.</i>

651
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,280
<i>Emergency procedures</i> <i>are in effect.</i>

652
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:30,260
When the bomb goes off, there'll be a thousand mutations.

653
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:32,720
Andromeda will spread everywhere. They'll never be rid of it.

654
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:36,750
<i>There are now five minutes</i> <i>to self-destruct.</i>

655
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:40,090
<i>What about the other levels?</i>

656
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:43,900
Can't tell. Each sector seals off when it's contaminated, even the elevator.

657
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,370
<i>The defense system</i> <i>is perfect.</i>

658
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,030
It'll even bury our mistakes.

659
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,290
What about the central core?

660
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,350
The core's equipped with safeguards. Like what?

661
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,000
<i>Gas, lasers, to prevent</i> <i>escape of lab animals.</i>

662
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:05,720
- What would my chances be? - They don't exist for anyone anywhere if you stay here.

663
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,690
How do I get into the core? Through that service port.

664
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,620
<i>Go ahead.</i> <i>I'll ride shotgun for you</i> <i>in main control.</i>

665
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,640
I can't monitor the lasers here.

666
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,570
Karen, get me a scalpel.

667
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:21,420
<i>There are now four minutes</i> <i>and 30 seconds to self-destruct.</i>

668
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:28,210
Cut it off! Cut the panel off.

669
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:33,010
Karen, cut it!

670
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,690
Come on. Hurry up.

671
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:50,350
Hey, Doc, you ain't leavin' us here, are ya?

672
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:54,840
The lasers are tuned low for small animals, Mark.

673
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:57,770
<i>You can make it if you're</i> <i>not hit along the spinal cord.</i>

674
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:02,100
<i>There are now four minutes</i> <i>to self-destruct.</i>

675
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:18,260
<i>That's the ladder</i> <i>across from you.</i> <i>Go before the gas starts.</i>

676
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:30,550
<i>There are now three minutes</i> <i>and 30 seconds...</i>

677
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,460
<i>to self-destruct.</i> <i>That's the gas. Keep going.</i>

678
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,440
The sensors have picked you up. Get moving.

679
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:44,530
<i>Duck!</i>

680
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,320
<i>Keep going.</i>

681
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:49,170
<i>Duck!</i>

682
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,310
<i>Keep going.</i>

683
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,080
<i>Duck!</i>

684
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:58,520
<i>There are now three minutes</i> <i>to self-destruct.</i>

685
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,930
<i>No, it's no good.</i>

686
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,980
The level's contaminated. You'll have to go to 3.

687
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:07,090
<i>Go to 3!</i>

688
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:12,380
<i>There are now two minutes</i> <i>and 45 seconds to self-destruct.</i>

689
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,220
<i>Sway! Weave!</i>

690
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:20,500
<i>You're zeroed in.</i> <i>Duck!</i>

691
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:23,890
<i>There are now two minutes</i> <i>and 30 seconds...</i>

692

<i>to self-destruct.</i>

693
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,660
<i>Keep going!</i> <i>You'll make it.</i>

694
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:40,220
<i>There are now two minutes</i> <i>and 15 seconds to self-destruct.</i>

695
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,170
<i>Fight the effect.</i> <i>It's mostly shock.</i>

696
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,310
You've lost some time, but you can still do it. See the door?

697
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:56,500
<i>There are now two minutes</i> <i>to self-destruct.</i>

698
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:09,780

00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,060
<i>There is now...</i> <i>You're in an airlock.</i>

703
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:34,030
Turn the wheel. <i>one minute and 15 seconds</i> <i>to self-destruct.</i>

704
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,520
No, not that one. The one near the door.

705
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:46,830
<i>There are now 60 seconds</i> <i>to self-destruct.</i>

<i>There are now 50 seconds</i> <i>to self-destruct.</i>

708
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:05,650
Where is it? <i>There are now...</i>

709
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,210
<i>45 seconds</i> <i>to self-destruct.</i> Come on. Where is it?

710
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,260
Help me!

711
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:15,250
<i>There are now 40 seconds</i> <i>to self-destruct.</i>

<i>There are now 25 seconds</i> <i>to self-destruct.</i>

715
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:41,810
<i>Twenty seconds,</i> <i>19, 18, 17,</i>

716
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,860
<i>16, 15,</i>

<i>11, 10, 9...</i>

<i>Self-destruct</i> <i>has been canceled.</i>

720
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,030
<i>Congratulations.</i>

721
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,670
I take it the bomb didn't...

722
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:08,850
No, it didn't.

723
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,890
Eight seconds to spare. Hardly even exciting.

724
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:14,840
What's happening?

725
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,770
The supercolony's now off the coast...

726
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:19,890
and moving southwest across the Pacific.

727
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,870
Apparently Andromeda hasn't turned lethal again.

728
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:24,630
At least there haven't been any reports of bizarre deaths.

729
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,060
<i>We're applying an adaptation</i> <i>of your antidote to it.</i>

730
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,910
Cloud seeding. We're seeding the clouds above Andromeda...

731
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,830
with silver iodide.

732
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,200
<i>The raindrops will carry</i> <i>the organism into the ocean,</i>

733
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,880
<i>and the alkaline reaction</i> <i>from seawater should kill it.</i>

734
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:40,250
<i>Just as acids or alkali</i> <i>in the blood stopped it.</i>

735
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,620
<i>This cloud seeding business,</i> <i>you absolutely sure it worked?</i>

736
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:49,710
<i>You better be.</i> <i>All reports indicate</i> <i>the experiment was successful.</i>

737
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:54,190
<i>Then we can</i> <i>feel confident your so-called</i> <i>biological crisis is over?</i>

738
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,830
<i>As far as Andromeda's concerned,</i> <i>yes.</i>

739
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,580
<i>We have the organism at Wildfire</i> <i>and we continue to study it.</i>

740
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:02,710
<i>We now know beyond a doubt</i> <i>that other forms of life exist</i> <i>in the universe.</i>

741
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:06,360
<i>- Thanks to Scoop.</i> - Yes.

742
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:09,460
However, with this new knowledge, there's no guarantee...

743
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:13,300
that another so-called biological crisis won't occur again.

744
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:15,310
Hmm.

745
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,750
What do we do about that?

746
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:20,090
Precisely, Senator.

747
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:22,420
What do we do?
