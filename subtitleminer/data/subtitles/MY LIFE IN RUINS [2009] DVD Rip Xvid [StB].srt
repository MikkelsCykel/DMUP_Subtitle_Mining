MY LIFE IN RUINS [2009] DVD Rip Xvid [StB]

2
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:26,414
Greece.

3
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:30,975
People come here from all over

4
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,456
to see the ancient ruins.

5
00:00:37,976 --> 00:00:39,856
To bask in history.

6
00:00:41,977 --> 00:00:45,657
To be a part of the birthplace
of civilization.

7
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:50,578
People reconnect with their souls.

8
00:00:51,578 --> 00:00:53,539
They find their mojo.

9
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,580
In Greece, it's called kefi,

10
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:05,301
which means "passion, joy, spirit."

11
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:09,781
Late!

12
00:01:10,982 --> 00:01:12,502
Goodbye, Genaki.

13
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:16,543
In a week.
That window's stuck again.

14
00:01:16,663 --> 00:01:19,703
- Bravo. Where is the rent?
- I left it on the trapesi.

15
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:31,025
Now, me, I love the beauty
and architecture of ancient Greece.

16
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,906
But living in modern Greece
can be a bit frustrating.

17
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:38,026
Sometimes things go fast.

18
00:01:39,986 --> 00:01:41,427
Most times,

19
00:01:44,107 --> 00:01:45,587
not so much.

20
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:49,148
I came here a year ago to teach
at Athens University.

21
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:53,629
Cutbacks left me without a job.
So now, for now,

22
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:56,229
I work at Pangloss Tours.

23
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:57,509
Georgia!

24
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,070
Oh, yeah. I've hit rock bottom.

25
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:09,271
Georgia. Again you cut out beach day.

26
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:11,872
They can go to the beach in any country.

27
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:14,872
On my tour,
I teach them about ancient architecture.

28
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:17,193
Nobody comes to Greece to learn.

29
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:19,513
Maria, I disagree.

30
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:27,434
- It's open.
- You didn't get the job.

31
00:02:32,515 --> 00:02:34,356
Don't you read the evaluations?

32
00:02:34,476 --> 00:02:37,516
"What do you think of Georgia
as tour director?"

33
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:41,077
"Average. Average. Average."

34
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:42,637
So I'm average.

35
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:44,637
Average is the lowest box you can check.

36
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:46,638
Do you think we have
something that says, "Stinks"?

37
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:48,998
And if we did, you'd be stinks.

38
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:52,359
- "I find your tour boring."
- My tourists are boring.

39
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,319
I think I've guided, like, 34 tours

40
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,319
and you give me the same tourists
over and over again.

41
00:02:57,399 --> 00:03:00,880
Look! There they are.
The Tipsy Australians.

42
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,281
- The Obnoxious Americans.
- It's called "rip-off."

43
00:03:06,481 --> 00:03:08,401
The Miserable Marriages.

44
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:12,482
The Disgusted-With-Men-
But-Still-Looking Divorcees.

45
00:03:13,522 --> 00:03:16,323
- Stop!
- And, of course, The Old People.

46
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:18,883
- I don't see Mr. Funny.
- Who?

47
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:23,444
There's always one annoying guy
who thinks he's the life of the party.

48
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:28,165
Canadians. Polite Canadians.

49
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:29,485
- Can I have them?
- No.

50
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:31,565
They're in Group A. Nico's group.

51
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:34,126
Why does Nico
always get the good group?

52
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:36,646
His evaluations don't say, "Average."

53
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,246
God!

54
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:43,607
By the way,
Spiros eloped with that girl with no foot.

55
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:45,928
- Excellent.
- Why?

56
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:49,408
- I'm being sarcastic.
- You're not funny. Stop trying.

57
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:53,369
- Who's my driver? Not Themio.
- Relax. He's in jail.

58
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:55,889
You got the substitute. Procopi.

59
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:58,370
The creepy, hairy, creepy guy?

60
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,290
He's right behind me, isn't he?

61
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:07,891
- Does he speak English?
- I don't know if he speaks anything.

62
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:10,612
Maybe they caught a bear.
Taught it to drive.

63
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:14,812
So I have rules. You cannot speed,

64
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:17,973
you cannot smoke
and you cannot eat while driving.

65
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:24,694
Great, he doesn't speak English.

66
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,934
Don't forget to brush him.

67
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:31,215
- Maria! Maria!
- Nico! Nico!

68
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:36,536
Hey, thank you for my group, eh? Whoa!

69
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:39,296
He bribes you for the good group?

70
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,577
- No.
- Yes.

71
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:42,217
Oh.

72
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:53,379
That girl. That girl has no kefi.

73
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:56,259
What Greek does not have spirit, eh?

74
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:59,060
Maybe she's half Greek.

75
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,660
This was supposed to be temporary while
she looked for some big-shot teaching job.

76
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,101
And now no one will hire her
and I am stuck with her.

77
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:10,782
Hey, if I make her quit, can I have a raise?

78
00:05:11,182 --> 00:05:13,662
I don't want to know about it. Yes.

79
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:23,744
- Group B! Group B, everyone.
- Hey!

80
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,624
Group B, hello, I'm Georgia.
Welcome to Greece. I'm your tour guide.

81
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,785
I'm Irv Giddeon,

82
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:32,745
and I've come here to see
as many ancient ruins as possible.

83
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:36,226
And judging from your husband,
the trip is already a success.

84
00:05:40,027 --> 00:05:42,307
There you are! And, indeed, funny.

85
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:45,347
I'm killing me.

86
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:47,828
How many of you, like me, have come here

87
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,788
to fondle as many nude statues
as possible?

88
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:53,469
- Half the reason I came.
- Get your hand down.

89
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:57,709
Jeez. This is comedy.
The Greeks invented it.

90
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,550
It's like mustaches on women.

91
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,831
You know, we left Adelaide last night
with 17 pounds of frozen flake.

92
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:08,711
Thirty hours later, she's right on the bugle.

93
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,032
I'm giving it liquid yawns in the dunnies.

94
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:12,592
- It was a shocker, Barry.
- Yeah.

95
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:15,672
- Are they speaking words?
- Australians are the nicest people,

96
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,953
but you can only understand
about half of what they say.

97
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:20,713
...a bad case of the trots
of last night's tucker.

98
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,954
It's the last time I ate fish.

99
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:27,995
Excuse me. Is this Pangloss Tours?

100
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:30,035
Group B?

101
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:34,036
Sweet marble cake, she speaks American.
Come on, get it up now.

102
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:35,996
Okay. Ha-ha!

103
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,956
- Okay, everybody, let's get on the bus.
- Oh, yes.

104
00:06:39,036 --> 00:06:41,557
Okay, Group B, got your tickets?
Follow me.

105
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:52,079
Spooky.

106
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,080
Okay. Now make sure that your luggage
is tagged and the driver will stow it.

107
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,680
- Okay, you got me.
- Sorry.

108
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,721
- That's okay. Dr. Tullen?
- Oh, no, no. I'm Mr., that's...

109
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,121
I am Dr. Tullen.
And this is our daughter, Caitlin.

110
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:09,842
- Do smile, darling.
- I am.

111
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:13,082
Hey, big fellow, how many bells
have you got on the old dickory?

112
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:15,122
What the hell? What the hell is he saying?

113
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:18,443
Oh, wake up, Australia.
He wants to know what time it is.

114
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:19,763
- See, if it's...
- Here you go.

115
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:22,964
...10 hours ahead here,
then that would make it...

116
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:25,324
Kimmy, what time is it back in the States?

117
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,005
- The right time.
- Good one, Kimmy.

118
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:31,085
Kim and Al Sawchuck. S-A-W-Chuck.

119
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:32,765
- Come on, Al. Come on, Big Al.
- AI Sawchuck. How are you?

120
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:33,926
- Okay. How are you?
- Let's go, Big Al.

121
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:37,446
Okay, there you go. There you go.

122
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,247
There's no smoking on the bus.

123
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:48,248
- I have a question.
- Yeah.

124
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,688
What's with the beekeeper?

125
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:53,649
My wife needs protection from the sun.

126
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:55,809
But we're not going to the sun.

127
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:00,210
That man is so rude. Make it stop.

128
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:08,571
Excuse me, ladies. Hey, there.

129
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:10,812
I'm Marc Mallard. IHOP.

130
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:13,692
That's the International House
of Pancakes.

131
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:16,173
Did one of you lose this?

132
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:19,813
Thank you, Marc. I must have dropped it.

133
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:23,534
It looks like a raspberry waffle.

134
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:27,014
- Or a tart.
- Or a tart.

135
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:32,295
Hi. I'm Lena María Angustias
Teresa Fernández de la Vega Rodríguez.

136
00:08:32,415 --> 00:08:33,736
And she's Lala Cruz.

137
00:08:33,816 --> 00:08:35,616
- We're from España.
- Really?

138
00:08:35,696 --> 00:08:36,776
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

139
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:40,297
- And we are both recently divorced.
- And off men.

140
00:08:41,097 --> 00:08:42,057
Hmm.

141
00:08:43,137 --> 00:08:45,257
Hi. I'm Marc Mallard. IHOP.

142
00:08:45,377 --> 00:08:48,258
Hello. Georgia Yanokoupolis.
Pangloss Tours.

143
00:08:49,338 --> 00:08:51,579
- I'll see you on the bus.
- Okay.

144
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:55,619
Group B? Yes. Names.

145
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,820
You don't speak English, do you?

146
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,380
And Maria gave you to me.

147
00:09:04,581 --> 00:09:07,221
Luggage this way.
And then you get on the bus.

148
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:10,022
- Excuse me. I'm looking for the bus.
- Yeah.

149
00:09:11,022 --> 00:09:13,142
- This is it.
- Group B?

150
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:16,263
- Oh, cool.
- Okay.

151
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,703
Hey, Gator Phillips.

152
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:23,304
- I'm from Florida, the States.
- You're traveling alone?

153
00:09:23,744 --> 00:09:27,144
No way, man.
I'm gonna meet my girlfriend in Greece.

154
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:29,585
- We are in Greece.
- Now?

155
00:09:31,665 --> 00:09:34,546
Right on. Thanks, man.

156
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:37,266
- Okay, here you go.
- Is this free?

157
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:38,426
- Yeah.
- Whoa!

158
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:46,068
Kalimera, everyone.
That's Greek for, "Good morning."

159
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:49,588
Hello, beautiful people. I am Nico.

160
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,469
For you, warm loucoumades.

161
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:55,789
Oh, I'm so sorry. Wrong bus.

162
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,670
- Hey, wait a minute...
- What the hell? Where's our donuts?

163
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,710
What a rip!

164
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,551
I'm gonna get... I could get you some later,
maybe. I'll look around.

165
00:10:04,631 --> 00:10:05,591
- Yeah...
- We should get something.

166
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:07,631
Let's go.

167
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:10,672
I mean, who needs the carbs, right?

168
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:13,392
Not me. My ankles swell from the wheat.

169
00:10:15,312 --> 00:10:18,873
Okay, you might want to write this down.

170
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:24,034
In 1834, Athens became
the capital of modern Greece.

171
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:28,435
Now, I'm not just a tour guide.
I am a professor of classical history.

172
00:10:28,555 --> 00:10:30,075
Oh, great!
Are we gonna have a test now?

173
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:32,875
So I'm going to teach you
all about the architecture

174
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:34,876
and monuments of ancient Greece.

175
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:37,796
- Like the propylea.
- Which is the word for donuts.

176
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:44,117
- My name is Georgia.
- Louder, please.

177
00:10:44,237 --> 00:10:46,438
- My name is Georgia.
- Yes, dear.

178
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:48,998
I'm Dorcas, Dorcas Wilmore.

179
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:51,839
And this is my husband, Barnaby.

180
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,479
Oh, I've got everyone a little souvenir.

181
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:58,360
- To remember our trip together.
- All right.

182
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,480
- Oh, you shouldn't have.
- This must have cost you a shload.

183
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,441
Oh, no, it was nothing.

184
00:11:03,681 --> 00:11:06,361
Hand those around, would you, dear?

185
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:10,402
Guide, this bus is really stuffy.

186
00:11:10,522 --> 00:11:13,922
- My daughter, Caitlin, needs fresh air.
- Okay, no problem.

187
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:19,963
Uh-oh.

188
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,044
- Turn it off!
- Oh, my God!

189
00:11:30,085 --> 00:11:31,725
Smells like death.

190
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,046
Sorry about that.

191
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,966
- Angie?
- It's Georgia.

192
00:11:38,086 --> 00:11:41,247
Is the Sasquatch gonna be
with us the whole time?

193
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:44,247
- He's the driver.
- What's his name?

194
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:47,568
Right. Everyone,
please say hello to Procopi.

195
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:49,928
- Hey, Procopi.
- Hello, Procopi.

196
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,489
Oh, I'm sorry. He has a nickname
he'd rather be known by.

197
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:56,689
Poupi.

198
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,810
Did he just say, "Poop"?

199
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,490
Fair suck of the sav,
mate, I can't call you Poupi.

200
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,570
What's your last name?

201
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:12,252
It's Kakas.

202
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:23,694
They're laughing at your name.

203
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:25,774
So what? Laughing is good.

204
00:12:45,137 --> 00:12:47,658
- Okay! Yeah.
- It's hot.

205
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:51,419
Come, come, come.
I love you beautiful people.

206
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:53,939
All right, everybody,
let's go this way. Come on.

207
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:57,820
Well, I have an exciting day planned.
But, first, listen.

208
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,260
Whenever we stop the bus, whether it be
for restrooms or lunch or for touring,

209
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,581
the driver or I will lock the bus. So you
can leave whatever you need in there.

210
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,301
Cameras, sweaters, handbags, anything.

211
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,702
- What about sweaters?
- Anything.

212
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:12,262
- Handbags?
- Yes.

213
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:13,782
Cameras, too?

214
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:17,503
Cameras, too.
Anything, anytime, anywhere.

215
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,744
- Anything.
- Come on, Barnaby. Come on.

216
00:13:21,824 --> 00:13:25,784
We are now walking through
the tholos. Say it with me? Anyone?

217
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:28,705
Okay. The Greek word "agora"
means a place of gathering,

218
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:31,545
and in ancient times,
this was the heart of Athenian life.

219
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:33,826
Plato and Socrates taught philosophy here.

220
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,466
- She still talking?
- It's hot.

221
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:36,626
- Yes.
- Where can we get ice cream?

222
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:38,426
- Is there, like, a mini-mart around here?
- lf you just...

223
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:40,707
I thought this was
the ancient supermarket.

224
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:42,347
- lf you go back to...
- Come, come.

225
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:45,108
I have a surprise for you. Look. Hey!

226
00:13:45,388 --> 00:13:48,228
Come, beautiful people. Who wants to be
Zeus and Athena? Please, please, come.

227
00:13:48,348 --> 00:13:49,708
- Photo op here.
- Look, he's great.

228
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,149
- Come on.
- Hey, can we do that?

229
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:53,509
- I wish I was over there.
- That's cheesy.

230
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:55,069
- That's the good group.
- I want to take a listen.

231
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:57,950
There's a god with a camera. He's a very
clever god. He invented the camera.

232
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,070
All right, we're going to
the Temple of Hephaestus now. This way.

233
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,871
It's an exciting chapter in history.
Come on, everyone.

234
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:08,471
I'd rather get my picture taken
as Zeus over there.

235
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:11,152
It's this way. Come on.
I know it's hot.

236
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:16,153
The Temple of Hephaestus,

237
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:18,353
- built between 460 and 415...
- In the words of Big Kev, love...

238
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:20,433
- We're excited!
- We're excited!

239
00:14:20,513 --> 00:14:22,594
- I'm not sure if they allow beer here.
- Okay, I'll finish it off.

240
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:24,874
- Okay. There's a trash can over there.
- At last some excitement.

241
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:27,195
Built between 460 and 415 B. C...

242
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:30,115
This place looks just like
our Washington, D.C. IHOP.

243
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:32,835
- No, actually, I'm sure it doesn't.
- Hey, Ange, hey, Ange! Ange!

244
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:35,876
Al and his crew could have
this place fixed up in a couple of minutes.

245
00:14:35,996 --> 00:14:38,516
Dry wall, new roof, walk-in closets.

246
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,477
- Flip that house!
- Flip that house!

247
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:45,598
That's a joke. I'm sure that's a joke,

248
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:48,158
because making it new
would not make it more beautiful.

249
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:50,798
The point is, it's ancient.

250
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:54,239
It's ancient. I mean, look at it.

251
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,480
Isn't it magnificent?

252
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,440
Come this way, beautiful people.
Nico puts the gloss into Pangloss. Yes?

253
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,801
Now come around. Please, come around.
Thank you.

254
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:08,161
So come around, please.
That's the temple there.

255
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,082
- It's very nice, yes?
- Yes.

256
00:15:10,162 --> 00:15:13,122
Enough culture. Now, souvenirs, yes?

257
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:15,843
Who wants that temple made of soap?

258
00:15:16,923 --> 00:15:19,403
- Temple on a rope, yeah?
- Me, please.

259
00:15:19,923 --> 00:15:21,564
No, no, that's not authentic.

260
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:22,924
- You don't want that.
- We like those.

261
00:15:23,044 --> 00:15:25,884
Hey, Group B.
You want to come shopping with Nico?

262
00:15:26,004 --> 00:15:27,605
Nico, what are you doing?

263
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:29,125
No, Group B, you're with me.

264
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:32,005
I've an hour of shopping
scheduled on Day 4.

265
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:35,246
- This way, hon.
- We got everything, my friend.

266
00:15:35,366 --> 00:15:39,087
Come this way, follow the pretty ladies.
Hey, beautiful ladies!

267
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:41,567
Meet back at the bus in 40 minutes.

268
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:47,488
Standing in the middle
of culture and history,

269
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:52,689
and they want a 50-50 poly-cotton blend
T-shirt with a picture of a Trojan horse.

270
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,571
Why am I spending my life
showing tourists

271
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:07,211
gorgeous ancient ruins
they care nothing about?

272
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:11,492
And Pangloss Tours pays lousy.
They book the worst hotel rooms.

273
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:14,853
I don't have any friends here.
I actually don't know anybody.

274
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,413
Really, I haven't had sex in forever.

275
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:20,813
- Forever is a long time.
- Yeah.

276
00:16:25,814 --> 00:16:27,855
- You speak English.
- Yes.

277
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:29,415
I do, too.

278
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:32,055
42 euros.

279
00:16:32,896 --> 00:16:35,296
That's great. Anybody else?

280
00:16:36,776 --> 00:16:41,457
Excellent. Excuse me. Nice to meet you.
Excuse me. Bye.

281
00:16:43,097 --> 00:16:45,618
- You must think I'm crazy.
- Yes.

282
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:49,578
Fair enough. Why would you not tell me?

283
00:16:49,938 --> 00:16:53,939
I thought you needed to talk.
I have three sisters. So talk.

284
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:58,300
Do you ever question
what you're doing with your life?

285
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,220
- No.
- What?

286
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,461
- Talk more about the no sex.
- I'm good, thanks.

287
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:06,901
You don't question? Come on,
Greece is the land of philosophers.

288
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:10,302
Yes. But that is their job.
My job is to drive the bus.

289
00:17:10,422 --> 00:17:12,102
You know, it pays better.

290
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:14,302
Come on. You don't have a life plan?

291
00:17:14,422 --> 00:17:16,463
- How do you plan life?
- What?

292
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:20,984
Come on.
We'll get some coffee and you can talk.

293
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:22,664
What? We're working.

294
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:24,664
Everyone should take the time for a coffee.

295
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:27,865
That is the typical Greek mentality.

296
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:30,745
Woman. Where's your kefi?

297
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:33,066
- I have kefi. I have lots of kefi.
- No.

298
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,146
- No, you don't. No.
- Yes, I do.

299
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:37,866
That's why you're so uptight and skinny.

300
00:17:39,107 --> 00:17:40,227
Skinny?

301
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:45,308
Look, we're late, so no coffee. Hey.

302
00:17:45,468 --> 00:17:48,308
Everybody in Nico's group
has nice vacation.

303
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:49,828
You want to have relation with me?

304
00:17:50,628 --> 00:17:52,589
What's that postcard there?

305
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:57,070
Which one? Which side
do you want? The one up above or this one?

306
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,910
Oh, that's nice. Good.

307
00:18:02,991 --> 00:18:04,231
Group B!

308
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:06,911
Group B!

309
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:09,312
Gather up, Group B.

310
00:18:09,432 --> 00:18:12,552
Well, we're a little behind schedule.
A lot. So...

311
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:14,833
I picked up something
that we can eat on the bus.

312
00:18:14,953 --> 00:18:17,113
And it is a special treat.

313
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:19,193
- What is that?
- It's souvlaki.

314
00:18:19,273 --> 00:18:22,274
- It's meat on a stick.
- What kind of meat is that?

315
00:18:22,514 --> 00:18:23,874
It looks like poodle.

316
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:26,915
- That's not right.
- It's not poodle.

317
00:18:26,995 --> 00:18:30,595
Hey. Hey, come to the Hard Rock Cafe.
It's very Greek.

318
00:18:30,715 --> 00:18:32,475
- Dude, Hard Rock!
- Come! Come on.

319
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:34,596
Chicken fingers and French fries!

320
00:18:36,196 --> 00:18:37,316
No, no.

321
00:18:38,757 --> 00:18:40,997
I have souvlaki.
Why would you want to... That...

322
00:18:40,997 --> 00:18:41,437
I have souvlaki.
Why would you want to... That...

323
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:43,597
Yeah. Get a Greek salad.

324
00:18:44,477 --> 00:18:47,198
Hard Rock.
Doesn't sound very Greek to me.

325
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:54,239
- Hi, it's Caitlin, right? Having fun?
- No.

326
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,080
- Well, what are you listening to?
- Nothing.

327
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,120
- When are we going to the beach?
- That's not on my itinerary.

328
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,321
Of course not. This sucks.

329
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:07,401
Sorry about that.

330
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:11,522
My daughter's chronically unhappy.
It's not her fault. It's a genetic thing.

331
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:13,242
Hansdorf syndrome.

332
00:19:14,162 --> 00:19:16,163
Mr. Tullen, I'm so sorry.

333
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:28,205
Okay, let's learn some
more Greek.

334
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:32,085
Kalispera, kalispera, everyone.
That's Greek for, "Good evening."

335
00:19:33,526 --> 00:19:34,926
Can you say it with me?

336
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:40,807
Wow. Are you sure you're not Greek?

337
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:10,572
Hey, Georgia.

338
00:20:17,493 --> 00:20:21,054
I'm sorry. I got sunblock in my eye.
Do you have any drops?

339
00:20:21,374 --> 00:20:22,414
I do.

340
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:44,377
This way, please. Beautiful people.
Ladies and gentlemen, this way, please.

341
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:46,138
What is this place?

342
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,738
Hey, hey, hey, Georgia, Georgia.

343
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:51,939
- You're staying there?
- Aren't you?

344
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:55,739
No way! Great hotel. Best chain in Greece.

345
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,900
This way, please, Canadians.

346
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,900
Everybody got your luggage?

347
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,821
Wow. What a dump.

348
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:09,342
Only about three at a time are
gonna fit in this elevator.

349
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:12,982
Oh, Al, honey. We gotta get to the room.
I'm ovulating. Like, now.

350
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:16,863
Kimmy, you know I can't perform
on command like that. That's not natural.

351
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,583
Get into them. It's duck's guts.

352
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:22,264
Crack open a tinny, love. After all
that yakking, you must be bloody thirsty.

353
00:21:22,904 --> 00:21:24,104
Actually, I'm a lightweight.

354
00:21:24,224 --> 00:21:27,625
One drink and I'm looking
for a bellman to make out with.

355
00:21:28,865 --> 00:21:31,385
- That was a joke.
- You're not funny.

356
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:33,186
I've heard.

357
00:21:36,746 --> 00:21:39,427
Just a converter?
Yeah, that's no problem at all.

358
00:21:39,547 --> 00:21:41,667
Okay, I can get you water,
and do you need anything?

359
00:21:43,827 --> 00:21:44,908
Here we go. Okay.

360
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:47,348
Come on, Barnaby. That's right. In you go.

361
00:21:47,468 --> 00:21:48,868
There you go.

362
00:22:19,393 --> 00:22:21,834
Your elevator is broken.

363
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:24,474
Anthony Quinn.

364
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:36,076
We have to take the stairs.

365
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:40,637
- Why?
- Because it's Greece.

366
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:46,398
In the movie Zorba the Greek, the scene
where Alan Bates and Anthony Quinn

367
00:22:46,518 --> 00:22:49,718
have just lost all their life savings.
What do they do? They dance.

368
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,639
That's the way this whole country works.
Or doesn't.

369
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:55,919
If the shower doesn't work...

370
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,200
I'm sorry.

371
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,080
...they dance.

372
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,481
Or you want a little privacy,

373
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:06,801
they dance.

374
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:11,082
I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry.
Not that sorry.

375
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:13,962
Or, God forbid, the toilet breaks...

376
00:23:16,203 --> 00:23:18,123
Oh, flapjacks.

377
00:23:18,243 --> 00:23:19,923
...you get the Greek philosophy.

378
00:23:20,003 --> 00:23:22,044
"Relax, pee outside.

379
00:23:22,164 --> 00:23:24,964
"Maybe it is your destiny
to write a poem about the sky."

380
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,525
And then they dance.

381
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:33,526
You know, Greece was
a happening place 2,500 years ago.

382
00:23:33,886 --> 00:23:36,726
It was the birthplace of art
and democracy and philosophy.

383
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:39,087
And then they discovered the nap.

384
00:23:45,728 --> 00:23:49,328
This country's disregard for rules
and order is just sloppy.

385
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:55,489
What is with this hair? Is it a full moon?

386
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:03,931
You know, you've all just got to get
your act together and stop dancing.

387
00:24:07,011 --> 00:24:09,412
Where's my fleabag of a room?

388
00:24:15,973 --> 00:24:17,253
It's fixed.

389
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:25,974
Yeah.

390
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,461
Now what?

391
00:25:10,462 --> 00:25:12,782
- Maria!
- Georgia, darling.

392
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:14,463
I'm up to my ears in work here.

393
00:25:14,543 --> 00:25:17,863
Greece has
the most beautiful accommodation.

394
00:25:19,223 --> 00:25:21,104
Like, first-class hotels with, like,

395
00:25:21,224 --> 00:25:22,984
your own swimming pool in your room.

396
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:25,184
How do you find these crappy joints?

397
00:25:25,264 --> 00:25:26,825
Lucky I find somewhere.

398
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:29,065
Yeah, you try finding a hotel
on the budget.

399
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:30,305
Maria...

400
00:25:36,306 --> 00:25:37,866
Dear Maria,

401
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:43,347
you are my only friend in Greece.
And you bite the big one.

402
00:25:44,548 --> 00:25:46,028
After this tour,

403
00:25:49,868 --> 00:25:50,989
I quit.

404
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:55,189
Love, Georgia.

405
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,551
Breakfast is on negative one,
down one floor.

406
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:04,071
Oh, cool.

407
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:11,592
Would you please mail this for me?
Certified.

408
00:26:12,632 --> 00:26:17,073
- I am on my coffee break.
- Of course. Look, I have to go.

409
00:26:34,116 --> 00:26:37,076
- 11 euros.
- What? That's like $20.

410
00:26:37,836 --> 00:26:42,357
You know, there are other ways to pay.

411
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:56,600
Does that ever work?

412
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,040
How many women have
actually slept with you for postage?

413
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:05,121
Four.

414
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:06,921
Oh.

415
00:27:07,841 --> 00:27:09,242
I'll just pay.

416
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:41,887
So we have here a beautiful church.
It's very Greek.

417
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:45,888
But you have ice creams, so we skip. Yes?

418
00:27:46,008 --> 00:27:47,488
- Yeah.
- Okay, souvenirs, yes?

419
00:27:47,608 --> 00:27:49,328
- Yeah!
- You like the vacation so far?

420
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:51,969
rocks cut in the Byzantine era.

421
00:27:53,249 --> 00:27:56,210
There are references to this church
in a very old document

422
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,610
called the Praktikon of Athens.

423
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:01,010
Take a glance and look around
at some of the murals.

424
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,491
The oldest parts of St. Marina's date back
to the 11th to 12th century B.C.

425
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:13,572
Anybody else want a pamphlet?
Anybody? Want a pamphlet?

426
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:16,173
Yes. Of course not.

427
00:28:16,253 --> 00:28:18,533
Kimmy, do you see what I see?

428
00:28:22,214 --> 00:28:25,574
That would be a great place for snacks
in the rec room.

429
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:30,815
- Do you think it's for sale?
- Everything's got its price.

430
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,376
Let's go find that preacher.

431
00:28:34,376 --> 00:28:36,136
I think they call him a rabbi here.

432
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,577
We have to have photographs
so people will believe we were here.

433
00:28:38,697 --> 00:28:40,417
Who won't believe we were here?

434
00:28:40,497 --> 00:28:42,697
Well, Donald and Peggy for a start. What?

435
00:28:42,817 --> 00:28:44,978
Why don't you all get in there?

436
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,578
Oh, that's very good of you.
Thank you very much.

437
00:28:46,698 --> 00:28:47,618
You're welcome.

438
00:28:47,738 --> 00:28:48,938
MR. TULLEN: He's going to take
our photograph.

439
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,659
Okay, here we go.

440
00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:55,459
One, two, three.

441
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,860
Four, five, six...

442
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,220
Sorry, how high are you going?

443
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,301
I'm going to keep counting
until the kid cracks a smile.

444
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:06,621
Forgot where I left off. Gotta start again.

445
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:08,302
One, two...

446
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:10,662
Just take the picture, you idiot.

447
00:29:14,783 --> 00:29:16,463
There you go, kiddo.

448
00:29:19,063 --> 00:29:20,464
Oh, my God!

449
00:29:21,224 --> 00:29:22,424
DR. TULLEN: Georgia!

450
00:29:24,464 --> 00:29:26,865
Hey, Poupi, if anybody's looking...
When did you shave?

451
00:29:26,985 --> 00:29:30,705
- Never mind. I'm not here, okay? I'm just...
- Georgia. Georgia.

452
00:29:30,825 --> 00:29:32,986
I cannot put up with that twit any longer.

453
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,746
- Why not? I have to.
- Now you're being rude.

454
00:29:35,866 --> 00:29:39,067
Yes, fine, I'm rude and boring
and not funny. Yes, I know!

455
00:29:39,187 --> 00:29:42,827
If you keep that tone with me,
I shall be forced to call your superiors.

456
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,588
Okay, you know what?

457
00:29:44,668 --> 00:29:46,988
If you have a grievance, use these.

458
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:49,989
- Your evaluation forms. Take one.
- Don't think I won't.

459
00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:52,069
I usually hand these out
at the end of the trip.

460
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:54,589
But this will give you four more days
to complain about me.

461
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,630
Hey, hand them out to everybody.

462
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,670
What's Greek for "bipolar"?

463
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,391
Hey. Enough. Your jokes aren't funny.

464
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:10,552
You know, my wife and I have
taken tours for 20 years.

465
00:30:11,072 --> 00:30:13,713
This one, gotta be the worst.

466
00:30:13,793 --> 00:30:15,153
Here we go again. Yeah, yeah,

467
00:30:15,233 --> 00:30:18,633
- I know, yeah, I stink, I wrecked Greece.
- It's the worst because my wife is not here.

468
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:20,994
- And it's just not the same.
- Well, you know what? If I were her,

469
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:22,594
I wouldn't be here with you, either.

470
00:30:22,714 --> 00:30:25,755
I'm sure she's spending her vacation
somewhere...

471
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:38,517
I'm so sorry.

472
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,760
You know what?
I think we should just go shopping.

473
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,241
- Lovely. Just what we wanted, wasn't it?
- Okay.

474
00:31:04,921 --> 00:31:07,161
Nice bit of shopping.
DR. TULLEN: I can finish this later.

475
00:31:07,562 --> 00:31:10,162
- I know a good place for shopping.
- Fine.

476
00:31:13,963 --> 00:31:15,643
Look at this stuff.

477
00:31:17,203 --> 00:31:18,723
No, no, no.

478
00:31:23,044 --> 00:31:23,964
Peekaboo!

479
00:31:28,205 --> 00:31:29,165
Do you like the gold?

480
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:30,845
I love that.

481
00:31:30,965 --> 00:31:35,086
She doesn't have any arms so she makes
up for it by showing her breasts, honey.

482
00:31:35,206 --> 00:31:36,126
Really?

483
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:46,128
Eat hearty, men.

484
00:31:46,248 --> 00:31:49,569
- For tonight we dine in Greece!
- In Greece!

485
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,410
- What was his name?
- Who?

486
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,491
When it's over,
some women cut their hair.

487
00:32:01,611 --> 00:32:03,491
Some women run away to Greece. So...

488
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:06,571
I did not move to Greece
because of some man.

489
00:32:07,411 --> 00:32:09,772
- Why? Who'd you shave for?
- Georgia!

490
00:32:10,692 --> 00:32:11,772
Georgia, come here,
come here, come here!

491
00:32:11,892 --> 00:32:14,253
I don't think I like
what's going on around here.

492
00:32:16,573 --> 00:32:18,573
Georgia! We need you. Just, real...
We need you!

493
00:32:18,693 --> 00:32:20,974
- Okay.
- What did you call my wife?

494
00:32:21,694 --> 00:32:22,894
What's going on? What's going on?

495
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:27,055
Look, this guy here is charging everybody
else one price for the dingle nut

496
00:32:27,135 --> 00:32:30,815
and he's charging me and my wife
two extra euros. That's what, fellow.

497
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:32,336
It's just cultural interaction.

498
00:32:32,456 --> 00:32:35,816
He offers you a price and then
he expects you to offer him a price back.

499
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:38,217
You know, it's just... It's called bargaining.

500
00:32:38,297 --> 00:32:41,017
- It's called "rip-off."
- Thank you very much.

501
00:32:43,377 --> 00:32:45,778
- What did he just call me?
- No, no, no. He wants me to translate.

502
00:32:46,938 --> 00:32:50,499
You fat tourists.

503
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:52,179
My tourist friends.

504
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:54,699
I could give you idiots

505
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:57,140
authentic Greek items made
by my grandmother.

506
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,300
He could give you handmade authentic
items made by his grandmother.

507
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:04,821
But you dummies
want this cheap crap.

508
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:06,301
You have good taste.

509
00:33:06,421 --> 00:33:08,262
This junk is made in Korea.

510
00:33:08,382 --> 00:33:09,542
Things are made in Corinth.

511
00:33:09,662 --> 00:33:11,062
By prisoners.

512
00:33:11,182 --> 00:33:12,542
By friends.

513
00:33:12,662 --> 00:33:13,783
For you, I'll double the price.

514
00:33:13,903 --> 00:33:15,063
I can make you a good price.

515
00:33:15,183 --> 00:33:17,783
Yeah, that's what we want
right there, fellow.

516
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:20,184
And to your guide, a kickback.

517
00:33:20,304 --> 00:33:21,264
What?

518
00:33:21,344 --> 00:33:23,504
Kick back and enjoy your stay.

519
00:33:24,064 --> 00:33:25,224
- Okay?
- Okay.

520
00:33:25,344 --> 00:33:26,265
How much do you want for it?

521
00:33:26,345 --> 00:33:27,545
Twenty Euros.

522
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:28,625
20 euros.

523
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:31,145
- Is that good?
- Yeah, now that sounds more reasonable.

524
00:33:31,265 --> 00:33:32,346
- Okay.
- Okay.

525
00:33:32,466 --> 00:33:33,786
Okay. Okay.

526
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,548
- Nobody touches Big Al's hottie.
- Thank you.

527
00:33:43,668 --> 00:33:45,468
- Dirty greaseball.
- Bye.

528
00:33:47,788 --> 00:33:49,469
How much are these?

529
00:33:49,589 --> 00:33:53,789
Oh, good heavens. They're far too
expensive. Can't possibly afford that.

530
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,951
Oh, yeah, we're getting checked out, dude.

531
00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:05,791
- Really?
- Yeah, the Spanish divorcees.

532
00:34:06,631 --> 00:34:10,592
It's only a matter of time before
they start coming around. Hello.

533
00:34:11,752 --> 00:34:13,593
- Dude, behind you.
- What?

534
00:34:14,993 --> 00:34:17,953
They're checking out
the community shower thing.

535
00:34:19,394 --> 00:34:21,474
It's like Fourth of July
at Elton John's house.

536
00:34:21,554 --> 00:34:23,434
Okay. They want a show?

537
00:34:23,514 --> 00:34:26,795
Let's show the Spaniards
a little American showmanship.

538
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:49,879
It doesn't count
if you're on vacation, right?

539
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,480
What is it with tourists and ice cream?

540
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,000
They had some this morning,
then again after lunch,

541
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,041
and now again with the $4 cones.
I don't get it. You, too?

542
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:08,162
- No, thank you.
- This for you to give to him.

543
00:35:15,923 --> 00:35:17,163
Okay, fine.

544
00:35:26,685 --> 00:35:28,485
I sort of got you this.

545
00:35:29,965 --> 00:35:31,726
Thanks, but no thanks.

546
00:35:37,847 --> 00:35:39,287
That is tasty.

547
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:56,850
I'm sorry about this morning.

548
00:36:02,171 --> 00:36:05,531
You know, I was a much nicer guy
when my wife was alive.

549
00:36:07,172 --> 00:36:09,052
She died three years ago.

550
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:14,133
She used to say to me,
"They don't know you're kidding, Irv."

551
00:36:16,293 --> 00:36:20,534
She would say, "You're not as funny
as you think you are," just like you.

552
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:24,534
It's nice you had a good marriage.

553
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:26,535
We fought every day.

554
00:36:27,455 --> 00:36:29,975
I took her to Egypt. We fought all day

555
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:35,256
about whether the pyramids
were "majestic" or "magnificent."

556
00:36:38,057 --> 00:36:39,417
It was magic.

557
00:36:41,697 --> 00:36:43,418
Twenty-eight years.

558
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:48,538
I woke up every day smiling.

559
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:52,819
- I could live with that.
- You got the potential.

560
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:57,380
All you gotta do is let it happen.
You know, relax. Open up.

561
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,461
- I'm open.
- You're open? Look at you.

562
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:05,141
You're as tight as my Aunt Gladys' ass.

563
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:08,702
- Hey.
- Open up. Open.

564
00:37:10,782 --> 00:37:14,583
- Be alert. Be like...
- Like this. Like this?

565
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:18,143
Okay. I'm open, yay!

566
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:20,624
Oh, no, no!

567
00:37:21,544 --> 00:37:24,104
Come on, Irv, look what you made me do.

568
00:37:26,145 --> 00:37:29,345
- Okay, that's a keeper.
- Okay. So here's what we do.

569
00:37:29,425 --> 00:37:32,546
You get some kerosene.
You pour it on the stain.

570
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,586
- Yeah.
- Keep it there for about an hour.

571
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:35,626
Mmm-hmm.

572
00:37:35,746 --> 00:37:39,067
And then you light that sucker on fire
and buy something nice.

573
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:39,907
And then you light that sucker on fire
and buy something nice.

574
00:37:40,587 --> 00:37:43,068
All right. I have to gather the group.

575
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,788
- We're good?
- We're better.

576
00:37:48,588 --> 00:37:49,589
Okay.

577
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:54,629
Group B! Group B, everybody.

578
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:59,030
Everybody. I hope everyone enjoyed their
ice cream. I ate some. I'm wearing some.

579
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,631
Let's get on the bus and sweat it off.

580
00:38:02,471 --> 00:38:04,791
Has anybody seen Dorcas? Anybody?

581
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:07,232
All right. We'll wait for her.

582
00:38:20,394 --> 00:38:24,234
I'd like to apologize for
my unprofessional attitude this morning.

583
00:38:24,554 --> 00:38:28,595
Have you ever had one of those days?
Actually, it's been about a year.

584
00:38:28,915 --> 00:38:30,595
- Yes, Irv.
- Me, too.

585
00:38:31,116 --> 00:38:34,796
I would like to apologize to everybody.
It was my medication.

586
00:38:34,876 --> 00:38:37,517
I take Preparation H, 'cause I'm an asshole.

587
00:38:39,237 --> 00:38:41,757
Wait for me. Thank you, Georgie.

588
00:38:41,877 --> 00:38:45,918
I'm the last one. Okay, Poupi, let's go.
Ooh! I'm spent!

589
00:38:47,118 --> 00:38:49,079
I got these for you, girls.

590
00:38:49,879 --> 00:38:53,639
- It's too much.
- No. They cost nothing.

591
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,401
Drive, Poupi, drive!

592
00:39:09,562 --> 00:39:12,522
Hey! Who's seen the Olympics on TV?

593
00:39:15,763 --> 00:39:19,324
Well, we're going to Olympia,
the site of the very first Olympics.

594
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:22,004
The ancient games began in 776 B.C.

595
00:39:22,524 --> 00:39:24,364
Now, all through the era of the Pisatans...

596
00:39:24,444 --> 00:39:27,525
Flapjack, you want to race me
Michael Johnson style?

597
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:29,925
...the Olympic games took place
every five years.

598
00:39:31,126 --> 00:39:32,406
Here's something interesting.

599
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:36,086
Until they were abolished
from 393 until 426 A.D.

600
00:39:37,087 --> 00:39:38,807
And then in 1896...

601
00:39:40,527 --> 00:39:43,448
Well, that's about the year
I started to stink.

602
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:01,171
I know every fact and every figure
about this place.

603
00:40:01,571 --> 00:40:04,571
I mean, I love it here.
And they just want to have fun.

604
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:07,092
And I get it,
but I don't know how to make this job fun.

605
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:09,852
Well, if you call it a job, it ain't fun.

606
00:40:10,372 --> 00:40:14,253
I mean, look at porn stars. They get to
schtup all day. They should be happy.

607
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:16,893
You never hear about a happy porn star.

608
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:19,974
I had the best job in the whole world.

609
00:40:22,054 --> 00:40:23,774
You were a porn star?

610
00:40:27,335 --> 00:40:30,295
- No, really, were you?
- I was an ice-cream taster.

611
00:40:30,415 --> 00:40:33,256
- Get out.
- Thirty-five years.

612
00:40:33,856 --> 00:40:37,377
- I wish I had that job.
- That's what my friends used to say.

613
00:40:38,097 --> 00:40:41,977
But then Elinor got sick.

614
00:40:44,178 --> 00:40:46,498
I had to take care of her and...

615
00:40:47,618 --> 00:40:49,979
She always wanted to come to Greece.

616
00:40:54,339 --> 00:40:58,620
Hey. Yesterday, I quit. This is my last tour.

617
00:41:02,021 --> 00:41:04,781
Well, it's my last tour, too.

618
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:13,263
Georgie! How did these columns fall over?

619
00:41:13,783 --> 00:41:16,143
Well, there were two earthquakes
in the 5th and 6th century...

620
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:23,024
The columns fell over from the incredible
pull of Ulysses' love.

621
00:41:23,424 --> 00:41:24,384
Oh!

622
00:41:24,464 --> 00:41:26,265
Isn't that sweet?

623
00:41:29,265 --> 00:41:30,946
- Better.
- Better?

624
00:41:31,026 --> 00:41:33,426
Looks like a short stack fell over.

625
00:41:33,906 --> 00:41:35,386
Come on, Barnaby.

626
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:45,068
Hey, does everybody know
about the Olympic torch?

627
00:41:45,188 --> 00:41:46,628
This way. Come on, this way.

628
00:41:46,748 --> 00:41:50,149
Okay. That flame that you saw
being passed around the world

629
00:41:50,269 --> 00:41:52,949
is first lit by a reflection from the sun.

630
00:41:53,629 --> 00:41:56,950
All right, now, this is the palestra.

631
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:00,350
This is where the athletes would wrestle.

632
00:42:19,034 --> 00:42:20,194
What?

633
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:23,314
Do you need anything?
Medicine or anything at all?

634
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,075
Doing okay? Hey!

635
00:42:27,515 --> 00:42:30,916
- You really are listening to nothing.
- The battery died.

636
00:42:31,556 --> 00:42:33,316
We forgot the charger.

637
00:42:34,796 --> 00:42:36,316
This trip sucks.

638
00:42:37,437 --> 00:42:38,557
Caitlin?

639
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,718
It's okay. And I understand.

640
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:46,038
- What is it you understand?
- Oh, well...

641
00:42:46,638 --> 00:42:48,999
- The genetic thing.
- What thing?

642
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,959
Sorry, your husband told me
about the thing

643
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:54,319
that makes your daughter prickly.

644
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,920
Hansdorf syndrome.

645
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,841
Hansdorf is my maiden name.

646
00:43:09,722 --> 00:43:11,482
That's a coincidence.

647
00:43:12,643 --> 00:43:13,763
DR. TULLEN: Stuart.

648
00:43:14,003 --> 00:43:16,043
How dare you insult me
in front of that woman?

649
00:43:16,163 --> 00:43:17,523
It was a joke, dear. Good heavens!

650
00:43:17,603 --> 00:43:19,724
- DR. TULLEN: How could you possibly say...
- Why don't you just lighten up?

651
00:43:41,647 --> 00:43:44,448
Beautiful ladies,
don't forget to smash the plates.

652
00:43:44,568 --> 00:43:46,088
- Yeah?
- Very Greek.

653
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:47,888
Everybody. Everybody.

654
00:43:48,248 --> 00:43:50,969
The newspaper says
it's gonna rain tomorrow.

655
00:43:52,889 --> 00:43:54,089
And the good part is?

656
00:43:54,209 --> 00:43:56,970
If we all think good thoughts,
maybe we'll get some nice weather.

657
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,130
Are you listening, God?

658
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,731
You don't have to shout,
I'm sitting right here.

659
00:44:00,811 --> 00:44:04,931
Blue skies shining on me

660
00:44:06,572 --> 00:44:07,532
One, two, three!

661
00:44:09,652 --> 00:44:10,652
No!

662
00:44:11,092 --> 00:44:12,332
- Here you go.
- Come on!

663
00:44:12,453 --> 00:44:14,293
No, no, no!

664
00:44:15,373 --> 00:44:19,094
I'm ever so sorry,
but that Nico said it was a Greek tradition.

665
00:44:19,854 --> 00:44:21,854
- It's okay.
- Okay.

666
00:44:23,734 --> 00:44:25,775
Kimmy, stop doing the dishes
and get over here.

667
00:44:25,895 --> 00:44:28,135
Sue, bung your Khy Pass over here,
have a crack at the foosball.

668
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:32,936
- 10 euros.
- Don't worry. Leave it to me.

669
00:44:36,016 --> 00:44:40,217
I say, that was ever such fun.
We did enjoy it. You are wonderful.

670
00:44:40,337 --> 00:44:42,978
Hello. Hello, lovely lady. Thank you.

671
00:44:43,698 --> 00:44:45,018
Silly twit.

672
00:44:49,259 --> 00:44:52,819
Dorcas, here's the deal.
You gotta stop with the stealing.

673
00:44:53,739 --> 00:44:56,300
- I'm sorry.
- Okay. Okay.

674
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,901
Okay. You're a lovely woman.
I really don't mean to judge in any way.

675
00:45:02,261 --> 00:45:03,981
It's just that people are going to
start to notice...

676
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,822
That's my cell phone.
And somehow, you got it out of here.

677
00:45:06,902 --> 00:45:09,502
I just want to ask... Wow! You're good.

678
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,463
Actually, it was only 10.

679
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:16,423
Well, waste not, want not, is what I say.

680
00:45:16,703 --> 00:45:17,943
All right.

681
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:26,745
Nothing but blue skies
from now on

682
00:45:28,745 --> 00:45:31,026
I wish I could be happy like you.

683
00:45:31,306 --> 00:45:33,666
God, you've gotta get more sex.

684
00:45:34,226 --> 00:45:37,067
- Irv...
- I'm sorry, but what is it with you?

685
00:45:37,147 --> 00:45:38,987
Don't you have a boyfriend?

686
00:45:39,067 --> 00:45:41,147
I'm on a tour bus, like, six days a week.

687
00:45:41,267 --> 00:45:44,868
Well, you gotta get in touch
with your wild thing.

688
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:49,469
I think we can get in here
and just touch on everything...

689
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:52,749
Actually, there's someone
I'm kind of interested in.

690
00:45:53,469 --> 00:45:54,710
At the bar.

691
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:59,790
- Yes.
- Really?

692
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,151
Go for it.

693
00:46:10,152 --> 00:46:12,953
Just make sure it's zoned for a parking lot.

694
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:18,274
I like daisies.

695
00:46:19,994 --> 00:46:21,594
I'll call you back.

696
00:46:21,794 --> 00:46:23,034
So do I.

697
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:25,595
Two Metaxa tonics, Nick.

698
00:46:25,675 --> 00:46:26,075
So you work at an IHOP?

699
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:27,475
So you work at an IHOP?

700
00:46:28,155 --> 00:46:30,796
Yeah, well, I mean, that makes it sound
like I'm a waiter, you know.

701
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:33,196
I'm the number one
corporate representative for IHOP.

702
00:46:33,316 --> 00:46:35,716
I sold 100 franchises last year.

703
00:46:35,836 --> 00:46:39,197
We're expanding Ohio,
if you're looking for an investment.

704
00:46:39,317 --> 00:46:41,277
How do we say, "Cheers"?

705
00:46:42,037 --> 00:46:43,558
We say, "ya mas, to our health."

706
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,679
So what do you do for fun?

707
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:53,199
For fun?

708
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,800
Syrup.

709
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,081
I collect vintage syrups.

710
00:47:02,001 --> 00:47:06,322
Yeah. Some people are
into art or wines, you know.

711
00:47:06,442 --> 00:47:09,442
I'm into vintage syrups.
Not too old. When you say "vintage,"

712
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:12,323
you think, "Oh, my God,
the guy's drinking syrup from 1912."

713
00:47:12,443 --> 00:47:14,843
No. The oldest I have is 1948.

714
00:47:14,963 --> 00:47:17,963
So it's post-war, but it's still really special.

715
00:47:18,123 --> 00:47:21,604
I mean, it's still edible. You can pote it.
It's potent, potable? Potable?

716
00:47:21,724 --> 00:47:22,684
I never watch Jeopardy!

717
00:47:22,764 --> 00:47:25,365
Anyway, so the thing that
I like about syrup is it's sweet,

718
00:47:25,485 --> 00:47:26,845
no matter how bad your day is.

719
00:47:26,925 --> 00:47:30,045
...a German waffle,
but there's also a French crepe.

720
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:31,726
I mean, we had to have
a whole meeting in Iowa,

721
00:47:31,846 --> 00:47:33,926
because the waitresses
were calling them "craps."

722
00:47:34,006 --> 00:47:37,247
And no one wants to eat crap
so much anymore.

723
00:47:37,327 --> 00:47:38,447
Sometimes in Mississippi.

724
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:40,527
But usually you find that
people don't want to have

725
00:47:40,647 --> 00:47:43,928
a food that's not appetizingly named,
you know.

726
00:47:44,048 --> 00:47:47,408
That's why I love any kind
of an international flair.

727
00:47:47,528 --> 00:47:51,289
Swedish crepes. It just automatically
sounds better. It's exotic.

728
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:55,170
My favorite, though, natural.
Pecans, coconut, which is so, so good.

729
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:59,130
It's very, very fattening, and... Not that
I have anything against fat people.

730
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,051
Fat people are our biggest demographic.

731
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:03,691
I bought two houses in Florida
off of fat people. God bless them.

732
00:48:15,853 --> 00:48:20,214
- MR. TULLEN: Good morning.
- Good morning. Hi. Good morning.

733
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:21,254
Mmm-hmm.

734
00:48:22,574 --> 00:48:26,335
Georgia. Did I see you on a date last night?

735
00:48:27,215 --> 00:48:30,736
- How was it?
- Well, I now know the history of syrup.

736
00:48:30,816 --> 00:48:32,296
Hey, that was fun last night.

737
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:34,736
- Maple trees rock.
- Yeah, they do.

738
00:48:35,176 --> 00:48:36,097
Mmm-hmm.

739
00:48:36,537 --> 00:48:39,337
Please, to the left here,
thank you very much.

740
00:48:39,897 --> 00:48:41,417
I see you enjoy Greece, eh?

741
00:48:41,497 --> 00:48:43,298
- Yeah.
- Yeah? For you.

742
00:48:43,738 --> 00:48:44,738
Thanks!

743
00:48:44,858 --> 00:48:47,698
Hey, listen, I can't buy for everybody, so...

744
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:50,779
- Yeah. What does it say?
- "I love Greece."

745
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:56,180
I do, bro! Awesome! Thank you, man!

746
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,980
- Let me help you.
- Pardon?

747
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,101
I'm just helping you.

748
00:49:00,221 --> 00:49:02,061
- Louder, please.
- I'm just helping you.

749
00:49:02,141 --> 00:49:04,941
- No! I can manage. Really.
- Okay.

750
00:49:05,021 --> 00:49:06,742
- Thank you.
- All right.

751
00:49:08,942 --> 00:49:11,222
Your group. Losers.

752
00:49:13,343 --> 00:49:14,623
"What? What?"

753
00:49:17,703 --> 00:49:19,384
"So hot. So hot."

754
00:49:19,464 --> 00:49:21,424
"How much is this? How much is that?"

755
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:32,386
Hello, everybody.

756
00:49:32,506 --> 00:49:33,506
Hey!

757
00:49:34,626 --> 00:49:37,267
Don't diss my group. They're nice people.

758
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:41,587
It's so cold in here.

759
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:50,749
That's everyone. Except the Americans.

760
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:54,750
Al, just think. This course
could be thousands of years old.

761
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:59,230
Well, I wonder if Jesus ever played here.

762
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,191
Big Al. Kim.

763
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:06,712
You know how you like to get up
in front of everybody and bore us?

764
00:50:06,792 --> 00:50:08,312
Please go on.

765
00:50:08,392 --> 00:50:12,553
I have a very exciting idea.
Why don't you try entertaining everybody?

766
00:50:12,673 --> 00:50:14,113
Irv, how am I gonna do that?

767
00:50:14,233 --> 00:50:17,273
History has got a lot of dirty stories.

768
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:20,754
Sex sells.

769
00:50:31,436 --> 00:50:33,796
Well, it turned out to be
a beautiful day.

770
00:50:34,676 --> 00:50:36,797
Thanks for the nice weather, Irv.

771
00:50:38,237 --> 00:50:39,197
Good on you, Irv.

772
00:50:39,317 --> 00:50:43,078
I thought you were joking last night.
You got some power, fellow.

773
00:50:43,198 --> 00:50:46,278
Irv, do you think you could bless Barnaby?

774
00:50:46,358 --> 00:50:48,599
Maybe he'd move a bit faster.

775
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:52,919
I bless you in the name of Socrates,
Hippocrates and feta cheese.

776
00:50:53,479 --> 00:50:55,360
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

777
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,040
This is appropriate,
because we're headed to Delphi,

778
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,761
which is the most mystical spot
in all of Greece.

779
00:51:00,881 --> 00:51:04,601
In ancient times, the oracle of Delphi
would answer questions

780
00:51:04,721 --> 00:51:08,282
for kings and commoners, like,
"Who should I vote for?"

781
00:51:09,402 --> 00:51:11,082
Or other stuff.

782
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:17,483
Like, "Shall I take a lover?"

783
00:51:17,603 --> 00:51:19,564
- Hey, look out.
- Hello.

784
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,444
That's what we're talking about.

785
00:51:22,844 --> 00:51:25,685
- Now, the oracle was a virgin.
- Here we go.

786
00:51:25,805 --> 00:51:29,645
And she was dressed in flowing gowns
of sheer silk.

787
00:51:30,926 --> 00:51:33,446
Some say she wore nothing at all.

788
00:51:33,526 --> 00:51:35,046
Hey, I like that.

789
00:51:36,047 --> 00:51:37,087
Oh, my.

790
00:51:37,167 --> 00:51:39,447
And then she would inhale
the sacred vapors.

791
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:42,408
- Louder, please.
- And she would go into raptures.

792
00:51:42,488 --> 00:51:46,568
- Louder.
- She would say, "Oh, Zeus, take my body.

793
00:51:47,288 --> 00:51:51,129
"Oh, Zeus, fill me with your wisdom.

794
00:51:51,689 --> 00:51:55,210
"Oh, Zeus, my body is your vessel.

795
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,251
"Take me! Take me! Take me!"

796
00:52:04,571 --> 00:52:05,812
Poupi!

797
00:52:17,173 --> 00:52:19,214
- Caitlin, are you all right?
- I dropped my phone.

798
00:52:19,294 --> 00:52:20,654
- Everybody all right?
- Yeah.

799
00:52:20,734 --> 00:52:23,975
Alive! Alive! Please, alive, everybody.

800
00:52:27,095 --> 00:52:28,375
Okay. Okay.

801
00:52:28,735 --> 00:52:30,856
Everybody, let's get off the bus, okay?
Everybody.

802
00:52:31,496 --> 00:52:33,016
Okay, it's gonna be
about 20 more minutes.

803
00:52:33,136 --> 00:52:36,017
Irv, Olga, Svetlana? You okay?
You're alive.

804
00:52:37,177 --> 00:52:39,057
- Is everybody okay?
- Everybody's fine.

805
00:52:39,177 --> 00:52:41,978
Everybody's fine,
and we got a good story out of it.

806
00:52:42,098 --> 00:52:44,978
You know, this whole thing happened
'cause he was staring at you, Angie.

807
00:52:45,098 --> 00:52:48,379
- Who?
- Poupi. Up there.

808
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:51,939
Creepy driver, checking out the goats.

809
00:52:52,179 --> 00:52:55,500
Angie, everyone on the bus
has a different word for it.

810
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,700
I call it "mysterious."

811
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,541
Personally, I think he shaved his neck
just for you.

812
00:53:00,621 --> 00:53:03,181
- What?
- He's a nice guy, go talk to him.

813
00:53:03,301 --> 00:53:05,181
Yeah, he's quiet, but he's nice.

814
00:53:05,301 --> 00:53:08,742
Fine. Yeah, sometimes he's nice,
but mostly he just makes me mad.

815
00:53:08,862 --> 00:53:11,823
Hot, not mad.
It's been so long, you forgot the difference.

816
00:53:11,943 --> 00:53:14,463
- Okay. Smile, he feels terrible.
- Come on.

817
00:53:14,543 --> 00:53:16,663
He's the one not wearing the bell.

818
00:53:16,743 --> 00:53:18,464
- Work it. Whoo!
- Kimmy.

819
00:53:33,066 --> 00:53:34,826
Sorry about your bus.

820
00:53:36,907 --> 00:53:41,147
You distracted me.
I could have killed you. All of us.

821
00:53:41,748 --> 00:53:44,468
- I was just trying to have fun.
- Oh, well...

822
00:53:46,508 --> 00:53:48,229
That's good, I guess.

823
00:53:50,469 --> 00:53:51,869
The first day,

824
00:53:52,949 --> 00:53:56,670
you asked me if I wonder
what I'm doing with my life. Right?

825
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:58,830
- Yeah.
- Maybe I can explain.

826
00:54:00,591 --> 00:54:02,551
What do you call that guy?

827
00:54:03,151 --> 00:54:07,312
He goes in front of people
and waves his dick around.

828
00:54:08,432 --> 00:54:10,312
We called him Uncle Phil.

829
00:54:10,992 --> 00:54:12,873
What? No. No.

830
00:54:13,153 --> 00:54:15,273
He's in front of the people
who play the music.

831
00:54:15,353 --> 00:54:17,634
Stick! That's a conductor.

832
00:54:17,714 --> 00:54:20,354
Right. Right. A conductor. He comes out.

833
00:54:21,114 --> 00:54:23,354
- He waves his stick.
- His stick.

834
00:54:23,955 --> 00:54:27,595
And people get to hear
the most beautiful sounds in the world.

835
00:54:28,075 --> 00:54:32,076
He hears the music up close.
He feels it in his bones.

836
00:54:33,196 --> 00:54:35,957
And that's what my job is like. I sit there.

837
00:54:36,277 --> 00:54:39,077
I turn the wheel this way. Turn that way.

838
00:54:39,397 --> 00:54:42,958
And before me comes this great vision.
Always beautiful.

839
00:54:44,278 --> 00:54:45,798
The scenery

840
00:54:47,198 --> 00:54:49,959
is frozen.

841
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,479
Frozen music.

842
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,000
And you know what I like?

843
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,440
You got the best seat in the house.

844
00:55:00,441 --> 00:55:01,441
Yes.

845
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:25,365
Thank you.

846
00:55:26,445 --> 00:55:28,845
I like your passion for our history.

847
00:55:29,405 --> 00:55:31,606
But you are too busy looking up.

848
00:55:33,526 --> 00:55:34,806
Look here.

849
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:41,327
I know, I'm touching your chests.

850
00:55:41,728 --> 00:55:42,888
Good.

851
00:55:52,369 --> 00:55:55,210
What happened with the pancake man
last night?

852
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:56,450
Nothing.

853
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:58,890
Good.

854
00:56:04,451 --> 00:56:05,852
Yeah!

855
00:56:16,213 --> 00:56:18,214
You can do it. Come on.

856
00:56:20,614 --> 00:56:23,695
Take deep breaths of
the healing powers of Delphi.

857
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:26,335
Better than my workout at Curves.

858
00:56:27,255 --> 00:56:29,656
- Trick or treat?
- It's quite good, actually.

859
00:56:29,736 --> 00:56:31,416
- Come on.
- Georgia,

860
00:56:32,216 --> 00:56:35,016
it's beautiful, but, come on,
so is an escalator.

861
00:56:35,096 --> 00:56:37,257
This is a very spiritual place.

862
00:56:37,337 --> 00:56:40,457
You can actually feel the energy
coming from the ground.

863
00:56:40,537 --> 00:56:43,658
Do you feel it? This is the temple of Apollo

864
00:56:44,538 --> 00:56:46,738
and the sanctuary of the oracle.

865
00:56:47,098 --> 00:56:48,539
Come on, Barnaby.

866
00:56:48,779 --> 00:56:51,579
Now, the Pythia, or the oracle,
was hidden from everyone

867
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:55,300
except for the high priest.
And she would crouch behind him,

868
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,620
she was hidden,
and she would answer questions.

869
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,821
Like, she would go,

870
00:57:01,261 --> 00:57:04,381
"The oracle is in. Any questions?"

871
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:06,462
Wasn't she a virgin?

872
00:57:07,582 --> 00:57:09,142
- How's that?
- Yeah.

873
00:57:09,822 --> 00:57:11,663
Then maybe you better do it.

874
00:57:11,743 --> 00:57:14,023
Yeah, go on Irv. You go in there.

875
00:57:14,623 --> 00:57:17,183
You can't spell virgin without l-R-V.

876
00:57:18,464 --> 00:57:21,264
All right,
the oracle is open.

877
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:22,704
- Anybody got a question?
- Yes.

878
00:57:22,784 --> 00:57:25,465
Are my legs good enough for a miniskirt?

879
00:57:26,145 --> 00:57:27,705
Hubba-hubba.

880
00:57:28,585 --> 00:57:30,506
I've got a serious question.

881
00:57:30,626 --> 00:57:32,706
Am I ever gonna get
cell reception up here?

882
00:57:32,826 --> 00:57:35,587
Turn the damn phone off.
This is a vacation.

883
00:57:36,147 --> 00:57:38,347
- I know that. All right.
- Guys.

884
00:57:38,587 --> 00:57:40,347
She's got one. Yeah.

885
00:57:41,388 --> 00:57:43,548
Why did my husband cheat on me?

886
00:57:44,228 --> 00:57:46,148
It wasn't you he cheated.

887
00:57:46,868 --> 00:57:51,229
Some men cheat themselves
out of living a life with a woman they love.

888
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:54,590
Thank you.

889
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:57,710
Okay.

890
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:01,671
I've always wanted to start a family, but...

891
00:58:02,991 --> 00:58:05,992
Well, Big Al is
just gonna come out and say it.

892
00:58:07,072 --> 00:58:08,392
I'm scared.

893
00:58:09,632 --> 00:58:12,513
Being a parent is the best thing
in the world.

894
00:58:12,913 --> 00:58:16,713
And I guarantee you,
you're gonna be a great dad.

895
00:58:18,474 --> 00:58:20,074
- See?
- Thanks, Irv.

896
00:58:20,634 --> 00:58:24,315
Irvacle. What is it? Orvacle.

897
00:58:24,395 --> 00:58:25,835
Well, go on, Caitlin, ask a question.

898
00:58:25,915 --> 00:58:27,795
- Go on. Go on.
- No.

899
00:58:29,516 --> 00:58:30,916
Will my daughter ever stop sulking?

900
00:58:31,036 --> 00:58:33,396
Will my parents ever stop fighting?

901
00:58:34,116 --> 00:58:37,117
Parents sometimes forget
that they're an example.

902
00:58:43,598 --> 00:58:44,838
Thank you.

903
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:49,159
Look, basically,
I gotta take a Johnny Riddle.

904
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:50,839
Siph the pyth.

905
00:58:50,959 --> 00:58:52,439
- Where's the gents'?
- Yeah.

906
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,920
- Oh! The men's room.
- Yeah. God.

907
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,360
It's right up there. Oracle closed.

908
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,321
Yay! Good job.

909
00:59:04,681 --> 00:59:07,442
I got a bar. I got a bar! I lost it.

910
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:23,925
Hi, Oracle.

911
00:59:25,325 --> 00:59:29,326
I can't start something when
I'm about to leave this country. Right?

912
00:59:29,686 --> 00:59:32,046
- I mean, it's...
- What are you doing?

913
00:59:32,526 --> 00:59:34,486
I'm looking for something.

914
00:59:35,006 --> 00:59:37,207
- What?
- My dignity.

915
00:59:39,447 --> 00:59:40,527
- Georgia.
- What?

916
00:59:40,607 --> 00:59:44,928
You're looking for obstacles
rather than looking for magic.

917
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:03,491
- This place is great.
- I felt a vibe.

918
01:00:03,651 --> 01:00:05,372
I'm so happy to hear that.

919
01:00:05,492 --> 01:00:07,412
Barnaby, do come on.

920
01:00:08,572 --> 01:00:10,132
Oh, my God!

921
01:00:12,013 --> 01:00:13,453
Barnaby!

922
01:00:13,533 --> 01:00:15,893
- What?
- Barnaby!

923
01:00:15,973 --> 01:00:17,374
What? What?

924
01:00:17,494 --> 01:00:19,774
He hasn't got his walker.

925
01:00:23,255 --> 01:00:25,175
It's the healing powers of Delphi.

926
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:27,215
No, it was Irv.

927
01:00:27,295 --> 01:00:29,976
You heard him bless Barnaby on the bus.

928
01:00:30,056 --> 01:00:31,896
He's a miracle worker.

929
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:34,296
Maybe he's a god of Delphi.

930
01:00:34,656 --> 01:00:37,617
I'm not a god.
That's just a rumor my mother started.

931
01:00:39,857 --> 01:00:42,458
- Okay.
- To the bus!

932
01:00:42,578 --> 01:00:45,658
- To the bus!
- Irvinator.

933
01:00:49,539 --> 01:00:51,419
Sexy! Very nice.

934
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,460
- Let's go again!
- Again! Again!

935
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:58,580
I've never even seen
this kind of alcohol before!

936
01:01:06,502 --> 01:01:08,662
- You look beautiful!
- Oh! Thank you.

937
01:01:08,742 --> 01:01:10,742
- Is it new?
- No, I had it.

938
01:01:12,223 --> 01:01:13,863
Do I have a tag? Anywhere?

939
01:01:13,983 --> 01:01:15,223
- No.
- Okay.

940
01:01:16,783 --> 01:01:17,904
Poupi?

941
01:01:20,104 --> 01:01:22,704
You ever kill a man?

942
01:01:30,786 --> 01:01:31,906
- He nodded.
- He didn't nod!

943
01:01:32,026 --> 01:01:33,546
- I saw him nod.
- Look, a nod is that.

944
01:01:33,666 --> 01:01:35,947
- That's $700.
- He didn't... No. Bet's off.

945
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,467
No, I saw him nod.

946
01:01:39,107 --> 01:01:40,988
You looking for somebody?

947
01:01:42,348 --> 01:01:43,348
No.

948
01:01:43,628 --> 01:01:45,388
Really? Me, neither.

949
01:01:49,869 --> 01:01:55,430
Irv, don't you think everyone in the group
seems healthier and alive?

950
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:58,710
- Yes, I do.
- It's Delphi.

951
01:02:00,871 --> 01:02:02,471
Or maybe you're God?

952
01:02:02,591 --> 01:02:03,711
- Georgia.
- Yeah?

953
01:02:03,791 --> 01:02:06,472
I haven't made a number two
since Chicago.

954
01:02:06,632 --> 01:02:09,192
If I was God, I would fix that first.

955
01:02:09,272 --> 01:02:11,593
Okay, maybe you're not the God,
but maybe you're a Greek god.

956
01:02:11,673 --> 01:02:12,913
Like Zeus or Apollo.

957
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:14,113
- That's true.
- Yeah.

958
01:02:14,193 --> 01:02:16,033
- No, no. No, I'm Zeus.
- I knew it.

959
01:02:16,113 --> 01:02:19,114
I'm Zeus.
I'm casting a spell on you and Poupi.

960
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:23,595
- Irv, you know what? I can't.
- That's it.

961
01:02:23,955 --> 01:02:25,795
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to bed.

962
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:29,716
But the guy that you're not looking for
went that way.

963
01:02:30,676 --> 01:02:31,756
- Okay.
- Georgia.

964
01:02:31,876 --> 01:02:32,876
What?

965
01:02:33,476 --> 01:02:35,597
I think you have a bigger problem.

966
01:02:35,677 --> 01:02:37,077
Yeah, Greece!

967
01:02:39,837 --> 01:02:40,757
Oh!

968
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:48,079
Oh...

969
01:02:52,119 --> 01:02:53,480
Hey, Gator!

970
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,800
Hey! Georgia!

971
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,680
Georgia, I've been kicking
these guys' asses!

972
01:02:58,881 --> 01:03:00,761
- Asses!
- Asses.

973
01:03:01,481 --> 01:03:02,961
Hey, where'd you get this shirt?

974
01:03:03,081 --> 01:03:04,441
- You like it?
- Yeah.

975
01:03:04,561 --> 01:03:06,442
- That guy Nico gave it to me.
- Yeah.

976
01:03:06,522 --> 01:03:08,962
- He's so cool!
- And it's got Greek writing on it.

977
01:03:09,082 --> 01:03:12,163
- Yeah! It's got, "I love Greece!"
- Yeah, it says...

978
01:03:23,445 --> 01:03:24,725
Excuse me.

979
01:03:24,925 --> 01:03:27,565
- Greek toes taste funny to you, hey?
- Yes.

980
01:03:28,685 --> 01:03:29,646
No, no, no, no.

981
01:03:30,806 --> 01:03:31,726
Orgy!

982
01:03:32,566 --> 01:03:34,246
I get the tour guide!

983
01:03:36,207 --> 01:03:37,287
Gator!

984
01:03:39,367 --> 01:03:40,768
Fifty on Gator.

985
01:03:40,928 --> 01:03:42,008
Gator!

986
01:04:04,011 --> 01:04:06,092
- Hello.
- Hello.

987
01:04:07,332 --> 01:04:09,052
- You want to sit?
- Yes.

988
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:11,133
- Let me.
- Thank you.

989
01:04:14,053 --> 01:04:19,774
I just wanted to tell you that I really liked
what you said today about driving the bus.

990
01:04:22,855 --> 01:04:24,295
It was poetry.

991
01:04:24,415 --> 01:04:26,615
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes.

992
01:04:26,695 --> 01:04:30,656
- Where did you learn English?
- I rode my motorcycle across England.

993
01:04:32,176 --> 01:04:33,456
Of course.

994
01:04:34,376 --> 01:04:36,577
Wait. What should we drink to?

995
01:04:37,657 --> 01:04:39,857
It's my birthday in six months.

996
01:04:40,778 --> 01:04:42,178
You will be 25?

997
01:04:43,058 --> 01:04:44,418
Yes, I will.

998
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:56,340
So... Oh!

999
01:05:02,701 --> 01:05:06,542
Thank you. I should eat more fruit.
It's healthy.

1000
01:05:09,102 --> 01:05:10,623
It's really good.

1001
01:05:13,463 --> 01:05:16,423
So I just wanted to tell you...

1002
01:05:18,704 --> 01:05:22,024
You're such a nice guy. And I'm...
Okay, look.

1003
01:05:23,985 --> 01:05:25,585
This can't happen.

1004
01:05:25,705 --> 01:05:28,986
But it must.
You said you haven't made love in forever.

1005
01:05:29,946 --> 01:05:31,826
Yeah, when I thought
you didn't speak English.

1006
01:05:31,906 --> 01:05:34,827
You know what?
I've decided I'm leaving Greece,

1007
01:05:35,187 --> 01:05:37,587
because this whole moving here
was an experiment

1008
01:05:37,707 --> 01:05:40,067
to be brave and spontaneous, and...

1009
01:05:42,588 --> 01:05:43,628
Okay.

1010
01:05:49,509 --> 01:05:52,590
You know,
this whole impulsive and crazy and,

1011
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:55,470
you know, jump into a thing, thing?

1012
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:57,710
- Georgia?
- Yeah?

1013
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:00,271
Your butt is too small.

1014
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,151
That did it.

1015
01:06:28,556 --> 01:06:31,596
Is this the first time you made love
to a tour guide?

1016
01:06:31,756 --> 01:06:33,756
No. This was the third time.

1017
01:06:34,517 --> 01:06:35,877
- What?
- Yes.

1018
01:06:35,997 --> 01:06:38,797
The first time was two hours ago
by the boat.

1019
01:06:40,638 --> 01:06:43,598
- Second time, elevator.
- And the night is young.

1020
01:06:43,918 --> 01:06:45,038
Yeah.

1021
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:50,279
What was that?

1022
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:52,039
The Tullens?

1023
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:53,720
Let's go find out.

1024
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,840
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Look at me.

1025
01:07:05,762 --> 01:07:07,322
- Hi.
- Hi.

1026
01:07:11,163 --> 01:07:12,763
- Hi.
- Hi.

1027
01:07:16,804 --> 01:07:18,964
- Hi.
- Hi.

1028
01:07:22,244 --> 01:07:23,805
- Hi.
- Hi.

1029
01:07:26,965 --> 01:07:27,885
Hi.

1030
01:07:28,005 --> 01:07:28,926
- Hi.
- Hi.

1031
01:07:30,326 --> 01:07:31,326
Hi.

1032
01:07:32,366 --> 01:07:34,246
- What time is it?
- Yeah.

1033
01:07:34,326 --> 01:07:35,847
I have to drive.

1034
01:07:37,807 --> 01:07:40,327
Irv! I don't know how you do it.

1035
01:07:41,128 --> 01:07:44,568
Little blue pill. Pfizer make it.
Medicare pay for it.

1036
01:07:47,089 --> 01:07:48,489
I'm sweating.

1037
01:07:48,649 --> 01:07:50,369
Oh! Hello.

1038
01:07:51,129 --> 01:07:53,250
Hot in your rooms, too, is it?

1039
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:56,890
Yeah, it's hot. It's...

1040
01:07:58,851 --> 01:08:00,251
- Dorcas?
- Yes?

1041
01:08:00,811 --> 01:08:04,652
- Irv, do you wanna do something crazy?
- What did you have in mind?

1042
01:08:04,852 --> 01:08:06,332
A little swap.

1043
01:08:07,612 --> 01:08:09,292
I think I'm gonna need another blue pill.

1044
01:08:09,412 --> 01:08:11,173
Not that kind of swap!

1045
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:19,334
Poor Nico. Did you hurt your lip?

1046
01:08:19,414 --> 01:08:21,054
No, it's nothing.

1047
01:08:21,134 --> 01:08:22,815
You hurt your head.

1048
01:08:23,215 --> 01:08:26,575
Poor Nico, let me kiss it better.

1049
01:08:29,296 --> 01:08:32,296
Now I'll buy us all a drink. Waiter!

1050
01:08:45,658 --> 01:08:46,619
Yes.

1051
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,622
I feel so tired.

1052
01:09:08,862 --> 01:09:10,903
- Good night.
- Good night.

1053
01:09:11,543 --> 01:09:12,943
Good night.

1054
01:09:15,063 --> 01:09:16,744
Good night, you two.

1055
01:09:35,067 --> 01:09:37,787
- Good morning, good morning.
- Good morning.

1056
01:09:38,267 --> 01:09:39,467
Good morning.

1057
01:09:39,547 --> 01:09:40,548
- Hey!
- Ahhh!

1058
01:09:41,228 --> 01:09:42,348
Gotcha.

1059
01:09:43,668 --> 01:09:45,268
- Irv.
- Gesundheit.

1060
01:09:46,429 --> 01:09:47,669
- Good morning.
- Hey, rip-snort.

1061
01:09:47,749 --> 01:09:49,349
Okay. Right back at you.

1062
01:09:49,469 --> 01:09:51,469
- Hot today, huh, Nico?
- So?

1063
01:09:52,029 --> 01:09:53,270
Yo, Gator.

1064
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:55,630
Morning, gang!

1065
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:58,391
Georgia. How are you this morning?

1066
01:09:59,511 --> 01:10:03,071
- Fine, thank you. And how are you?
- Excellent.

1067
01:10:06,752 --> 01:10:08,632
8:00 a.m. and already hot?

1068
01:10:10,032 --> 01:10:11,833
Good morning, Caitlin.

1069
01:10:19,234 --> 01:10:23,115
- Poupi, do you know of a close beach?
- Of course.

1070
01:10:23,235 --> 01:10:26,475
And do you have any
16-year-old handsome nephews?

1071
01:10:27,195 --> 01:10:29,996
- Of course.
- Good. Will you call him for me?

1072
01:10:30,276 --> 01:10:31,716
- Good.
- Hey, wait.

1073
01:10:31,836 --> 01:10:33,076
- Yes.
- Why?

1074
01:10:33,636 --> 01:10:35,837
I like to keep my options open.

1075
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:45,238
Wow! Is it hot, huh? Sorry about that.

1076
01:10:46,599 --> 01:10:49,519
Poupi? What do you say we try the AC?

1077
01:10:51,239 --> 01:10:53,120
- Are you sure?
- Well...

1078
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,320
MR. TULLEN: Oh, no, please.

1079
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:57,240
I don't want to be asphyxiated
all over again.

1080
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,481
Well, Irv?
Maybe you could work your magic?

1081
01:11:02,121 --> 01:11:05,562
Boogie-woogie, bully-bully.
Whirlpool working!

1082
01:11:09,642 --> 01:11:11,083
Hey, it works!

1083
01:11:12,483 --> 01:11:13,883
That's lovely.

1084
01:11:13,963 --> 01:11:15,243
That's great, Irvinator.

1085
01:11:18,604 --> 01:11:21,124
We've got a packed schedule today.
The Mycenaean tombs,

1086
01:11:21,204 --> 01:11:25,005
a tour of a monastery,
then a stop at the Thessaloniki Museum.

1087
01:11:27,525 --> 01:11:32,846
But we're not doing any of that.
Because Caitlin wants to go to the beach.

1088
01:11:34,647 --> 01:11:36,727
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1089
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:39,327
Hit it, Poupi.

1090
01:11:40,888 --> 01:11:43,048
And now we dance.

1091
01:11:46,449 --> 01:11:48,249
Georgia's got some moves!

1092
01:11:48,369 --> 01:11:49,569
- Here we go.
- No, I'm not dancing.

1093
01:11:49,649 --> 01:11:52,650
- Come on, come on. Up you get.
- No, no. I'm not.

1094
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:58,291
Come on! Everybody up!
Put your arms like this! Yes!

1095
01:12:20,014 --> 01:12:21,454
This is great!

1096
01:12:29,336 --> 01:12:30,936
And go!

1097
01:12:31,056 --> 01:12:33,296
Come on! Come on! Come on!

1098
01:12:38,417 --> 01:12:40,698
I've got money in my pocket

1099
01:12:40,818 --> 01:12:42,938
I've got loving in the air

1100
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:45,258
There is nothing that will stop me

1101
01:12:45,338 --> 01:12:47,499
And I really just don't care

1102
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:52,340
Elizabeth, dear,
do please come out of there.

1103
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:55,140
DR. TULLEN: I won't, I don't want to
get sunburned.

1104
01:12:56,420 --> 01:13:00,541
If you don't come out,
I'm going to tell everyone how old you are.

1105
01:13:02,101 --> 01:13:03,581
You know you set my world on fire

1106
01:13:03,701 --> 01:13:06,942
- It's got to be love
- It's got to be love from the very start

1107
01:13:07,062 --> 01:13:08,942
It's got to be love not a broken heart

1108
01:13:09,062 --> 01:13:11,703
Well, that was certainly worth the wait.

1109
01:13:11,783 --> 01:13:13,463
You know you set my world on fire

1110
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:16,144
- It's got to be love
- It's got to be love from the very start

1111
01:13:16,224 --> 01:13:17,824
Here. My nephew.

1112
01:13:17,984 --> 01:13:22,305
Feel like jumping in the river
or dancing in the rain

1113
01:13:22,745 --> 01:13:27,025
The different places smiling faces
It always make my day

1114
01:13:27,145 --> 01:13:31,466
And all are happy people
just following your dream

1115
01:13:31,906 --> 01:13:35,907
'Cause everything you want
is not a fly-by fantasy

1116
01:13:38,467 --> 01:13:41,148
- What's your name?
- Caitlin. What's yours?

1117
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:43,428
I'm Doudi, Doudi Kakas.

1118
01:13:46,349 --> 01:13:47,389
Of course.

1119
01:13:47,869 --> 01:13:50,709
- It's got to be love
- It's got to be love from the very start

1120
01:13:50,789 --> 01:13:53,030
It's got to be love not a broken heart

1121
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:55,830
Come on! Get in there! Tsunami time!

1122
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:57,390
You know you set my world on fire

1123
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:59,871
- It's got to be love
- It's got to be love from the very start

1124
01:13:59,991 --> 01:14:01,871
It's got to be love not a broken heart

1125
01:14:01,991 --> 01:14:04,552
- It's got to be love
- It's got to be love my one true desire

1126
01:14:04,672 --> 01:14:07,032
You know you set my world on fire

1127
01:14:16,794 --> 01:14:18,154
- It's got to be love
- It's got to be love from the very start

1128
01:14:18,274 --> 01:14:20,354
You know you set my world on fire

1129
01:14:20,474 --> 01:14:22,915
It's got to be love

1130
01:14:22,995 --> 01:14:24,995
You know you set my world on fire

1131
01:14:27,475 --> 01:14:28,556
Here.

1132
01:14:36,197 --> 01:14:38,597
A woman sends me kisses on the wind.

1133
01:14:46,439 --> 01:14:47,919
Hoping they will bring love to her.

1134
01:14:47,919 --> 01:14:48,839
Hoping they will bring love to her.

1135
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,921
She's waiting for a long time.

1136
01:15:19,244 --> 01:15:20,884
You waited too long.

1137
01:15:21,885 --> 01:15:25,325
Well, I had to give you a few years
to sow some wild oats.

1138
01:15:25,885 --> 01:15:27,365
You're welcome!

1139
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:31,086
I've missed you.

1140
01:15:33,046 --> 01:15:35,087
Not as much as I missed you.

1141
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:41,968
...of a woman in love.

1142
01:15:50,649 --> 01:15:52,090
That's lovely.

1143
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:54,930
Classic.

1144
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:58,011
- All right, who wants the last pancake?
- Delicious.

1145
01:15:58,131 --> 01:16:00,011
Hook me up! Hook me up now!

1146
01:16:00,331 --> 01:16:02,531
I feel like I've had a month of Sundays.

1147
01:16:02,651 --> 01:16:04,652
I'm gonna re-up the firewood
to get a bigger fire.

1148
01:16:04,732 --> 01:16:07,612
Hey, I've got something better for that fire.

1149
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:08,812
Whoa!

1150
01:16:11,413 --> 01:16:13,173
Yes! Yeah!

1151
01:16:14,213 --> 01:16:15,413
She did it.

1152
01:16:15,533 --> 01:16:17,094
That really burns.

1153
01:16:17,374 --> 01:16:18,814
It's a blazer!

1154
01:16:20,814 --> 01:16:22,375
Keep your day job.

1155
01:16:23,895 --> 01:16:25,495
- All right.
- What?

1156
01:16:25,615 --> 01:16:27,175
- Oh, yeah.
- Not the cell phone.

1157
01:16:27,295 --> 01:16:28,656
No, no, no, you're not.

1158
01:16:28,736 --> 01:16:30,416
Yes! Yes! Burn it.

1159
01:16:32,056 --> 01:16:34,017
I cannot believe you just did that.

1160
01:16:34,137 --> 01:16:35,497
I feel lighter.

1161
01:16:35,617 --> 01:16:37,457
I can't believe it. Irv?

1162
01:16:38,657 --> 01:16:39,938
- Irv!
- Wait.

1163
01:16:40,498 --> 01:16:42,178
- What happened?
- Irv.

1164
01:16:43,418 --> 01:16:45,058
- Irv!
- What's wrong?

1165
01:16:48,579 --> 01:16:50,739
- Call an ambulance!
- I'll do it.

1166
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:53,860
DR. TULLEN: Now, you stay with us!
And you listen to my voice, all right?

1167
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:55,860
Irv? Irv?

1168
01:16:57,781 --> 01:17:00,861
So we've been told the hospital
is keeping him for observation.

1169
01:17:00,941 --> 01:17:02,581
They're gonna run some tests and...

1170
01:17:02,661 --> 01:17:04,982
- When does he get out?
- Well, they're not sure, Gator.

1171
01:17:05,062 --> 01:17:08,502
They really aren't. The doctors actually
won't know anything until he wakes up.

1172
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:11,583
But, look, they don't know Irv
like we do, right?

1173
01:17:11,703 --> 01:17:13,343
- Right.
- Yeah.

1174
01:17:14,183 --> 01:17:16,224
All right. This is the propylaeum.

1175
01:17:16,344 --> 01:17:18,704
Just up those stairs is the Parthenon.

1176
01:17:19,304 --> 01:17:21,184
How many more stairs?

1177
01:17:21,504 --> 01:17:23,905
About 30, 50. A lot.

1178
01:17:25,225 --> 01:17:26,505
It's okay.

1179
01:17:27,065 --> 01:17:31,506
We're tired, and the stress of Irv is... Yeah.

1180
01:17:32,946 --> 01:17:35,187
Anyone who wants to, follow me.

1181
01:18:03,151 --> 01:18:04,792
Incredible, isn't it?

1182
01:18:06,352 --> 01:18:08,512
- Tell us about it.
- Yeah, what's the John Dory?

1183
01:18:08,592 --> 01:18:12,953
Well, we have traveled
within a very mysterious triangle.

1184
01:18:13,753 --> 01:18:16,354
Delphi, Athens, Olympia.

1185
01:18:17,194 --> 01:18:22,555
And this city, Athens, got its name
from the goddess of wisdom, Athena.

1186
01:18:23,275 --> 01:18:26,115
And the Parthenon was built to honor her.

1187
01:18:26,515 --> 01:18:28,516
It was finished in 432 B.C.

1188
01:18:31,516 --> 01:18:33,877
Let me tell you why I love it here.

1189
01:18:35,357 --> 01:18:38,917
Listen to the sound of the wind
blowing through the columns.

1190
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:50,679
That is the same wind that
mankind has listened to for centuries.

1191
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:56,120
It's the sound of nature
meeting human imagination.

1192
01:18:58,681 --> 01:19:01,241
And for me, that's history.

1193
01:19:04,042 --> 01:19:05,842
I tell you what, Angie.

1194
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:08,682
It's just plain beautiful. That's what it is.

1195
01:19:08,762 --> 01:19:11,283
- It was lovely.
- Best thing I ever set eyes on.

1196
01:19:11,403 --> 01:19:13,043
It's Greek-alicious.

1197
01:19:17,284 --> 01:19:18,564
Yes, Gator.

1198
01:19:19,244 --> 01:19:21,044
There's still something I haven't seen.

1199
01:19:21,124 --> 01:19:22,165
What's that?

1200
01:19:22,285 --> 01:19:23,805
A Greek hospital.

1201
01:19:26,085 --> 01:19:27,045
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1202
01:19:27,165 --> 01:19:29,846
- Good call, Gator.
- I'd like to see one of those, too.

1203
01:19:29,926 --> 01:19:32,446
I know a good one. I'll take us all.

1204
01:19:32,966 --> 01:19:35,687
Fine, fine, take your stupid pictures

1205
01:19:35,807 --> 01:19:38,047
and I go get you some ice cream.

1206
01:19:38,567 --> 01:19:40,248
Good morning, Nico.

1207
01:19:40,608 --> 01:19:43,688
Yeah? I have a headache in my head.

1208
01:19:43,808 --> 01:19:47,289
The bus air conditioner, it break,
and these American idiots

1209
01:19:47,409 --> 01:19:49,809
never stops to complain,
complain, complain.

1210
01:19:49,889 --> 01:19:51,410
Wait a minute!

1211
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:54,370
Did you just call us Americans?

1212
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:57,210
Americans, Canadians.
What's the difference?

1213
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:58,491
You jerk!

1214
01:20:06,332 --> 01:20:07,732
Runs like a sheila!

1215
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:12,693
And the Greek word for hospital
is nosocomio.

1216
01:20:12,773 --> 01:20:13,773
Say it with me.

1217
01:20:15,133 --> 01:20:17,614
Very good. This is one of
the finest hospitals in Athens.

1218
01:20:17,734 --> 01:20:19,614
Only the best for our Irv.

1219
01:20:20,494 --> 01:20:21,855
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Irv!

1220
01:20:24,095 --> 01:20:25,015
Dude!

1221
01:20:26,215 --> 01:20:27,295
This nice guy is for you.

1222
01:20:27,416 --> 01:20:28,976
You coming
to the farewell party tonight, then?

1223
01:20:29,096 --> 01:20:30,096
Here you go, mate,
shove that down your gullet.

1224
01:20:30,216 --> 01:20:32,136
This is great. Thank you, all.

1225
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,857
- Looking good, Irv.
- Made in America, Irv.

1226
01:20:35,177 --> 01:20:36,417
Because you missed the Parthenon.

1227
01:20:36,537 --> 01:20:39,658
- Wear it in good health, boss.
- You're in the pink, Irv.

1228
01:20:39,778 --> 01:20:40,898
Friends.

1229
01:20:41,898 --> 01:20:43,058
This is great.

1230
01:20:43,178 --> 01:20:45,619
So many visitors. Nice.

1231
01:20:46,059 --> 01:20:48,459
- Now get out, yes.
- Take care of him.

1232
01:20:49,019 --> 01:20:50,419
Get well, Irv.

1233
01:20:51,139 --> 01:20:53,500
- You're looking good, Irv.
- Hey, stay up, man.

1234
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,620
- Yo, Gator.
- On you, mate.

1235
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:59,141
- Bye, Irv.
- Dorcas.

1236
01:21:01,901 --> 01:21:03,061
Bye, Irv.

1237
01:21:05,982 --> 01:21:07,222
Thank you.

1238
01:21:08,542 --> 01:21:09,863
My pleasure.

1239
01:21:30,586 --> 01:21:31,906
Say, "Cheese."

1240
01:21:33,707 --> 01:21:36,867
Great buffet, Ange.
These baklavas are a riot.

1241
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:42,148
Angie, I've got benecoupola and dolmades
and they look very good.

1242
01:21:42,228 --> 01:21:46,309
- Or, as they say in Greek, poli kala.
- That's pretty good.

1243
01:21:46,389 --> 01:21:50,149
Hey, listen, it's not a big deal,
but my name is not Angie or Ange.

1244
01:21:50,229 --> 01:21:52,270
Yeah. We know. It's Georgia.

1245
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:55,030
So why do you call me Angie?

1246
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:58,311
Look at you.
You look just like Angelina Jolie.

1247
01:21:58,791 --> 01:22:00,911
You know,
that actress that adopts everybody.

1248
01:22:01,031 --> 01:22:03,872
- We love her.
- You must get that all the time.

1249
01:22:04,392 --> 01:22:06,152
Yes, I do. Yes.

1250
01:22:09,313 --> 01:22:10,833
Look who's here.

1251
01:22:14,433 --> 01:22:16,234
- Hi.
- Caitlin, hi.

1252
01:22:16,954 --> 01:22:18,674
- For you.
- Thank you.

1253
01:22:18,754 --> 01:22:20,674
MR. TULLEN: Let's have a look at you.

1254
01:22:20,794 --> 01:22:23,675
No, I cannot count the ways

1255
01:22:24,635 --> 01:22:28,116
You have made my life so blessed

1256
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:32,156
All I know is that you came

1257
01:22:32,276 --> 01:22:35,797
And made beauty of my mess

1258
01:22:35,877 --> 01:22:39,438
You make me happy

1259
01:22:39,518 --> 01:22:42,278
You make me feel the way I do

1260
01:22:42,398 --> 01:22:43,638
Hey, Poups.

1261
01:22:44,478 --> 01:22:48,919
You know, you turned out to be all right
for a guy that doesn't say much.

1262
01:22:50,599 --> 01:22:53,480
- Am I interrupting something?
- It's all right.

1263
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,600
Excuse me.

1264
01:22:57,521 --> 01:22:59,561
- I'll get some wine.
- Okay.

1265
01:22:59,681 --> 01:23:01,681
Georgie, I got these for you.

1266
01:23:01,761 --> 01:23:03,962
Dorcas, you shouldn't do this.

1267
01:23:04,762 --> 01:23:07,122
It's all right. I've got the receipt.

1268
01:23:08,322 --> 01:23:10,843
- Good for you.
- Well, it's a start.

1269
01:23:14,883 --> 01:23:15,804
Oh.

1270
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,844
- Georgia. I saw you.
- Good.

1271
01:23:19,644 --> 01:23:21,525
To my hand you can speak.

1272
01:23:22,445 --> 01:23:24,445
You wrote this. "Excellent."

1273
01:23:24,685 --> 01:23:27,366
"Georgia is terrific."
"Georgia is wonderful."

1274
01:23:27,486 --> 01:23:30,326
"You are so lucky
to have someone like Angie."

1275
01:23:30,406 --> 01:23:32,366
I look like Angelina Jolie.

1276
01:23:32,486 --> 01:23:34,327
No, you don't. Who wrote this?

1277
01:23:34,407 --> 01:23:36,527
- I did. I wrote that.
- I did.

1278
01:23:36,647 --> 01:23:38,847
- I did.
- I totally did.

1279
01:23:38,927 --> 01:23:40,768
- We love Angie.
- Georgia.

1280
01:23:40,848 --> 01:23:42,528
- She's the best.
- Thank you, guys.

1281
01:23:42,608 --> 01:23:44,568
It's a fluke. So no raise.

1282
01:23:44,648 --> 01:23:45,689
Fine.

1283
01:23:46,409 --> 01:23:48,969
All right, 10%. That's as high as I go.

1284
01:23:49,089 --> 01:23:50,089
Okay.

1285
01:23:50,569 --> 01:23:51,930
You didn't get a letter from me, did you?

1286
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:54,450
Sure I did. Butt-smoocher.

1287
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:59,131
"Dear Maria,
you are my only friend in Greece."

1288
01:23:59,531 --> 01:24:01,731
The rest got stained. Coffee?

1289
01:24:03,932 --> 01:24:04,932
Coffee?

1290
01:24:05,052 --> 01:24:07,812
Everybody should take the time
for a coffee.

1291
01:24:08,132 --> 01:24:11,253
I've heard everyone should take time
for a coffee.

1292
01:24:11,373 --> 01:24:13,893
I just said that. What?

1293
01:24:14,693 --> 01:24:16,894
You found your kefi.

1294
01:24:17,654 --> 01:24:18,694
Yes.

1295
01:24:19,734 --> 01:24:21,735
And who the hell are you?

1296
01:24:22,215 --> 01:24:23,055
- Procopi.
- Who?

1297
01:24:23,055 --> 01:24:24,015
- Procopi.
- Who?

1298
01:24:24,575 --> 01:24:27,336
- Poupi Kakas.
- Shut up.

1299
01:24:27,936 --> 01:24:30,616
Maria, will you make me a full-time driver?

1300
01:24:30,736 --> 01:24:35,097
Okay. Georgia, 20%. That's as high as I go.

1301
01:24:35,217 --> 01:24:37,577
Okay. Why are you being nice to me?

1302
01:24:44,298 --> 01:24:46,699
- It's open.
- Michigan University.

1303
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:48,979
You got the job there.

1304
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:57,941
I have a job here.

1305
01:25:00,061 --> 01:25:04,622
And it won't be easy.
Nico? He quit. Mama's boy.

1306
01:25:05,262 --> 01:25:07,582
I knew his father. Same thing.

1307
01:25:08,822 --> 01:25:11,543
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1308
01:25:12,263 --> 01:25:14,623
- lf you'll be my driver.
- Of course.

1309
01:25:16,024 --> 01:25:18,864
- Will you hold on just a second?
- I'm waiting.

1310
01:25:22,105 --> 01:25:24,065
Everyone. Everyone.

1311
01:25:24,185 --> 01:25:27,666
I'm so happy I met you,
and I'm gonna miss you all.

1312
01:25:28,386 --> 01:25:29,826
To Georgia!

1313
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,226
To Georgia!

1314
01:25:32,666 --> 01:25:34,507
- To Irv!
- To the Irvinator.

1315
01:25:36,187 --> 01:25:38,707
Okay, so I'm staying in Greece.

1316
01:25:39,748 --> 01:25:42,028
I have no idea what's going to happen.

1317
01:25:42,108 --> 01:25:45,109
But as the man says,
"How do you plan life?"

1318
01:25:45,749 --> 01:25:48,469
I've waited a long time to be this happy.

1319
01:25:49,349 --> 01:25:51,430
And the thing about happy...

1320
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:54,070
Wait. What was I saying?

1321
01:25:54,710 --> 01:25:57,031
Yeah, I'm gonna enjoy it.

1322
01:26:06,792 --> 01:26:09,153
- Teach me to dance.
- Dance?

1323
01:26:10,113 --> 01:26:11,953
Did you say dance?

1324
01:26:17,794 --> 01:26:19,914
And now we dance.
